                            <p><label>Context:</label> The coronary arteries are one of the medically most relevant vessels. They are often affected in diseases like atherosclerosis leading to blockage of the coronary arteries eventually results in heart attacks. If we want to regenerate the coronary arteries or help them during disease we first need to know how they are build up.</p>
                            <p><label>What is Known:</label> It is known that epicardial cells, which are the cells on the surface of the heart, eventually turn into smooth muscle cells deep in the heart. Smooth muscle cells are an essential cell type around the coronary arteries which is very important for homeostasis and is often affected in diseases like atherosclerosis. </p>
                            <p><label>What is Not Known:</label> Since epicardial cells and coronary artery smooth muscle cells never appear together we know that there must be a progenitor cell linking both cell types.</p>
                            <p><label>Experimental Question:</label> We wanted to discover the progenitor cell derived from the epicardium which differentiates into coronary artery smooth muscle cells.</p>
                            <p><label>Main Findings:</label> We discovered that pericytes, which are an important cell type wrapping around small blood vessels, are the progenitor cells to smooth muscle cells. Epicardial cells differentiate into pericytes and pericytes differentiate into coronary artery smooth muscle cells when they are located at a specialized zone in the heart called the remodeling zone and receive arterial blood flow.</p>
                            <p><label>Implications:</label> If we know where smooth muscle cells in the heart come from, then we might be able to block this pathway during diseases with excessive smooth muscle cells (like atherosclerosis). Furthermore, since we show that pericytes still stick around in adult hearts they may be natural progenitors which could be recruited after injury or for smooth muscle cell homeostasis.</p>

                            <p><label>Context:</label> The search for the blood forming stem cell began when the scientists realized that animals, who were given a lethal dose of irradiation suffered bone marrow failure and that this failure could be reversed by injecting unirradiated bone marrow cells.</p>
                            <p><label>What is Known:</label> The blood of mice receiving bone marrow transplantation contained many different blood cell types. Certain cells within the donor blood could restore the entire blood system. </p>
                            <p><label>What is Not Known:</label> Experiments could not distinguish between cells that are self-renewing and multipotent progenitor cells that are non-self renewing but have the potential to make different cell types. </p>
                            <p><label>Experimental Question:</label> What is the identity of the self-renewing and pluripotent blood forming stem cell? Can these cells be purified and transplanted into irradiated mice without a blood system and reconstitute the whole blood system? </p>
                            <p><label>Main Findings:</label> We are the first to isolate the blood forming stem cell in mice with a variety of markers. These cells can proliferate and differentiate into different blood lineages including myelomonocytic cells, B-cells or T-cells. 30 of these blood forming stem cells could save 50% of lethally irradiated mice (mice which will die after radiation treatment) and when examining the blood of these surviving mice they constituted of all different blood lineages. </p>
                            <p><label>Implications:</label> The isolation of a pure population of self renewing and pluripotent blood forming stem cells is a requirement for understanding the developmental biology of the blood lymphoid system and also would be instrumental for a number of gene cell and organ replacement therapies depended on bone marrow transplantation. </p>
