Abstract: A new class of functionalized poly-p-xylyene coating has been synthesized to provide switchable and displaceable surface properties for biomaterials. The switchability is achieved through a mechanism for detaching/attaching biomolecules and/or a mechanism through which the programmed restoration of functions or their replacement by other functions can be carried out. This advanced version of poly-p-xylylene comprises an integrated disulfide moiety within the functional side group, and the switching phenomenon between the immobilized functional molecules is triggered by the redox thiol-disulfide interchange reaction. These dynamically well-defined molecules on the surfaces respond simultaneously to altered biological properties and controlled biointerfacial functions, for example, switching wettability or reversibly altered cell adhesion activity. Poly-p-xylylenes are a key player in controlling surface properties for many important applications, such as medical implants, biosensors, bioMEMS devices, and microfluidics. The introduction of this new facet of poly-p-xylylenes enables the dynamic mimicry of biological functions relevant to the design of new biomaterials.


Title #2: Hydroxylated Mesoporous Nanosilica Coated by Polyethyleneimine Coupled with Gadolinium and Folic Acid: A Tumor-Targeted T1 Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agent and Drug Delivery System.

Abstract: A pH-responsive nanoplatform, hydroxylated mesoporous nanosilica (HMNS) coated by polyethyleneimine (PEI) coupled with gadolinium and folic acid (FA) (Gd-FA-Si), was designed to deliver anticancer drug targeting and to promote contrast effect for tumor cells using magnetic resonance (MR) spectrometer. Doxorubicin (DOX) was chosen as the anticancer drug and loaded into nanopores of HMNS, then its release in simulated body fluid could be controlled through adjusting the pH. This nanoplatform could significantly enhance the MR contrast effect, and the highest theoretical relaxivity per nanoplatform could even be approximately 1.28Ã106 mm-1s-1 because of the high Gd payload (2.61Ã105 per nanoplatform). The entire system possessed a high targeting performance to Hela and MDA-MB-231 cells because the FA located in the system could specifically bind to the folate-receptor sites on the surface of cell. Compared with free DOX, the nanoplatform presented a higher cell inhibition effect on the basis of cell assay. Therefore, this nanoplatform could be potentially applied as a tumor-targeted T1 MR contrast agent and pH-sensitive drug carrier system.


Title #3: Alternating current line-filter based on electrochemical capacitor utilizing template-patterned graphene.

Abstract: Aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) are widely used for alternating current (ac) line-filtering. However, their bulky size is becoming more and more incompatible with the rapid development of portable electronics. Here we report a scalable process to fabricate miniaturized graphene-based ac line-filters on flexible substrates at room temperature. In this work, graphene oxide (GO) is reduced by patterned metal interdigits at room temperature and used directly as the electrode material. The as-fabricated device shows a phase angle of -75.4Â° at 120âHz with a specific capacitance of 316âÂµF/cm(2) and a RC time constant of 0.35âms. In addition, it retains 97.2% of the initial capacitance after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. These outstanding performance characteristics of our device demonstrate its promising to replace the conventional AECs for ac line filtering.


Title #4: Trehalose Analogues: Latest Insights in Properties and Biocatalytic Production.
PMID: 26084050
Authors: Maarten M. Walmagh, Renfei R. Zhao, Tom T. Desmet
Abstract: Trehalose (Î±-d-glucopyranosyl Î±-d-glucopyranoside) is a non-reducing sugar with unique stabilizing properties due to its symmetrical, low energy structure consisting of two 1,1-anomerically bound glucose moieties. Many applications of this beneficial sugar have been reported in the novel food (nutricals), medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Trehalose analogues, like lactotrehalose (Î±-d-glucopyranosyl Î±-d-galactopyranoside) or galactotrehalose (Î±-d-galactopyranosyl Î±-d-galactopyranoside), offer similar benefits as trehalose, but show additional features such as prebiotic or low-calorie sweetener due to their resistance against hydrolysis during digestion. Unfortunately, large-scale chemical production processes for trehalose analogues are not readily available at the moment due to the lack of efficient synthesis methods. Most of the procedures reported in literature suffer from low yields, elevated costs and are far from environmentally friendly. "Greener" alternatives found in the biocatalysis field, including galactosidases, trehalose phosphorylases and TreT-type trehalose synthases are suggested as primary candidates for trehalose analogue production instead. Significant progress has been made in the last decade to turn these into highly efficient biocatalysts and to broaden the variety of useful donor and acceptor sugars. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the latest insights and future perspectives in trehalose analogue chemistry, applications and production pathways with emphasis on biocatalysis.


Title #5: Enzymatic Synthesis of Galactosylated Serine/Threonine Derivatives by Î²-Galactosidase from Escherichia coli.
PMID: 26084049
Authors: Sooyoun S. Seo, Joseph J. Rebehmed, Alexandre G AG. de Brevern, Salwa S. Karboune
Abstract: The transgalactosylations of serine/threonine derivatives were investigated using Î²-galactosidase from Escherichia coli as biocatalyst. Using ortho-nitrophenyl-Î²-D-galactoside as donor, the highest bioconversion yield of transgalactosylated N-carboxy benzyl L-serine benzyl ester (23.2%) was achieved in heptane:buffer medium (70:30), whereas with the lactose, the highest bioconversion yield (3.94%) was obtained in the buffer reaction system. The structures of most abundant galactosylated serine products were characterized by MS/MS. The molecular docking simulation revealed that the binding of serine/threonine derivatives to the enzyme's active site was stronger (-4.6~-7.9 kcal/mol) than that of the natural acceptor, glucose, and mainly occurred through interactions with aromatic residues. For N-tert-butoxycarbonyl serine methyl ester (6.8%) and N-carboxybenzyl serine benzyl ester (3.4%), their binding affinities and the distances between their hydroxyl side chain and the 1'-OH group of galactose moiety were in good accordance with the quantified bioconversion yields. Despite its lower predicted bioconversion yield, the high experimental bioconversion yield obtained with N-carboxybenzyl serine methyl ester (23.2%) demonstrated the importance of the thermodynamically-driven nature of the transgalactosylation reaction.


Title #6: Proteomic Analysis of Immature Fraxinus mandshurica Cotyledon Tissues during Somatic Embryogenesis: Effects of Explant Browning on Somatic Embryogenesis.
PMID: 26084048
Authors: Chun-Ping CP. Liu, Ling L. Yang, Hai-Long HL. Shen
Abstract: Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr.) is a valuable hardwood species in Northeast China. In cultures of F. mandshurica, somatic embryos were produced mainly on browned explants. Therefore, we studied the mechanism of explant browning and its relationship with somatic embryogenesis (SE). We used explants derived from F. mandshurica immature zygotic embryo cotyledons as materials. Proteins were extracted from browned embryogenic explants, browned non-embryogenic explants, and non-brown explants, and then separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Differentially and specifically expressed proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins involved in the browning of explants and SE. Some stress response and defense proteins such as chitinases, peroxidases, aspartic proteinases, and an osmotin-like protein played important roles during SE of F. mandshurica. Our results indicated that explant browning might not be caused by the accumulation and oxidation of polyphenols only, but also by some stress-related processes, which were involved in programmed cell death (PCD), and then induced SE.


Title #7: Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Predominant Alterations in Lipid Metabolism Following Light Exposure in Broccoli Sprouts.

Abstract: The consumption of vegetables belonging to the family Brassicaceae (e.g., broccoli and cauliflower) is linked to a reduced incidence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The molecular composition of such plants is strongly affected by growing conditions. Here we developed an unbiased metabolomics approach to investigate the effect of light and dark exposure on the metabolome of broccoli sprouts and we applied such an approach to provide a bird's-eye view of the overall metabolic response after light exposure. Broccoli seeds were germinated and grown hydroponically for five days in total darkness or with a light/dark photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark cycle). We used an ultra-performance liquid-chromatography system coupled to an ion-mobility, time-of-flight mass spectrometer to profile the large array of metabolites present in the sprouts. Differences at the metabolite level between groups were analyzed using multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis and correlation analysis. Altered metabolites were identified by searching publicly available and in-house databases. Metabolite pathway analyses were used to support the identification of subtle but significant changes among groups of related metabolites that may have gone unnoticed with conventional approaches. Besides the chlorophyll pathway, light exposure activated the biosynthesis and metabolism of sterol lipids, prenol lipids, and polyunsaturated lipids, which are essential for the photosynthetic machinery. Our results also revealed that light exposure increased the levels of polyketides, including flavonoids, and oxylipins, which play essential roles in the plant's developmental processes and defense mechanism against herbivores. This study highlights the significant contribution of light exposure to the ultimate metabolic phenotype, which might affect the cellular physiology and nutritional value of broccoli sprouts. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of an unbiased omics approach for the comprehensive study of the metabolism.

Abstract: Nanofibers are one-dimensional nanomaterial in fiber form with diameter less than 1 Âµm and an aspect ratio (length/diameter) larger than 100:1. Among the different types of nanoparticle-loaded nanofiber systems, nanofibers loaded with magnetic nanoparticles have gained much attention from biomedical scientists due to a synergistic effect obtained from the unique properties of both the nanofibers and magnetic nanoparticles. These magnetic nanoparticle-encapsulated or -embedded nanofiber systems can be used not only for imaging purposes but also for therapy. In this review, we focused on recent advances in nanofibers loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, their biomedical applications, and future trends in the application of these nanofibers.


Title #9: Enzymatic Polymerization on DNA Modified Gold Nanowire for Label-Free Detection of Pathogen DNA.
PMID: 26084045
Authors: Jaepil J. Jeong, Hyejin H. Kim, Jong Bum JB. Lee
Abstract: This paper presents a label-free biosensor for the detection of single-stranded pathogen DNA through the target-enhanced gelation between gold nanowires (AuNW) and the primer DNAs branched on AuNW. The target DNA enables circularization of the linear DNA template, and the primer DNA is elongated continuously via rolling circle amplification. As a result, in the presence of the target DNA, a macroscopic hydrogel was fabricated by the entanglement of the elongated DNA with AuNWs as a scaffold fiber for effective gelation. In contrast, very small separate particles were generated in the absence of the target DNA. This label-free biosensor might be a promising tool for the detection of pathogen DNAs without any devices for further analysis. Moreover, the biosensor based on the weaving of AuNW and DNAs suggests a novel direction for the applications of AuNWs in biological engineering.


Title #10: Alleged Detrimental Mutations in the SMPD1 Gene in Patients with Niemann-Pick Disease.
PMID: 26084044
Authors: Cosima C. Rhein, Christiane C. MÃ¼hle, Johannes J. Kornhuber, Martin M. Reichel
Abstract: Loss-of-function mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene are associated with decreased catalytic activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and are the cause of the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A and B. Currently, >100 missense mutations in SMPD1 are listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database. However, not every sequence variation in SMPD1 is detrimental and gives rise to NPD. We have analysed several alleged SMPD1 missense mutations mentioned in a recent publication and found them to be common variants of SMPD1 that give rise to normal in vivo and in vitro ASM activity.

Title #11: Human Gingival Integration-Free iPSCs; a Source for MSC-Like Cells.
PMID: 26084043
Authors: Yasuyuki Y. Umezaki, Yoshiya Y. Hashimoto, Naoki N. Nishishita, Shin S. Kawamata, Shunsuke S. Baba
Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a potential autologous therapy for tissue engineering. The available procedures for MSC retrieval from patients are invasive, and their limited in vitro proliferation restricts their use in the treatment of damaged tissues. Therefore, it is important to establish an alternative and safe source of MSCs. The objective of this study was to demonstrate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation from a combination of an accessible source tissue and an integration-free method; we also attempted the differentiation of iPSCs into MSC-like cells (MSLCs) for future autologous tissue engineering. iPSCs were derived from human gingival tissues, which are easily accessible in the field of dentistry, via the use of non-integrating episomal plasmids. Established iPSCs expressed embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific markers, as assessed by gene analysis and immunocytochemistry. Embryoid bodies and teratoma formation were formed from iPSCs, showing their capacity to differentiate into three germ layers. Furthermore, we were successful in differentiating iPSCs into MSLCs. They tested positively for their capacity of trilineage differentiation. Our results demonstrate that human gingival integration-free iPSCs, readily accessible stem cells generated using episomal plasmid vectors, are a promising source of MSLCs, which can be used in tissue regeneration.


Title #12: Colorectal Cancer Classification and Cell Heterogeneity: A Systems Oncology Approach.
PMID: 26084042
Authors: MoisÃ©s M. Blanco-Calvo, Ãngel Ã. Concha, AngÃ©lica A. Figueroa, Federico F. Garrido, Manuel M. Valladares-Ayerbes
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease that manifests through diverse clinical scenarios. During many years, our knowledge about the variability of colorectal tumors was limited to the histopathological analysis from which generic classifications associated with different clinical expectations are derived. However, currently we are beginning to understand that under the intense pathological and clinical variability of these tumors there underlies strong genetic and biological heterogeneity. Thus, with the increasing available information of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity, the classical pathological approach is being displaced in favor of novel molecular classifications. In the present article, we summarize the most relevant proposals of molecular classifications obtained from the analysis of colorectal tumors using powerful high throughput techniques and devices. We also discuss the role that cancer systems biology may play in the integration and interpretation of the high amount of data generated and the challenges to be addressed in the future development of precision oncology. In addition, we review the current state of implementation of these novel tools in the pathological laboratory and in clinical practice.


Title #13: Association of preS/S Mutations with Occult Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection in South Korea: Transmission Potential of Distinct Occult HBV Variants.
PMID: 26084041
Authors: Hong H. Kim, Bum-Joon BJ. Kim
Abstract: Occult hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is characterized by HBV DNA positivity but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negativity. Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea.


Title #14: Diet Diversity in Pastoral and Agro-pastoral Households in Ugandan Rangeland Ecosystems.
PMID: 26084040
Authors: Maureen M. Mayanja, Chris C. Rubaire-Akiiki, John J. Morton, Stephen S. Young, Ted T. Greiner
Abstract: We explore how diet diversity differs with agricultural seasons and between households within pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood systems, using variety of foods consumed as a less complex proxy indicator of food insecurity than benchmark indicators like anthropometry and serum nutrients. The study was in the central part of the rangelands in Uganda. Seventy nine households were monitored for three seasons, and eight food groups consumed during a 24 hour diet recall period used to create a household diet diversity score (HDDS). Mean HDDS was 3.2, varied significantly with gender, age, livelihood system and season (p < .001, F = 15.04), but not with household size or household head's education level. Agro-pastoralists exhibited lower mean diet diversity than pastoralists (p < .01, F = 7.84) and among agro-pastoralists, households headed by persons over 65 years were most vulnerable (mean HDDS 2.1). This exploratory study raises issues requiring further investigation to inform policies on nutrition security in the two communities.

Title #16: Alkynyl functionalized Al/P-based frustrated Lewis pairs - aluminium alkynide elimination and evidence for the formation of 3H-phosphaallenes [R-P[double bond, length as m-dash]C[double bond, length as m-dash]C(H)-(t)Bu].
PMID: 26084038
Authors: Hans H. KlÃ¶cker, Steffi S. Roters, Alexander A. Hepp, Werner W. Uhl
Abstract: Hydroalumination of dialkynylphosphines, aryl-P(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C-(t)Bu)2 (aryl = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 (), Ph ()), with the bulky dialkylaluminium hydride H-Al[CH(SiMe3)2]2 afforded mixed alkenyl-alkynyl phosphines ( and ) with aluminium atoms in geminal positions to phosphorus. These compounds contain coordinatively unsaturated aluminium and phosphorus atoms and may be applicable as alkynyl functionalised frustrated Lewis pairs. Their unique constitution with dialkylaluminium and alkynyl groups in close proximity favours unusual secondary reactions with the elimination of an aluminium alkynide and formation of reactive 3H-phosphaallenes, aryl-P[double bond, length as m-dash]C[double bond, length as m-dash]C(H)-(t)Bu ( and ), which depending on the steric shielding by the aryl groups, oligomerize at room temperature over days or weeks. The mesityl derivative is formed in a very selective reaction, but the relatively unstable phenyl compound was only detected in a mixture of several components. One of these () was isolated as orange-red crystals and identified as a heterocyclic zwitterionic compound with a central AlC2P2 ring. One of its phosphorus atoms is bonded to a terminal alkynyl group.


Title #17: Default and Executive Network Coupling Supports Creative Idea Production.
PMID: 26084037
Authors: Roger E RE. Beaty, Mathias M. Benedek, Scott S. Barry Kaufman, Paul J PJ. Silvia
Abstract: The role of attention in creative cognition remains controversial. Neuroimaging studies have reported activation of brain regions linked to both cognitive control and spontaneous imaginative processes, raising questions about how these regions interact to support creative thought. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we explored this question by examining dynamic interactions between brain regions during a divergent thinking task. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed a distributed network associated with divergent thinking, including several core hubs of the default (posterior cingulate) and executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) networks. The resting-state network affiliation of these regions was confirmed using data from an independent sample of participants. Graph theory analysis assessed global efficiency of the divergent thinking network, and network efficiency was found to increase as a function of individual differences in divergent thinking ability. Moreover, temporal connectivity analysis revealed increased coupling between default and salience network regions (bilateral insula) at the beginning of the task, followed by increased coupling between default and executive network regions at later stages. Such dynamic coupling suggests that divergent thinking involves cooperation between brain networks linked to cognitive control and spontaneous thought, which may reflect focused internal attention and the top-down control of spontaneous cognition during creative idea production.

Title #19: Oxygen-Sensing Methods in Biomedicine from the Macroscale to the Microscale.
PMID: 26084034
Authors: Emmanuel E. Roussakis, Zongxi Z. Li, Alexander J AJ. Nichols, Conor L CL. Evans
Abstract: Oxygen monitoring has been a topic of exhaustive study given its central role in the biochemistry of life. The ability to quantify the physiological distribution and real-time dynamics of oxygen from sub-cellular to macroscopic levels is required to fully understand the mechanisms associated with both normal physiology and disease states. This Review will present the most significant recent advances in the development of oxygen-sensing materials and techniques, including polarographic, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance, and optical approaches, that can be applied specifically for the real-time monitoring of oxygen dynamics in cellular and tissue environments. As some of the most exciting recent advances in synthetic methods and biomedical applications have been in the field of optical oxygen sensors, a major focus will be on the development of these toolkits.


Title #20: A maximum likelihood approach to diffeomorphic speckle tracking for 3D strain estimation in echocardiography.
PMID: 26084033
Authors: Ariel H AH. Curiale, Gonzalo G. Vegas-SÃ¡nchez-Ferrero, Johan G JG. Bosch, Santiago S. Aja-FernÃ¡ndez
Abstract: The strain and strain-rate measures are commonly used for the analysis and assessment of regional myocardial function. In echocardiography (EC), the strain analysis became possible using Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI). Unfortunately, this modality shows an important limitation: the angle between the myocardial movement and the ultrasound beam should be small to provide reliable measures. This constraint makes it difficult to provide strain measures of the entire myocardium. Alternative non-Doppler techniques such as Speckle Tracking (ST) can provide strain measures without angle constraints. However, the spatial resolution and the noisy appearance of speckle still make the strain estimation a challenging task in EC. Several maximum likelihood approaches have been proposed to statistically characterize the behavior of speckle, which results in a better performance of speckle tracking. However, those models do not consider common transformations to achieve the final B-mode image (e.g. interpolation). This paper proposes a new maximum likelihood approach for speckle tracking which effectively characterizes speckle of the final B-mode image. Its formulation provides a diffeomorphic scheme than can be efficiently optimized with a second-order method. The novelty of the method is threefold: First, the statistical characterization of speckle generalizes conventional speckle models (Rayleigh, Nakagami and Gamma) to a more versatile model for real data. Second, the formulation includes local correlation to increase the efficiency of frame-to-frame speckle tracking. Third, a probabilistic myocardial tissue characterization is used to automatically identify more reliable myocardial motions. The accuracy and agreement assessment was evaluated on a set of 16 synthetic image sequences for three different scenarios: normal, acute ischemia and acute dyssynchrony. The proposed method was compared to six speckle tracking methods. Results revealed that the proposed method is the most accurate method to measure the motion and strain with an average median motion error of 0.42Â mm and a median strain error of 2.0 Â± 0.9%, 2.1 Â± 1.3% and 7.1 Â± 4.9% for circumferential, longitudinal and radial strain respectively. It also showed its capability to identify abnormal segments with reduced cardiac function and timing differences for the dyssynchrony cases. These results indicate that the proposed diffeomorphic speckle tracking method provides robust and accurate motion and strain estimation.


Title #21: Butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced O6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
PMID: 26084032

Abstract: Epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk with high red meat (HRM) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. In the present study, we examined whether a HRM diet increased rectal O6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (O6MeG) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSB) was protective. A group of twenty-three individuals consumed 300Â g/d of cooked red meat without (HRM diet) or with 40Â g/d of HAMSB (HRM+HAMSB diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. Stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. The HRM diet increased rectal O6MeG adducts relative to its baseline by 21Â % (P<Â 0Â·01), whereas the addition of HAMSB to the HRM diet prevented this increase. Epithelial proliferation increased with both the HRM (P<Â 0Â·001) and HRM+HAMSB (P<Â 0Â·05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the HRM+HAMSB diet compared with the HRM diet (P<Â 0Â·05). Relative to its baseline, the HRM+HAMSB diet increased the excretion of SCFA by over 20Â % (P<Â 0Â·05) and increased the absolute abundances of the Clostridium coccoides group (P<Â 0Â·05), the Clostridium leptum group (P<Â 0Â·05), Lactobacillus spp. (P<Â 0Â·01), Parabacteroides distasonis (P<Â 0Â·001) and Ruminococcus bromii (P<Â 0Â·05), but lowered Ruminococcus torques (P<Â 0Â·05) and the proportions of Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Escherichia coli (P<Â 0Â·01). HRM consumption could increase the risk of CRC through increased formation of colorectal epithelial O6MeG adducts. HAMSB consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool SCFA levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

Title #23: GM-CSF Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures Comprise a Heterogeneous Population of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in the immune system. Much of their biology has been elucidated via culture systems in which hematopoietic precursors differentiate into DCs under the aegis of cytokines. A widely used protocol involves the culture of murine bone marrow (BM) cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to generate BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). BMDCs express CD11c and MHC class II (MHCII) molecules and share with DCs isolated from tissues the ability to present exogenous antigens to TÂ cells and to respond to microbial stimuli by undergoing maturation. We demonstrate that CD11c(+)MHCII(+) BMDCs are in fact a heterogeneous group of cells that comprises conventional DCs and monocyte-derived macrophages. DCs and macrophages in GM-CSF cultures both undergo maturation upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide but respond differentially to the stimulus and remain separable entities. These results have important implications for the interpretation of a vast array of data obtained with DC culture systems.

Abstract: The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene is crucial forÂ establishing central immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Mutations in AIRE cause a rare autosomal-recessive disease, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), distinguished by multi-organ autoimmunity. We have identified multiple cases and families with mono-allelic mutations in the first plant homeodomain (PHD1) zinc finger of AIRE that followed dominant inheritance, typically characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared to classical APS-1. These missense PHD1 mutations suppressed gene expression driven by wild-type AIRE in a dominant-negative manner, unlike CARD or truncated AIRE mutants that lacked such dominant capacity. Exome array analysis revealed that the PHD1 dominant mutants were found with relatively high frequency (>0.0008) in mixed populations. Our results provide insight into the molecular action of AIRE and demonstrate that disease-causing mutations in the AIRE locus are more common than previously appreciated and cause more variable autoimmune phenotypes.

Abstract: Research on the human microbiome has established that commensal and pathogenic bacteria can influence obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity through mechanisms mostly unknown. We found that a component of bacterial biofilms, the amyloid protein curli, irreversibly formed fibers with bacterial DNA during biofilm formation. This interaction accelerated amyloid polymerization and created potent immunogenic complexes that activated immune cells, including dendritic cells, to produce cytokines such as type I interferons, which are pathogenic in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). When given systemically, curli-DNA composites triggered immune activation and production of autoantibodies in lupus-prone and wild-type mice. We also found that the infection of lupus-prone mice with curli-producing bacteria triggered higher autoantibody titers compared to curli-deficient bacteria. These data provide a mechanism by which the microbiome and biofilm-producing enteric infections may contribute to the progression of SLE and point to a potential molecular target for treatment of autoimmunity.

Abstract: Immune memory cells are poised to rapidly expand and elaborate effector functions upon reinfection yet exist in a functionally quiescent state. The paradigm is that memory TÂ cells remain inactive due to lack of TÂ cell receptor (TCR) stimuli. Here, we report that regulatory T (Treg) cells orchestrate memory TÂ cell quiescence by suppressing effector and proliferation programs through inhibitory receptor, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4). Loss of Treg cells resulted in activation of genome-wide transcriptional programs characteristic of effector TÂ cells and drove transitioning as well as established memory CD8(+) TÂ cells toward terminally differentiated KLRG-1(hi)IL-7RÎ±(lo)GzmB(hi) phenotype, with compromised metabolic fitness, longevity, polyfunctionality, and protective efficacy. CTLA-4 functionally replaced Treg cells in trans to rescue memory TÂ cell defects and restore homeostasis. These studies present the CTLA-4-CD28-CD80/CD86 axis as a potential target to accelerate vaccine-induced immunityÂ and improve TÂ cell memory quality in current cancer immunotherapies proposing transient Treg cell ablation.

Abstract: Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) emerge during nonresolving peripheral inflammation, but their impact on disease progression remains unknown. We have found in aged Apoe(-/-) mice that artery TLOs (ATLOs) controlled highly territorialized aorta TÂ cell responses. ATLOs promoted TÂ cell recruitment, primed CD4(+) TÂ cells, generated CD4(+), CD8(+), T regulatory (Treg) effector and central memory cells, converted naive CD4(+) TÂ cells into induced Treg cells, and presented antigen by an unusual set of dendritic cells and B cells. Meanwhile, vascular smooth muscle cellÂ lymphotoxin Î² receptors (VSMC-LTÎ²Rs) protected against atherosclerosis by maintaining structure, cellularity, and size of ATLOs though VSMC-LTÎ²Rs did not affect secondary lymphoid organs: Atherosclerosis was markedly exacerbated in Apoe(-/-)Ltbr(-/-) and to a similar extent in aged Apoe(-/-)Ltbr(fl/fl)Tagln-cre mice. These data support the conclusion that the immune system employs ATLOs to organize aorta TÂ cell homeostasis during aging and that VSMC-LTÎ²Rs participate in atherosclerosis protection via ATLOs.


Title #28: E3Â Ubiquitin Ligase VHL Regulates Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1Î± to Maintain Regulatory T Cell Stability and Suppressive Capacity.
PMID: 26084024
Authors: Jee H JH. Lee, Chris C. Elly, Yoon Y. Park, Yun-Cai YC. Liu
Abstract: Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in immune homeostasis; however, the mechanisms to maintain their function remain unclear. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL is essential for Treg cell function. Mice with Foxp3-restricted VHL deletion displayed massive inflammation associated with excessive Treg cell interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) production. VHL-deficient Treg cells failed to prevent colitis induction, but converted into Th1-like effector TÂ cells. VHL intrinsically orchestrated such conversion under both steady and inflammatory conditions followed by Foxp3 downregulation, which was reversed by IFN-Î³ deficiency. Augmented hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±)-induced glycolytic reprogramming was required for IFN-Î³ production. Furthermore, HIF-1Î± bound directly to the Ifng promoter. HIF-1Î± knockdown or knockout could reverse the increased IFN-Î³ by VHL-deficient Treg cells and restore their suppressive function inÂ vivo. These findings indicate that regulation of HIF-1Î± pathway by VHL is crucial to maintain the stability and suppressive function of Foxp3(+) TÂ cells.


Title #29: Complement Regulates Nutrient Influx and Metabolic Reprogramming during Th1 Cell Responses.
PMID: 26084023

Develioglu, Glenn R GR. Bantug, Julie J. Watson, Lionel L. Couzi, Behdad B. Afzali, Paul P. Lavender, Christoph C. Hess, Claudia C. Kemper
Abstract: Expansion and acquisition of Th1 cell effector function requires metabolic reprogramming; however, the signals instructing these adaptations remain poorly defined. Here we found that in activated human TÂ cells, autocrine stimulation of the complement receptor CD46, and specifically its intracellular domain CYT-1, was required for induction of the amino acid (AA) transporter LAT1 and enhanced expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Furthermore, CD46 activation simultaneously drove expression of LAMTOR5, which mediated assembly of the AA-sensing Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 complex and increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), required for cytokine production. TÂ cells from CD46-deficient patients, characterized by defective Th1 cell induction, failed to upregulate the molecular components of this metabolic program as well as glycolysis and OXPHOS, but IFN-Î³ production could be reinstated by retrovirus-mediated CD46-CYT-1 expression. These data establish a critical link between the complement system and immunometabolic adaptations driving human CD4(+) TÂ cell effector function.


Title #30: The MicroRNA-132 and MicroRNA-212 Cluster Regulates Hematopoietic Stem Cell Maintenance and Survival with Age by Buffering FOXO3 Expression.
PMID: 26084022

Abstract: MicroRNAs are critical post-transcriptional regulators of hematopoietic cell-fate decisions, though little remains known about their role in aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We found that the microRNA-212/132 cluster (Mirc19) is enriched in HSCs and is upregulated during aging. Both overexpression and deletion of microRNAs in this cluster leads to inappropriate hematopoiesis with age. Enforced expression of miR-132 in the bone marrow of mice led to rapid HSC cycling and depletion. AÂ genetic deletion of Mirc19 in mice resulted in HSCs that had altered cycling, function, and survival in response to growth factor starvation. We found that miR-132 exerted its effect on aging HSCs by targeting the transcription factor FOXO3, a known aging associated gene. Our data demonstrate that Mirc19 plays a role in maintaining balanced hematopoietic output by buffering FOXO3 expression. We have thus identified it as a potential target that might play a role in age-related hematopoietic defects.


Title #31: Interleukin-33 in Tissue Homeostasis, Injury, and Inflammation.
PMID: 26084021
Authors: Ari B AB. Molofsky, Adam K AK. Savage, Richard M RM. Locksley
Abstract: Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a nuclear-associated cytokine of the IL-1 family originally described as a potent inducer of allergic type 2 immunity. IL-33 signals via the receptor ST2, which is highly expressed on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thus underpinning its association with helminth infection and allergic pathology. Recent studies have revealed ST2 expression on subsets of regulatory TÂ cells, and for a role for IL-33 in tissue homeostasis and repair that suggests previously unrecognized interactions within these cellular networks. IL-33 can participate in pathologic fibrotic reactions, or, in the setting of microbial invasion, can cooperate with inflammatory cytokines to promote responses by cytotoxic NK cells, Th1 cells, and CD8(+) TÂ cells. Here, we highlight the regulation and function of IL-33 and ST2 and review their roles in homeostasis, damage, and inflammation, suggesting a conceptual framework for future studies.


Title #32: Proteolytic Processing of Interleukin-1 Family Cytokines: Variations on a Common Theme.
PMID: 26084020
Authors: Inna S IS. Afonina, Christina C. MÃ¼ller, Seamus J SJ. Martin, Rudi R. Beyaert
Abstract: Members of the extended interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine family, such as IL-1, IL-18, IL-33, and IL-36, play a pivotal role in the initiation and amplification of immune responses. However, deregulated production and/or activation of these cytokines can lead to the development of multiple inflammatory disorders. IL-1 family members share a broadly similar domain organization and receptor signaling pathways. Another striking similarity between IL-1 family members is the requirement for proteolytic processing in order to unlock their full biological potential. Although much emphasis has been put on the role of caspase-1, another emerging theme is the involvement of neutrophil- and mast cell-derived proteases in IL-1 family cytokine processing. Elucidating the regulation of IL-1 family members by proteolytic processing is of great interest for understanding inflammation and immunity. Here, we review the identity of the proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of IL-1 family cytokines and the therapeutic implications in inflammatory disease.


Title #33: A Death Notice for In-Vitro-Generated GM-CSF Dendritic Cells?
PMID: 26084019
Authors: Martin M. Guilliams, Bernard B. Malissen
Abstract: Mouse bone marrow cells cultured with GM-CSF are often used to generate dendritic cells (DCs); in this issue of Immunity, Helft etÂ al. (2015) show that this classical method produces heterogeneous populations of myeloid cells that are only distantly related to macrophages and DCs found inÂ vivo.


Title #34: More than Meets the Eye: Monogenic Autoimmunity Strikes Again.
PMID: 26084018
Authors: Mark S MS. Anderson, Jean-Laurent JL. Casanova
Abstract: Autoimmunity is often familial, suggesting that inborn genetic variations might underlie its development. Curiously, autoimmunity has long been thought to be typically polygenic. Contrary to this prediction and consistent with growing discoveries of monogenic autoimmunity, Oftedal etÂ al. discovered heterozygous dominant-negative AIRE mutations in patients with certain forms of autoimmunity.

PMID: 26084014
Authors: Mark R MR. Boothby, Ariel L AL. Raybuck, Sung Hoon SH. Cho
Abstract: Components of the complement system act directly on TÂ cells to alter conventional and regulatory TÂ cell subsets. In this issue of Immunity, Kolev, Dimeloe, Le Friec etÂ al. (2015) provide evidence of a mechanism by which the complement stimulates sustained mTORC1 activation and regulates cellular metabolism.


Title #39: Effect of Size Selective Retention on the Cotransport of Hydroxyapatite and Goethite Nanoparticles in Saturated Porous Media.
PMID: 26084013
Authors: Dengjun D. Wang, Yan Y. Jin, Deb P DP. Jaisi
Abstract: Attributable to their nanoscale size and slow phosphorus (P) release kinetics, hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) are increasingly advocated as a promising P nanofertilizer. Additionally, HANPs have been extensively used to remediate soils, groundwater, and nuclear wastewaters contaminated with metals and radionuclides. Increasing application of HANPs for agronomic and environmental advantages will expedite their dissemination in subsurface environments. Since the biogeochemical cycling of P is intimately coupled with iron, it is anticipated that HANPs and released P from HANPs interact with iron oxides particularly naturally occurring goethite nanoparticles (GNPs) because of their nanoscale size and high reactivity towards P. Here we investigated the cotransport and retention of HANPs and GNPs in water-saturated sand columns under environmentally relevant transport conditions (pH and natural organic matter type and concentration). Our results indicated that the "size selective retention", i.e., preferential retention of larger particles near the column inlet and elution of smaller particles occurred during cotransport of HANPs and GNPs, and the cotransport of both NPs is highly sensitive to solution chemistry that determines NPs dissolution, homo- and hetero-aggregation, and co- and competitive-retention. These findings have important insights into application of HANPs as a promising P nanofertilizer and an in-situ amendment for contaminated site remediation.


Title #40: Lanthanide complexes with 2-(tosylamino)benzylidene-N-benzoylhydrazone, which exhibit high NIR emission.
PMID: 26084012
Authors: V V VV. Utochnikova, A D AD. Kovalenko, A S AS. Burlov, L. L. Marciniak, I V IV. Ananyev, A S AS. Kalyakina, N A NA. Kurchavov, N P NP. Kuzmina
Abstract: New NIR emitting materials were found among the lanthanide complexes with 2-(tosylamino)benzylidene-N-benzoylhydrazone. Complexes of Nd(3+), Er(3+) and Yb(3+), as well as Eu(3+), Gd(3+) and Lu(3+), were synthesized for the first time. Owing to the absence of vibration quenching the ytterbium complex was found to exhibit a photoluminescence quantum yield of 1.4%. Since the sensitization efficiency was calculated to be 55%, the losses in the quantum yield are probably due to Yb-Yb resonant energy transfer.


Title #41: Odorless, One-Pot Regio- and Stereoselective Iodothiolation of Alkynes with Sodium Arenesulfinates under Metal-Free Conditions in Water.
PMID: 26084011
Authors: Ya-Mei YM. Lin, Guo-Ping GP. Lu, Chun C. Cai, Wen-Bin WB. Yi
Abstract: A newly developed regio- and stereoselective radical addition of alkyne under metal-free conidtions has been disclosed. This chemistry, in which odorless sodium arenesulfinates in place of thiols are used as the sulfur reagent, provides an efficient, one-pot approach for the generation of Î²-iodoalkenyl sulfides, which can be easily further functionalized to derive various alkenes and alkynyl sulfides rendering this methodology attractive to both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

Authors: Sveta S SS. Oza, Mona M. Akbari, CiarÃ¡n P CP. Kelly, Joshua J. Hansen, Thimmaiah T. Theethira, Sohaib S. Tariq, Melinda M. Dennis, Daniel A DA. Leffler
Abstract: Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population and negatively affects aspects of life including physical and social function. The relationship between socioeconomic (SE) factors, symptom severity, and perceived burden of living with CD is not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships between income, symptoms, and perceived burden of CD.


Title #46: Use of Biologics in Pouchitis: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 26084005
Authors: Hans H HH. Herfarth, Millie D MD. Long, Kim L KL. Isaacs
Abstract: Data about the effectiveness of biologics, including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and anti-integrin strategies, in antibiotic refractory pouchitis or Crohn's disease-associated pouch complications are sparse. We performed a systematic review of the literature in Medline and Web of Science. All English language publications and meeting abstracts describing patients with pouchitis treated with anti-TNF or anti-integrin therapies were included. We identified a total of 17 papers and 2 abstracts, most of these retrospective case series, including a total of 192 patients treated either with infliximab (n=140) or adalimumab (n=52). No reports were found for anti-integrin therapies or other anti-TNF agents such as certolizumab pegol or golimumab. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, small numbers of patients, differing cotreatments, and subjective outcome definitions, the exact efficacy of these biological therapies cannot be assessed in a combined fashion. Overall infliximab appears to have good clinical effectiveness in selected patients achieving up to 80% short-term and around 50% long-term response, whereas the few data available for adalimumab are not sufficient to draw valid conclusions. Larger prospectively collected multicenter data with clearly defined inclusion criteria and outcomes are necessary to better define the clinical value of anti-TNF therapy in patients with antibiotic refractory pouchitis or Crohn's-like complications of the pouch.


Title #47: Platelet-bound cyclophilin A in patients with stable coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction.
PMID: 26084004
Authors: Peter P. Seizer, Christian C. Fuchs, Saskia N I V SN. Ungern-Sternberg, David D. Heinzmann, Harald H. Langer, Meinrad M. Gawaz, Andreas E AE. May, Tobias T. Geisler
Abstract: Recently, we reported that extracellular cyclophilin A (CyPA) is an important agonist for platelets. Whereas soluble CyPA-levels have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors, cell-bound CyPA has not been investigated yet. In this study, we analyzed for the first time platelet-bound CyPA in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).


Title #48: Inadequate activation of the HBsAg-specific Th cells by APCs leads to hyporesponsiveness to HBsAg vaccine in B10.S mice.
PMID: 26084003
Authors: Xiaofei X. Li, Jing J. Xu, Zhihui Z. Lv, Jing J. Wang, Shuhui S. Sun, Wei W. Zhu, Bin B. Wang, Rui R. He, Di D. Qu
Abstract: Hepatitis B can be effectively prevented by hepatitis B vaccination. However, hyporesponse to the hepatitis B vaccine has been found in both human and inbred mice with particular MHC alleles or haplotypes, but the mechanisms underlying this poor response remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the hyporesponse to hepatitis B vaccination using B10.S-H2s/SgMcdJ (B10.S, H-2(s), poor responder) and C57BL/10J (B10, H-2(b), good responder) mice. We observed that the B10.S mice displayed a hyporesponse to HBsAg vaccine but a normal response to three other foreign antigens (influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, tetanus toxoid and ovalbumin). In B10.S mice immunized with HBsAg, the levels of serum anti-HBs IgG, the number of HBsAg-specific IgG-secreting plasma cells and HBsAg-specific Th cells were considerably lower than that in B10 mice. Further, the findings of the insufficient maturation (CD86), co-stimulation (CD40) and migration (CCR7) activities of DCs together with the inadequate activation of the HBsAg-specific Th cells by APCs were identified as part of the reason for the HBsAg hyporesponse in B10.S mice, which supports the hypothesis that measures aimed at promoting the maturation, co-stimulation or migration of APCs to enhance Th cell activation may be a useful strategy for the development of new hepatitis B vaccines.


Title #49: Fractalkine in the nervous system: neuroprotective or neurotoxic molecule?
PMID: 26084002
Authors: Clotilde C. Lauro, Myriam M. Catalano, Flavia F. Trettel, Cristina C. Limatola
Abstract: Fractalkine (CX3CL1) is an intriguing chemokine that plays a central role in the nervous system. The expression of CX3CL1 on neurons and of its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia facilitates a privileged interaction, playing important roles in regulating the function and maturation of these cells. CX3CL1 is reported to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities in several experimental systems and animal models of disease, and its expression correlates with positive outcomes in human neuropathologies. However, a comparable amount of evidence shows that CX3CL1 sustains neuroinflammatory conditions and contributes to neurotoxicity. This review discusses the evidence in favor of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair being neuroprotective and other evidence that it is neurotoxic. Our aim is to stimulate future research examining the molecular and cellular determinants responsible for this unique functional switch, which could be important for several neuropathologies.


Title #50: Metallic Burden of Deciduous Teeth and Childhood Behavioral Deficits.
PMID: 26084001
Authors: Tony J H TJ. Chan, Carolina C. Gutierrez, Oladele A OA. Ogunseitan
Abstract: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects 5%-8% of children in the U.S. (10% of males and 4% of females). The contributions of multiple metal exposures to the childhood behavioral deficits are unclear, although particular metals have been implicated through their neurotoxicity. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the body burden of Mn is positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. We also investigated the putative roles of Ca, Fe, Pb, and Hg. We collected shed molars from 266 children (138 boys and 128 girls) who lost a tooth between 11 and 13 years of age. The molars were analyzed for metals using ICP-OES. The third grade teacher of each child completed the Teacher's Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD) to produce a score for "Total Disruptive Behavior" and subscale scores for "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder", Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, Inattention, and Oppositional/Defiant. The mean Mn, Fe, Pb and Ca concentrations found in teeth was 6.1 Â± 5.7 Âµg/g, 22.7 Â± 24.1 Âµg/g, 0.9 Â± 1.4 Âµg/g, and 6.0 Ã 105 Â± 1.6 Ã 105 Âµg/g, respectively. Hg was not detected. No significant association was found between Mn and behavioral deficits. Ca was significantly negatively associated, and Pb showed a significant positive association with Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, Inattention, and Oppositional/Defiant Disorders. These findings call into question the putative independent association of manganese exposure and behavioral deficits in children, when the balance of other metallic burden, particularly Ca and Pb burdens play significant roles.


Title #51: Impacts of Climate Change on Vector Borne Diseases in the Mediterranean Basin - Implications for Preparedness and Adaptation Policy.
PMID: 26084000
Authors: Maya M. Negev, Shlomit S. Paz, Alexandra A. Clermont, Noemie Groag NG. Pri-Or, Uri U. Shalom, Tamar T. Yeger, Manfred S MS. Green
Abstract: The Mediterranean region is vulnerable to climatic changes. A warming trend exists in the basin with changes in rainfall patterns. It is expected that vector-borne diseases (VBD) in the region will be influenced by climate change since weather conditions influence their emergence. For some diseases (i.e., West Nile virus) the linkage between emergence andclimate change was recently proved; for others (such as dengue) the risk for local transmission is real. Consequently, adaptation and preparation for changing patterns of VBD distribution is crucial in the Mediterranean basin. We analyzed six representative Mediterranean countries and found that they have started to prepare for this threat, but the preparation levels among them differ, and policy mechanisms are limited and basic. Furthermore, cross-border cooperation is not stable and depends on international frameworks. The Mediterranean countries should improve their adaptation plans, and develop more cross-sectoral, multidisciplinary and participatory approaches. In addition, based on experience from existing local networks in advancing national legislation and trans-border cooperation, we outline recommendations for a regional cooperation framework. We suggest that a stable and neutral framework is required, and that it should address the characteristics and needs of African, Asian and European countries around the Mediterranean in order to ensure participation. Such a regional framework is essential to reduce the risk of VBD transmission, since the vectors of infectious diseases know no political borders.


Title #52: Characterization of the Particle Size Fraction associated with Heavy Metals in Suspended Sediments of the Yellow River.
PMID: 26083999
Authors: Qingzhen Q. Yao, Xiaojing X. Wang, Huimin H. Jian, Hongtao H. Chen, Zhigang Z. Yu
Abstract: Variations in the concentrations of particulate heavy metals and fluxes into the sea in the Yellow River were examined based on observational and measured data from January 2009 to December 2010. A custom-built water elutriation apparatus was used to separate suspended sediments into five size fractions. Clay and very fine silt is the dominant fraction in most of the suspended sediments, accounting for >40% of the samples. Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Fe and Mn are slightly affected by anthropogenic activities, while Cd is moderate affected. The concentrations of heavy metals increased with decrease in particle size. For suspended sediments in the Yellow River, on average 78%-82% of the total heavy metal loading accumulated in the <16 Î¼m fraction. About 43% and 53% of heavy metal in 2009 and 2010 respectively, were readily transported to the Bohai Sea with "truly suspended" particles, which have potentially harmful effects on marine organisms.


Title #53: Household Food Expenditure Patterns, Food Nutrient Consumption and Nutritional Vulnerability in Nigeria: Implications for Policy.
PMID: 26083997
Authors: Dare D. Akerele
Abstract: The study examined the patterns of food spending, food nutrient consumption, and nutrient deficiency profiles of households in Nigeria using a cross-sectional nationwide household survey data. Food nutrients were estimated from food expenditure data while the nutrient deficiency profiles were assessed adapting Foster et al. (1984) poverty index. The study established widespread nutritional deficiencies with low-income household cohorts bearing a greater burden of the deficiencies. Protein-protein deficiency appears to be much more prevalent in urban than rural areas. However, the deficiency of micro-nutrients seems to diffuse across urban-rural divides of the country with deficiency of calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C appearing to be more pronounced in rural areas while phosphorous, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, and vitamin B3 deficiencies seem to be higher in urban settings. Pro-poor income growth strategies and sensitively guided urban-rural food and nutrition interventions are advocated for improved food consumption and nutritional deficiency reduction.


Title #54: The consensus sequence of FAMLF alternative splice variants is overexpressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells.
PMID: 26083996
Authors: W L WL. Chen, D F DF. Luo, C. C. Gao, Y. Y. Ding, S Y SY. Wang
Abstract: The familial acute myeloid leukemia related factor gene (FAMLF) was previously identified from a familial AML subtractive cDNA library and shown to undergo alternative splicing. This study used real-time quantitative PCR to investigate the expression of the FAMLF alternative-splicing transcript consensus sequence (FAMLF-CS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 119 patients with de novo acute leukemia (AL) and 104 healthy controls, as well as in CD34+ cells from 12 AL patients and 10 healthy donors. A 429-bp fragment from a novel splicing variant of FAMLF was obtained, and a 363-bp consensus sequence was targeted to quantify total FAMLF expression. Kruskal-Wallis, Nemenyi, Spearman's correlation, and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyze the data. FAMLF-CS expression in PBMCs from AL patients and CD34+ cells from AL patients and controls was significantly higher than in control PBMCs (P<0.0001). Moreover, FAMLF-CS expression in PBMCs from the AML group was positively correlated with red blood cell count (rs =0.317, P=0.006), hemoglobin levels (rs =0.210, P=0.049), and percentage of peripheral blood blasts (rs =0.256, P=0.027), but inversely correlated with hemoglobin levels in the control group (rs =-0.391, P<0.0001). AML patients with high CD34+ expression showed significantly higher FAMLF-CS expression than those with low CD34+ expression (P=0.041). Our results showed that FAMLF is highly expressed in both normal and malignant immature hematopoietic cells, but that expression is lower in normal mature PBMCs.


Title #55: Long-term correlation of the electrocorticogram as a bioindicator of brain exposure to ionizing radiation.
PMID: 26083995
Authors: L A A LA. Aguiar, I M S IM. Silva, T S TS. Fernandes, R A RA. Nogueira
Abstract: Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest. However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG). The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity. Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source. The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the Î±-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation. Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR. In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

Abstract: As an essential trace element, copper can be toxic in mammalian cells when present in excess. Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich proteins that avidly bind copper and thus play an important role in detoxification. Yeast CUP1 is a member of the MT gene family. The aim of this study was to determine whether yeast CUP1 could bind copper effectively and protect cells against copper stress. In this study, CUP1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR, and copper content was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. Cellular viability was detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and the cell cycle distribution of CUP1 was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The data indicated that overexpression of yeast CUP1 in HeLa cells played a protective role against copper-induced stress, leading to increased cellular viability (P<0.05) and decreased ROS production (P<0.05). It was also observed that overexpression of yeast CUP1 reduced the percentage of G1 cells and increased the percentage of S cells, which suggested that it contributed to cell viability. We found that overexpression of yeast CUP1 protected HeLa cells against copper stress. These results offer useful data to elucidate the mechanism of the MT gene on copper metabolism in mammalian cells.


Title #57: Organocatalytic enantioselective formal arylation of azlactones using quinones as the aromatic partner.
PMID: 26083993

Abstract: A new method for the catalytic enantioselective formal arylation of azlactones using quinones as the aromatic partner was developed for the first time. Under mild conditions, the domino Michael/aromatization/cyclization reaction worked well to afford the corresponding products in moderate to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities, some of which have promising cytotoxicity against cancer cells and antibacterial activities.


Title #58: The Active Molybdenum Oxide Phase in the Methanol Oxidation to Formaldehyde (Formox Process): A DFT Study.
PMID: 26083992
Authors: Marcos M. RellÃ¡n-PiÃ±eiro, NÃºria N. LÃ³pez
Abstract: Methanol is oxidised to formaldehyde by the Formox process, in which molybdenum oxides, usually doped with iron, are the catalyst. The active phase of the catalysts and the reasons for the selectivity observed are still unknown. We present a density functional theory based study that indicates the unique character of Mo(VI) ï£¿Mo(IV) pairs as the most active and selective sites and indicates the active sites on the surface, the controlling factors of selectivity, and the role of the dopant. Iron reduces the energy requirements of the redox Mo(VI) ï£¿Mo(IV) pair by acting as an electron reservoir that sets in if required. Our present study paves the way towards a better understanding of the process.


Title #59: Fibrinogen reduction and coagulation in cardiac surgery: an investigational study.

Abstract: Fibrinogen as precursor of fibrin plays an essential role in clot formation. There are three main mechanisms associated with a reduction in fibrinogen concentration during cardiac surgery: hemodilution, consumption, and degradation. Moreover, early fibrinogen degradation products (FgDPs) can interfere with normal fibrin formation of intact fibrinogen. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contributions of hemodilution, consumption, and degradation to fibrinogen loss in cardiac surgery and to evaluate the effects fibrinogen degradation products on blood clot formation in vitro. First, fibrin and fibrinogen concentrations, their degradation products, hematocrit, and albumin concentrations were compared in 10 patients before and after isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Second, ex-vivo fibrinogen supplementation experiments were performed. Finally, the effects of purified FgDPs on clotting time and clot firmness were established in vitro in whole blood by ROTEM. Fibrinogen plasma concentration decreased 30% during surgery. This drop appears to be mainly caused by hemodilution, as both hematocrit and albumin levels decreased and no relevant increase in D-dimer levels and FgDPs was observed. Furthermore, the coagulation profile normalized after addition of purified fibrinogen. Early FgDPs demonstrated a significant impact on in-vitro whole blood clotting. Although early FgDPs have a pronounced effect on blood clot formation in vitro and therefore may induce or enhance in vivo coagulopathy, the drop of fibrinogen concentration seen after CABG surgery (using tranexamic acid) is primarily caused by hemodilution.


Title #60: Influence of P2Y12 polymorphisms on platelet activity but not ex-vivo antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects.

Abstract: Activation of platelet implicated a series of signal conduction including outside-in and inside-out related receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Ticagrelor is the first reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist that exhibits rapid antiplatelet effect. Given that platelet aggregation varies among individuals, genetic polymorphisms in P2Y12 and subsequent signal molecular such as the G-protein beta 3 subunit (GNB3) are supposed to influence the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor. The aim of this study was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in P2Y12 and GNB3 genes influence ex-vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese subjects. A total of 196 healthy Chinese male individuals were recruited. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was determined by using light transmittance aggregometry at baseline and after incubation of the platelet-rich plasma with 15 and 50âÎ¼mol/l ticagrelor, respectively. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P2Y12 and the GNB3 rs5443 polymorphism were genotyped by PCR-direct sequencing. P2Y12 haplotypes were inferred. Baseline platelet aggregation was increased in carriers of the common alleles of P2Y12 SNPs (rs1907637, rs2046934, and rs6809699) and rs6787801 TC heterozygotes (Pâ<â0.05 for all). Results of the haplotype analyses were consistent with those of the single SNPs. Ticagrelor at both concentrations of 15 and 50âÎ¼mol/l decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation significantly (Pâ<â0.05, respectively). Neither single SNPs nor haplotypes of P2Y12 affected ticagrelor-induced ex-vivo inhibition of platelet aggregation. P2Y12 and GNB3 polymorphisms have no effect on the ex-vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects.


Title #61: Thrombophilia diagnosis: a retrospective analysis of a single-center experience.

Abstract: It is estimated that 30-50% of patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) could be diagnosed with congenital or acquired thrombophilia. Its diagnosis, however, rarely changes the clinical management, but is associated with significant costs and negative psychological and social aspects. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of the causes and clinical consequences of diagnostics for thrombophilia. A retrospective review of the medical records of 5600 patients was performed, 62 of whom had, at the time, been diagnosed for thrombophilia because of a thromboembolic event. A review of the current literature on the validity of diagnostic tests for hypercoagulability in certain clinical conditions was also performed. The most common reason for thrombophilia testing was episodes of lower limb DVT (56%). The most frequently diagnosed abnormalities were the heterozygous form of the V Leiden gene (18%), protein S deficiency (11%), and the anti cardiolipin antibody IgG (11%). In 45% of the patients, laboratory results did not confirm the presence of any congenital thrombophilia. After receiving the results, 11% of the respondents completed oral anticoagulation therapy after 3 months, and 28% of patients qualified for indefinite use of oral anticoagulant therapy. In most of the cases examined, the diagnosis of thrombophilia did not significantly affect the treatment. A common aberration identified in patients with a history of thromboembolic incidents was the coexistence of risk factors for atherosclerosis.


Title #62: Is the time in therapeutic range using the ratio of tests equivalent to the Rosendaal method?

Abstract: The percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) is a measure of anticoagulation quality with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The method most commonly used in clinical trials is the Rosendaal TTR. However, the application of this method in daily practice for clinical decision lacks appropriate instruments. We aimed to evaluate the percentage of tests within the target international normalized ratio (INR) (tests ratio) as a surrogate of Rosendaal TTR. We performed an observational and retrospective study to evaluate the TTR according to the Rosendaal method and tests ratio. We included all outpatients who attended the cardiology anticoagulation clinic of a Portuguese hospital (2011-2013), whose target INR was 2.0-3.0. Three hundred and seventy-seven VKA-treated patients followed for a mean 1.3 years were evaluated. Rosendaal methold and tests ratio significantly correlated (Rho Spearman 0.88, Pâ<â0.001), but the Bland-Altman plot evaluation showed a clinically relevant data dispersion [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -12.9 to 23.1] around a mean difference in TTR -5.1% using the tests ratio method. The linear regression Passing-Bablok confirmed the existence of significant data dispersion and systematic differences. The tests ratio less than 60% had a sensitivity of 91.6%, specificity of 72.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 72.2% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.6%, for the diagnosis of patients inadequately anticoagulated (Rosendaal TTR <60%). Tests ratio had a c-statistics of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96). Number of tests in 6 months had a c-statistics of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75). Tests ratio underestimated TTR in 5% and was not considered equivalent to Rosendaal TTR due to the high variability between methods. Nevertheless, the use of tests ratio less than 60% may be a reasonable option to detect inadequate anticoagulation, as it is a sensitive method and excluded most of the patients with adequate control.


Title #63: Influence of posture on routine hemostasis testing.

Abstract: Biological variability is an important aspect for appropriate interpretation of hemostasis testing, but unreliable evidence has been provided to date regarding the effect of different postures on first-line clotting tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen. Variation of APTT, PT and fibrinogen was therefore investigated in 19 healthy volunteers after 25âmin in supine position, 20âmin in sitting position and 20âmin stationary standing in upright position. The change from supine to sitting position caused a significant decrease of PT and a significant increase of fibrinogen. The variation of fibrinogen exceeded the quality specifications for bias. The change from supine to standing position caused a significant bias in all the parameters tested, with a decrease of PT and an increase of fibrinogen that exceeded the quality specifications for bias. The change from sitting to standing position also caused a significant bias in all the parameters tested, but none of these variations was greater than the quality specifications for bias. The results of this investigation show that patient posture may have a significant impact on results of routine hemostasis testing, especially when patient position is changed from supine to standing.


Title #64: Association study of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation with cerebral venous thrombosis in an Iranian population.

Abstract: There are limited data on the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism and hyperhomocysteinemia as risk factors for cerebral venous thrombosis in Iranian population. We examined a possible association between fasting plasma homocysteine levels, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism, and cerebral venous thrombosis in 50 patients with a diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (20-63 years old) and 75 healthy controls (18-65 years old). Genotyping of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T gene polymorphism was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and homocysteine levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Fasting plasma homocysteine levels were significantly higher in cerebral venous thrombosis patients than in controls (Pâ=â0.015). Moreover, plasma homocysteine levels were significantly higher in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype compared to 677CT and 677CC genotypes in both cerebral venous thrombosis patients (Pâ=â0.01) and controls (Pâ=â0.03). Neither 677CT heterozygote genotype [odds ratio (OR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-2.84, Pâ=â0.556] nor 677TT homozygote genotype (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.32-9.21, Pâ=â0.833) was significantly associated with cerebral venous thrombosis. Additionally, no significant differences in the frequency of 677T allele between cerebral venous thrombosis patients and controls were identified (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.69-2.50, Pâ=â0.512). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that elevated plasma homocysteine levels are significant risk factors for cerebral venous thrombosis. Also, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype is not linked with cerebral venous thrombosis, but is a determinant of elevated plasma homocysteine levels.


Title #65: Induction therapy alters plasma fibrin clot properties in multiple myeloma patients: association with thromboembolic complications.

Abstract: Induction therapy in patients with multiple myeloma increases the risk of thromboembolism. We have recently shown that multiple myeloma patients tend to form denser fibrin clots displaying poor lysability. We investigated the effect of induction therapy on fibrin clot properties in multiple myeloma patients. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidity, susceptibility to lysis, thrombin generation, factor VIII and fibrinolytic proteins were compared in 48 multiple myeloma patients prior to and following 3 months of induction therapy, mainly with cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone regimen. Patients on thromboprophylaxis with aspirin or heparins were eligible. A 3-month induction therapy resulted in improved clot properties, that is higher clot permeability, compaction, shorter lag phase and higher final turbidity, along with shorter clot lysis time and higher rate of D-dimer release from fibrin clots than the baseline values. The therapy also resulted in lower thrombin generation, antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), but elevated factor VIII. Progressive disease was associated with lower posttreatment clot permeability and lysability. Despite thromboprophylaxis, two patients developed ischemic stroke and 10 had venous thromboembolism. They were characterized by pretreatment lower clot permeability, prolonged clot lysis time, longer lag phase, higher peak thrombin generation, TAFI and plasminogen activator inhibitor -1. Formation of denser plasma fibrin clots with reduced lysability and increased thrombin generation at baseline could predispose to thrombotic complications during induction treatment in multiple myeloma patients. We observed improved fibrin clot properties and thrombin generation in multiple myeloma patients except those with progressive disease.


Title #66: Novel fibrinogen mutations (AÎ±17GlyâCys and AÎ±381SerâPhe) occurring with a 312ThrâAla polymorphism: allelic phase assigned by direct mass measurement.
PMID: 26083984
Authors: Stephen O SO. Brennan, Andrew D AD. Laurie, Allison A. Mo, Andrew A. Grigg
Abstract: The aim of the study was to determine the molecular cause of dysfibrinogenaemia in a woman with a prolonged thrombin time. Functional fibrinogen abnormalities can be benign or may lead to bleeding or thrombotic conditions. In complex cases, phenotypes may be acquired or involve interplay between several coinherited mutations. The authors developed a new whole-protein time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) approach to direct targeted DNA sequencing of the fibrinogen genes and determine the phase of multiple substitutions in a single individual. TOF MS analysis of the individual's fibrinogen indicated normal BÎ², Î³, and alternately transcribed Î³' chain isoforms, but aberrant AÎ± chain masses. Subsequent fibrinogen AÎ± gene (FGA) sequencing indicated the presence of three different mutations. Two of the substitutions, AÎ±17GlyâCys (at the thrombin cleavage site) and AÎ±381SerâPhe (in the Î±C connector) were novel and the third, AÎ±312ThrâAla, was a known benign polymorphism. Accurate mass measurements of isolated control AÎ± chains showed the predicted AÎ± polypeptide at 66â132âDa and additional phosphorylated species at +â80 and +â160âDa. Patient's AÎ± chains on the other hand had masses of 66â103 and 66â241âDa indicating that she had one 312Ala allele (-30âDa) and one 312Thr allele which carried both the 17GlyâCys (+â46âDa) and 381SerâPhe (+â60)âDa mutations. Cotransmission of these new mutations was confirmed by AÎ± chain TOF MS of plasma fibrinogen and targeted FGA nucleotide sequencing for 10 additional family members.


Title #67: A novel gene insertion combined with a missense mutation causing factor VII deficiency in two unrelated Chinese families.
PMID: 26083983

Abstract: Hereditary coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by reduced FVII activity (FVII:C) and inconsistent FVII antigen (FVII:Ag). In our study, two pregnant probands were diagnosed with FVII deficiency, based on the tests that FVII:C were both 3% and FVII:Ag were less than 7.5%. Gene sequencing revealed the same compound mutations, a recurrent missense mutation p.Arg277Cys and a novel insertion mutation g.11520-11521insT. What is more, haplotype analysis of SNPs excluded the possibility of consanguinity between the two families. According to the model, we speculated that although the insertion mutation was close to the carboxy-terminal, it induced the protein extension and affected the 3' untranslated region of F7 gene, which is significant to posttranscriptional regulation. Hypothetically, the stability or translational efficiency of mRNA may be influenced, resulting in reducing FVII:C.


Title #68: Neonatal onset of congenital factor X deficiency: a description of two novel mutations with 6-year follow-up.
PMID: 26083982
Authors: Iuri I. Corsini, Marzia M. Menegatti, Andrea A. Cairo, Carlo C. Dani
Abstract: Factor X congenital deficiency is a rare coagulation disorder involving autosomal recessive transmission. The clinical situation depends on the extent of the defect and may appear at any age. We report a case of a term newborn who developed a life-threatening bleeding event on the first day of life because of a Factor X (FX) deficiency. Fresh frozen plasma and FX intravenous replacement therapy were administered with normalization of the coagulation test. Genetic analysis identified two novel mutations (c.517G>T; c.139delG) in heterozygous state in the proband that were confirmed in the parents. We also describe a 6-year follow-up during which the patient has been administered prophylactic replacement therapy. The description of these two novel mutations and the long clinical follow-up help to increase our knowledge of the genotype-phenotype correlation of congenital FX deficiency, and provide information on better ways of managing the replacement therapy in patients with similar mutations.


Title #69: Prothrombin G20210A and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphisms in peripheral capillary nonperfusion: a case report.

Abstract: The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene is an established risk factor for venous thrombosis. However, there is some controversy as to the role played by this mutation in arterial thrombotic disease. The association of peripheral capillary nonperfusion with prothrombin G20210A mutation has never been reported before. We present the case of 34-year-old man who presented with peripheral capillary nonperfusion. The fundus examination of his right eye revealed an epiretinal membrane, peripheral (mainly temporally) retinal haemorrhages, exudates and microaneurismal alterations of the vascular bed. Fluorescein angiography of his right eye demonstrated an extended area of capillary nonperfusion distal to the microaneurismal lesions. Evaluation revealed mutations of the G20210A prothrombin and MTHFR genes. Screening for hereditary thrombophilia should be considered, regardless of patient age, in patients with peripheral retinal ischemia. The prothrombin G20210A mutation, a genetic risk factor, may be associated with peripheral capillary nonperfusion.


Title #70: Retardation of Protein Dynamics by Trehalose in Dehydrated Systems of Photosynthetic Reaction Centers. Insights From Electron Transfer and Thermal Denaturation Kinetics.
PMID: 26083980
Authors: Marco M. Malferrari, Francesco F. Francia, Giovanni G. Venturoli
Abstract: Conformational protein dynamics is known to be hampered in amorphous matrices upon dehydration, both in the absence or in the presence of glass forming disaccharides, like trehalose, resulting in enhanced protein thermal stability. To shed light on such matrix effects we have compared the retardation of protein dynamics in photosynthetic bacterial reaction centers (RC) dehydrated at controlled relative humidity in the absence (RC films) or in the presence of trehalose (RC-trehalose glasses). Small scale RC dynamics, associated with the relaxation form the dark-adapted to the light-adapted conformation, have been probed up to the second timescale by analyzing the kinetics of electron transfer from the photoreduced quinone acceptor (QA(-)) to the photoxidized primary donor (P(+)) as a function of the duration of photoexcitation from 7 ns (laser pulse) to 20 s. A more severe inhibition of dynamics is found in RC-trehalose glasses as compared to RC films: only in the latter system a complete relaxation to the light-adapted conformation occurs even at extreme dehydration, although strongly retarded. To gain insight into the large scale RC dynamics up to the timescale of days, the kinetics of thermal denaturation have been studied at 44Â°C by spectral analysis of the Qx and Qy bands of the RC bacteriochlorin cofactors, as a function of the sugar/protein molar ratio, m, varied between 0 and 10(4). Upon increasing m, denaturation is slowed progressively, and above mâ¼500 the RC is stable at least for several days. The stronger retardation of RC relaxation and dynamics induced by trehalose is discussed in the light of a recent molecular dynamics simulation study performed in matrices of the model protein lysozyme with and without trehalose. We suggest that the efficiency of trehalose in retarding RC dynamics and preventing thermal denaturation stems mainly from its propensity to form and stabilize extended networks of hydrogen bonds involving sugar, residual water, and surface residues of the RC complex and from its ability of reducing the free volume fraction of protein alone matrices.


Title #71: Controlled multiple functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles: homogeneous implementation of pairs of functionalities communicating through energy or proton transfers.

Abstract: The synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles bearing organic functionalities is strained by the careful adjustment of the reaction parameters, as the incorporation of functional and/or voluminous organosilanes during the sol-gel synthesis strongly affects the final structure of the nanoparticles. In this paper we describe the design of new clickable mesoporous silica nanoparticles as spheres or rods, synthesized by the co-condensation of TEOS with two clickable organosilanes (bearing alkyne and azide groups) and readily multi-functionalizable by CuAAC click chemistry. We show that controlled loadings of clickable functions can be homogeneously distributed within the MSN, allowing us to efficiently click-graft various pairs of functionalities while preserving the texture and morphology of the particles. The homogeneous distribution of the grafted functionalities was probed by FRET experiments between two anchored fluorophores. Moreover, a communication by proton transfer between two functions was demonstrated by constructing a light-actuated nanomachine that works through a proton transfer between a photoacid generator and a pH-sensitive supramolecular nanogate. The activation of the nanomachine enabled the successful release of rhodamine B in buffered solutions and the delivery of doxorubicin in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) upon blue irradiation.


Title #72: Skyrmion Superfluidity in Two-Dimensional Interacting Fermionic Systems.
PMID: 26083978
Authors: Giandomenico G. Palumbo, Mauro M. Cirio
Abstract: In this article we describe a multi-layered honeycomb lattice model of interacting fermions which supports a new kind of parity-preserving skyrmion superfluidity. We derive the low-energy field theory describing a non-BCS fermionic superfluid phase by means of functional fermionization. Such effective theory is a new kind of non-linear sigma model, which we call double skyrmion model. In the bi-layer case, the quasiparticles of the system (skyrmions) have bosonic statistics and replace the Cooper-pairs role. Moreover, we show that the model is also equivalent to a Maxwell-BF theory, which naturally establishes an effective Meissner effect without requiring a breaking of the gauge symmetry. Finally, we map effective superfluidity effects to identities among fermionic observables for the lattice model. This provides a signature of our theoretical skyrmion superfluidy that can be detected in a possible implementation of the lattice model in a real quantum system.


Title #73: Synthetic applications of hypophosphite derivatives in reduction.

Authors: Carole C. Guyon, Estelle E. MÃ©tay, Florence F. Popowycz, Marc M. Lemaire
Abstract: The development of new tools for the reduction of organic functions to reach high chemo- and stereo-selectivity is an important research domain. Although, aluminum and boron hydrides are commonly used, they suffer from environmentally and safety issues. In particular, at industrial scale, the search for more specific and efficient reagents with a lower ecological impact remains one of the main objectives of organic chemists. This review captures highlights from literature concerning phosphonic and phosphinic acid derivatives as reducing agents and evaluates their potential as alternatives, in particular to boron and aluminum hydrides.


Title #74: Radiological risks of neutron interrogation of food.
PMID: 26083976
Authors: S. S. Albright, R. R. Seviour
Abstract: In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of neutron scanning techniques for security. Neutron techniques with a range of energy spectra including thermal, white and fast neutrons have been shown to work in different scenarios. As international interest in neutron scanning increases the risk of activating cargo, especially foodstuffs must be considered. There has been a limited amount of research into the activation of foods by neutron beams and we have sought to improve the amount of information available. In this paper we show that for three important metrics; activity, ingestion dose and Time to Background there is a strong dependence on the food being irradiated and a weak dependence on the energy of irradiation. Previous studies into activation used results based on irradiation of pharmaceuticals as the basis for research into activation of food. The earlier work reports that [Formula: see text] production is the dominant threat which motivated the search for [Formula: see text]Na[Formula: see text]Na in highly salted foods. We show that [Formula: see text]K can be more significant than [Formula: see text]Na in low sodium foods such as Bananas and Potatoes.


Title #75: Rice microRNA osa-miR1848 targets the obtusifoliol 14Î±-demethylase gene OsCYP51G3 and mediates the biosynthesis of phytosterols and brassinosteroids during development and in response to stress.

Abstract: Phytosterols are membrane components or precursors for brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. As they cannot be transported long distances, their homeostasis is tightly controlled through their biosynthesis and metabolism. However, it is unknown whether microRNAs are involved in their homeostatic regulation. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants transformed with microRNA osa-miR1848 and its target, the obtusifoliol 14Î±-demethylase gene, OsCYP51G3, were used to investigate the role of osa-miR1848 in the regulation of phytosterol biosynthesis. osa-miR1848 directs OsCYP51G3 mRNA cleavage to regulate phytosterol and BR biosynthesis in rice. The role of OsCYP51G3 as one of the osa-miR1848 targets is supported by the opposite expression patterns of osa-miR1848 and OsCYP51G3 in transgenic rice plants, and by the identification of OsCYP51G3 mRNA cleavage sites. Increased osa-miR1848 and decreased OsCYP51G3 expression reduced phytosterol and BR concentrations, and caused typical phenotypic changes related to phytosterol and BR deficiency, including dwarf plants, erect leaves, semi-sterile pollen grains, and shorter cells. Circadian expression of osa-miR1848 regulated the diurnal abundance of OsCYP51G3 transcript in developing organs, and the response of OsCYP51G3 to salt stress. We propose that osa-miR1848 regulates OsCYP51G3 expression posttranscriptionally, and mediates phytosterol and BR biosynthesis. osa-miR1848 and OsCYP51G3 might have potential applications in rice breeding to modulate leaf angle, and the size and quality of seeds.

Abstract: Tyrosinase is an essential copper-containing enzyme required for melanin synthesis. The overproduction and abnormal accumulation of melanin cause hyperpigmentation and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, tyrosinase is promising for use in medicine and cosmetics. Our previous study identified a natural product, A5, resembling the structure of the dipeptide WY and apparently inhibiting tyrosinase. Here, we comprehensively estimated the inhibitory capability of 20 Ã 20 dipeptides against mushroom tyrosinase. We found that cysteine-containing dipeptides, directly blocking the active site of tyrosinase, are highly potent in inhibition; in particular, N-terminal cysteine-containing dipeptides markedly outperform the C-terminal containing ones. The cysteine-containing dipeptides, CE, CS, CY, and CW, show comparative bioactivities, and tyrosine-containing dipeptides are substrate-like inhibitors. The dipeptide PD attenuates 16.5% melanin content without any significant cytotoxicity. This study reveals the functional role of cysteine residue positional preference and the selectivity of specific amino acids in cysteine-containing dipeptides against tyrosinase, aiding in developing skin-whitening products.

Abstract: DNA repair mechanisms are crucial for maintenance of the genome in all organisms, including parasites where successful infection is dependent both on genomic stability and sequence variation. MSH2 is an early acting, central component of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, which is responsible for the recognition and correction of base mismatches that occur during DNA replication and recombination. In addition, recent evidence suggests that MSH2 might also play an important, but poorly understood, role in responding to oxidative damage in both African and American trypanosomes.


Title #79: Amino Acid-Dependent Attenuation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling by Peptide-Gold Nanoparticle Hybrids.

Abstract: Manipulation of immune responsiveness using nano-devices provides a potential approach to treat human diseases. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling plays a central role in the pathophysiology of many acute and chronic human inflammatory diseases, and pharmacological regulation of TLR responses is anticipated to be beneficial in many of these inflammatory conditions. Here we describe the discovery of a unique class of peptide-gold nanoparticle hybrids which exhibit a broad inhibitory activity on TLR signaling, inhibiting signaling through TLRs 2, 3, 4, and 5. As exemplified using TLR4, the nanoparticles were found to inhibit both arms of TLR4 signaling cascade triggered by the prototypical ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through structure-activity relationship studies, we identified the key chemical components of the hybrids that contribute to their immunomodulatory activity. Specifically, the hydrophobicity and aromatic ring structure of the amino acids on the peptides were essential for modulating TLR4 responses. This work enhances our fundamental understanding of the role of nanoparticle surface chemistry in regulating innate immune signaling, and identifies specific nanoparticle hybrids that may represent a unique class of anti-inflammatory therapeutics for human inflammatory diseases.


Title #80: High gastrointestinal permeability and local metabolism of naringenin: influence of antibiotic treatment on absorption and metabolism.
PMID: 26083965

Abstract: The present study aims to determine the permeability of naringenin in the stomach, small intestine and colon, to evaluate intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism, and to study the influence of the microbiota on the absorption and disposition of naringenin (3Â·5Â Î¼g/ml). A single-pass intestinal perfusion model in mice (n 4-6) was used. Perfusate (every 10Â min), blood (at 60Â min) and bile samples were taken and analysed to evaluate the presence of naringenin and its metabolites by an HPLC-MS/MS method. To study the influence of the microbiota on the bioavailability of naringenin, a group of animals received the antibiotic rifaximin (50Â mg/kg per d) for 5Â d, and naringenin permeability was determined in the colon. Naringenin was absorbed well throughout the gastrointestinal tract but mainly in the small intestine and colon (mean permeability coefficient 7Â·80 (sd 1Â·54)Â ÃÂ 10-Â 4cm/s and 5Â·49 (sd 1Â·86)Â ÃÂ 10-Â 4cm/s, respectively), at a level similar to the highly permeable compound, naproxen (6Â·39 (sd 1Â·23)Â ÃÂ 10-Â 4cm/s). According to the high amounts of metabolites found in the perfusate compared to the bile and plasma, naringenin underwent extensive intestinal first-pass metabolism, and the main metabolites excreted were sulfates (84Â·00 (sd 12Â·14)%), followed by glucuronides (8Â·40 (sd 5Â·67)%). Phase II metabolites were found in all perfusates from 5Â min of sampling. Mice treated with rifaximin showed a decrease in naringenin permeability and in the amounts of 4-hydroxyhippuric acid and hippuric acid in the lumen. Naringenin was well absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and its poor bioavailability was due mainly to high intestinal metabolism.

Title #83: Unusual Peroxide-Dependent, Heme-Transforming Reaction Catalyzed by HemQ.
PMID: 26083961
Authors: Arianna I AI. Celis, Bennett R BR. Streit, Garrett C GC. Moraski, Ravi R. Kant, Timothy D TD. Lash, Gudrun S GS. Lukat-Rodgers, Kenton R KR. Rodgers, Jennifer L JL. DuBois
Abstract: A recently proposed pathway for heme b biosynthesis, common to diverse bacteria, has the conversion of two of the four propionates on coproheme III to vinyl groups as its final step. This reaction is catalyzed in a cofactor-independent, H2O2-dependent manner by the enzyme HemQ. Using the HemQ from Staphylococcus aureus (SaHemQ) the initial decarboxylation step was observed to rapidly and obligately yield the three-propionate harderoheme isomer III as the intermediate, while the slower second decarboxylation appeared to control the overall rate. Both synthetic harderoheme isomers III and IV reacted when bound to HemQ, the former more slowly than the latter. While H2O2 is the assumed biological oxidant, either H2O2 or peracetic acid yielded the same intermediates and products, though significantly greater than the expected two equivalents were required in both cases and peracetic acid reacted faster. The ability of peracetic acid to substitute for H2O2 suggests that, despite the lack of catalytic residues conventionally present in heme peroxidase active sites, reaction pathways involving high valent iron intermediates cannot be ruled out.


Title #84: Hamiltonian optics of hyperbolic polaritons in nanogranules.
PMID: 26083960
Authors: Michael M. Fogler, Zhiyuan Z. Sun, Dimitri N DN. Basov, Angel A. Gutierrez-Rubio
Abstract: Semiclassical quantization rules and numerical calculations are applied to study polariton modes of materials whose permittivity tensor has principal values of opposite sign (so-called hyperbolic materials). The spectra of volume- and surface-confined polaritons are computed for spheroidal nanogranules of hexagonal boron nitride, a natural hyperbolic crystal. The field distribution created by polaritons excited by an external dipole source is predicted to exhibit ray-like patterns due to classical periodic orbits. Near-field infrared imaging and Purcell-factor measurements are suggested to test these predictions.

Abstract: Alcohol brief intervention (BI) in primary care (PC) is effective, but remains underutilized despite multiple efforts to increase provider-initiated BI. An alternative approach to promote BI is to prompt patients to initiate alcohol-related discussions. Little is known about the role of patients in BI delivery.


Title #86: Moderators of Varenicline Treatment Effects in a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial for Alcohol Dependence: An Exploratory Analysis.
PMID: 26083958
Authors: Daniel E DE. Falk, I-Jen P IJ. Castle, Megan M. Ryan, Joanne J. Fertig, Raye Z RZ. Litten
Abstract: To explore whether varenicline (Chantix) showed more efficacy in treating certain subgroups of patients. In a recent multisite trial, varenicline was shown to be effective in reducing drinking in alcohol-dependent patients, both smokers and nonsmokers. Given the heterogeneity among alcohol-dependent patients, secondary analyses were conducted to determine whether certain subgroups responded more favorably than others to treatment with varenicline.


Title #87: Co-Occurrence of Substance-Related and Other Mental Health Disorders Among Adolescent Cannabis Users.
PMID: 26083957
Authors: Tauheed T. Zaman, Monica M. Malowney, John J. Knight, J Wesley JW. Boyd
Abstract: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States and is increasingly being legalized throughout the United States. Many believe that cannabis is relatively harmless, and some believe that cannabis is not addictive. We wondered what the rates of cannabis abuse and dependence might be among adolescents referred for substance use evaluations and also about the incidence of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses and substance use disorders among those individuals.

Title #91: Differentiation of Glioma Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells into Local Host Cell-Like Cells: A Study Based on Choroidcarcinoma Differentiation of Choroid Plexus of GFP Transgenic Nude Mouse.
PMID: 26083952
Authors: Zhimin Z. Wang, Xifeng X. Fei, Xinliang X. Dai, Hanchun H. Chen, Haiyan H. Tian, Aidong A. Wang, Jun J. Dong, Qiang Q. Huang
Abstract: The idea of multiple differentiation capacity of glioma stem cells and progentior cells (GSCPs) has been accepted by most of the researchers, but the effect of local environment on the differentiation of GSCPs is unclear. GSCPs SU2 and CM-Dil-stained C6 cells (C6-Dil) were injected into the brain of GFP transgenic nude mice. The xenografts were sectioned. Morphological changes of tumor cells that resided in the choroid plexus, molecular markers expression, and the relationship between the original tumor cells and host cells were studied carefully. The tumorigenicity rate was 40/40 (100%) in all of the inoculated nude mice. Cell morphology and molecular expression of neoplasm settled in the choroid plexus showed that choroidcarcinoma derived from GSCPs was developed. These results showed that GSCPs may have the multiple differentiation capacity, which can be induced by the local environment of host brain as NSCs, and cell fusion may play an important role in the transformation.


Title #92: Integrin Î±vÎ²3 as a Promising Target to Image Neoangiogenesis Using In-House Generator-Produced Positron Emitter (68)Ga-Labeled DOTA-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid (RGD) Ligand.

Abstract: For the growth and spread of a tumor beyond 2âmm, angiogenesis plays a crucial role, and association of various integrins with angiogenesis is evidential. The aim of the study was radiolabeling of DOTA-chelated RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) peptide with (68)Ga for PET imaging in locally advanced breast carcinoma. DOTA-RGD was incubated with (68)GaCl3, eluted in 0.05âm HCl. Elution volume, peptide amount, and reaction pH were studied. Radio-ITLC, gas chromatography, endotoxin, and sterility testing were performed. Serial (n=3) and whole-body (n=2) PET/CT imaging was done on patients post i.v. injection of 111-185âMBq of (68)Ga-DOTA-RGD. Maximum radiolabeling yield was achieved with 3âmL elution volume of 15-20âÎ¼g peptide at pH 3.5-4.0 with 10 minutes of incubation at 95Â°C. Product samples were sterile having 99.5% radiochemical purity with residual ethanol content and endotoxins in injectable limits. Intense radiotracer uptake was noticed in the tumor with SUVmax 15.3 at 45 minutes in serial images. Physiological radiotracer uptake was seen in the liver, spleen, ventricles, and thyroid with excretion through the kidneys. The authors concluded that (68)Ga-DOTA-RGD has the potential for imaging Î±,vÎ²3 integrin-expressing tumors.


Title #93: Dendritic Versus Tumor Cell Presentation of Autologous Tumor Antigens for Active Specific Immunotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma: Impact on Long-Term Survival by Extent of Disease at the Time of Treatment.
PMID: 26083950

Abstract: In patients with metastatic melanoma, sequential single-arm and randomized phase II trials with a therapeutic vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with antigens from self-renewing, proliferating, irradiated autologous tumor cells (DC-TC) showed superior survival compared with similar patients immunized with irradiated tumor cells (TC). We wished to determine whether this difference was evident in cohorts who at the time of treatment had (1) no evidence of disease (NED) or (2) had detectable disease. Eligibility criteria and treatment schedules were the same for all three trials. Pooled data confirmed that overall survival (OS) was longer in 72 patients treated with DC-TC compared with 71 patients treated with TC (median OS 60 versus 22 months; 5-year OS 51% versus 32%, p=0.004). Treatment with DC-TC was associated with longer OS in both cohorts. Among 70 patients who were NED at the time that treatment was started, OS was better for DC-TC: 5-year OS 73% versus 43% (p=0.015). Among 73 patients who had detectable metastases, OS was better for DC-TC: median 38.8 months versus 14.7 months, 5-year OS 33% versus 20% (p=0.025). This approach is promising as an adjunct to other therapies in patients who have had metastatic melanoma.


Title #94: Porphyrin Sensitizers Bearing a Pyridine-Type Anchoring Group for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells.
PMID: 26083949
Authors: Chi-Lun CL. Mai, Thomas T. Moehl, Chi-Hung CH. Hsieh, Jean-David JD. Decoppet, Shaik M SM. Zakeeruddin, Michael M. GrÃ¤tzel, Chen-Yu CY. Yeh
Abstract: Three novel efficient donor-acceptor porphyrins MH1-MH3 with a pyridine-type acceptor and anchoring group were synthesized and their optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties investigated. Replacing the commonly used 4-carboxyphenyl anchoring group with 2-carboxypyridine, 2-pyridone, and pyridine did not significantly change the absorption and electrochemical properties of the porphyrin dyes. These new porphyrin dyes MH show power conversion efficiencies of 8.3%, 8.5%, and 8.2%, which are comparable to that of the benchmark YD2-o-C8 (Î· = 8.25%) under similar conditions. It was demonstrated that 2-carboxypyridine is an efficient and stable anchoring group as MH1 showed better cell performance and long-term stability than YD2-o-C8 under light soaking conditions.


Title #95: Aspirin desensitization for patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease: A randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial.

Abstract: The effect of aspirin desensitization (AD) on immunologic profile of patients with AERD has been poorly understood. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of AD on clinical and immunological markers of patients with AERD. This randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial comprised of 34 adult patients (67.6% female) with chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps and aspirin intolerant asthma. Active group underwent AD over a 2-day period with increasing doses of aspirin (60, 125, 325 and 625 mg), followed by receiving aspirin 625 mg twice daily for 6 months. Symptom scores and medication needs of patients with AERD undergone AD were significantly lower compared to placebo group after 6 months (7.5Â±3.5 vs. 10.6Â±3.8 and 9.3Â± 2.0 vs. 11.0Â±3.1, respectively, all p<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in serum concentration of IL-10, IFN-Î³ and TGF-Î² between two groups neither at baseline nor at the end of study.


Title #96: Phasic Treatment with Interferon Gamma Stimulates Release of Exosomes that Protect Against Spreading Depression.
PMID: 26083947
Authors: Aya D AD. Pusic, Richard P RP. Kraig
Abstract: The detrimental effects of T-cell-secreted interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) on oxidative stress (OS) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well recognized. Recently, we demonstrated that IFNÎ³-mediated damage to myelin also increases susceptibility to spreading depression (SD; the likely basis of migraine with aura). However, before onset of MS, induction of physiological levels of IFNÎ³, like that produced by environmental enrichment (EE), protects against demyelination and OS. Accordingly, we focused on the potential for physiological levels of IFNÎ³ to protect against SD. EE, which occurs with a moderate and phasic increase in proinflammatory cytokines, reduces migraine frequency. Thus, we applied phasic or pulsed IFNÎ³ to brain slice cultures to emulate EE. This treatment reduced OS, increased myelin basic protein, a marker for myelin, and reduced susceptibility to SD. Building on our research on exosomes in EE-based neuroprotection, we found that IFNÎ³ stimulation of slice cultures induced release of exosomes, likely from the microglia that produce the same protective effects as IFNÎ³ treatment when applied to naive cultures. Finally, nasal administration of IFNÎ³ to rats recapitulated in vitro effects, reducing OS, increasing myelin, and reducing SD. These results support phasic IFNÎ³ signaling as a therapeutic target for prevention of SD and, by extension, migraine.


Title #97: Enhanced deposition by electrostatic field-assistance aggravates diesel exhaust aerosol toxicity for human lung cells.

Abstract: Air pollution is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, but conventional air quality monitoring gives no information about biological consequences. Exposing human lung cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to ambient aerosol could help identify acute biological responses. This study investigated electrode-assisted deposition of diesel exhaust aerosol (DEA) on human lung epithelial cells (A549) in a prototype exposure chamber. A549 cells were exposed to DEA at the ALI and under submerged conditions in different electrostatic fields (EFs) and were assessed for cell viability, membrane integrity and IL-8 secretion. Qualitative differences of the DEA and its deposition under different EFs were characterized using scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Upon exposure to DEA only, cell viability decreased and membrane impairment increased for cells at the ALI; submerged cells were unaffected. These responses were enhanced upon application of an EF, as was DEA deposition. No adverse effects were observed for filtered DEA or air only, confirming particle-induced responses. The prototype exposure chamber proved suitable for testing DEA-induced biological responses of cells at the ALI using electrode-assisted deposition and may be useful for analysis of other air pollutants.


Title #98: Problems in the regulatory policy of the drug market.
PMID: 26083945
Authors: NathÃ¡lia Molleis NM. Miziara, Diogo Rosenthal DR. Coutinho
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Analyze the implementation of drug price regulation policy by the Drug Market Regulation Chamber. METHODS This is an interview-based study, which was undertaken in 2012, using semi-structured questionnaires with social actors from the pharmaceutical market, the pharmaceuticals industry, consumers and the regulatory agency. In addition, drug prices were compiled based on surveys conducted in the state of Sao Paulo, at the point of sale, between February 2009 and May 2012. RESULTS The mean drug prices charged at the point of sale (pharmacies) were well below the maximum price to the consumer, compared with many drugs sold in Brazil. Between 2009 and 2012, 44 of the 129 prices, corresponding to 99 drugs listed in the database of compiled prices, showed a variation of more than 20.0% in the mean prices at the point of sale and the maximum price to the consumer. In addition, many laboratories have refused to apply the price adequacy coefficient in their sales to government agencies. CONCLUSIONS The regulation implemented by the pharmaceutical market regulator was unable to significantly control prices of marketed drugs, without succeeding to push them to levels lower than those determined by the pharmaceutical industry and failing, therefore, in its objective to promote pharmaceutical support for the public. It is necessary reconstruct the regulatory law to allow market prices to be reduced by the regulator as well as institutional strengthen this government body.


Title #99: Prevalence of self-medication in the adult population of Brazil: a systematic review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence of self-medication in Brazil's adult population. METHODS Systematic review of cross-sectional population-based studies. The following databases were used: Medline, Embase, Scopus, ISI, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, CRD, Lilacs, SciELO, the Banco de teses brasileiras (Brazilian theses database) (Capes) and files from the Portal DomÃ­nio PÃºblico (Brazilian Public Domain). In addition, the reference lists from relevant studies were examined to identify potentially eligible articles. There were no applied restrictions in terms of the publication date, language or publication status. Data related to publication, population, methods and prevalence of self-medication were extracted by three independent researchers. Methodological quality was assessed following eight criteria related to sampling, measurement and presentation of results. The prevalences were measured from participants who used at least one medication during the recall period of the studies. RESULTS The literature screening identified 2,778 records, from which 12 were included for analysis. Most studies were conducted in the Southeastern region of Brazil, after 2000 and with a 15-day recall period. Only five studies achieved high methodological quality, of which one study had a 7-day recall period, in which the prevalence of self-medication was 22.9% (95%CI 14.6;33.9). The prevalence of self-medication in three studies of high methodological quality with a 15-day recall period was 35.0% (95%CI 29.0;40.0, I2 = 83.9%) in the adult Brazilian population. CONCLUSIONS Despite differences in the methodologies of the included studies, the results of this systematic review indicate that a significant proportion of the adult Brazilian population self-medicates. It is suggested that future research projects that assess self-medication in Brazil standardize their methods.


Title #100: Incidence and predicting factors of falls of older inpatients.
PMID: 26083943

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To estimate the incidence and predicting factors associated with falls among older inpatients. METHODS Prospective cohort study conducted in clinical units of three hospitals in Cuiaba, MT, Midwestern Brazil, from March to August 2013. In this study, 221 inpatients aged 60 or over were followed until hospital discharge, death, or fall. The method of incidence density was used to calculate incidence rates. Bivariate analysis was performed by Chi-square test, and multiple analysis was performed by Cox regression. RESULTS The incidence of falls was 12.6 per 1,000 patients/day. Predicting factors for falls during hospitalization were: low educational level (RR = 2.48; 95%CI 1.17;5.25), polypharmacy (RR = 4.42; 95%CI 1.77;11.05), visual impairment (RR = 2.06; 95%CI 1.01;4.23), gait and balance impairment (RR = 2.95; 95%CI 1.22;7.14), urinary incontinence (RR = 5.67; 95%CI 2.58;12.44) and use of laxatives (RR = 4.21; 95%CI 1.15;15.39) and antipsychotics (RR = 4.10; 95%CI 1.38;12.13). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of falls of older inpatients is high. Predicting factors found for falls were low education level, polypharmacy, visual impairment, gait and balance impairment, urinary incontinence and use of laxatives and antipsychotics. Measures to prevent falls in hospitals are needed to reduce the incidence of this event.


Title #101: Economic crisis and counter-reform of universal health care systems: Spanish case.
PMID: 26083942
Authors: Paulo AntÃ´nio de Carvalho PA. Fortes, Regina Ribeiro Parizi RR. Carvalho, MarÃ­lia Cristina Prado MC. Louvison
Abstract: The economic crisis that has been affecting Europe in the 21st century has modified social protection systems in the countries that adopted, in the 20th century, universal health care system models, such as Spain. This communication presents some recent transformations, which were caused by changes in Spanish law. Those changes relate to the access to health care services, mainly in regards to the provision of care to foreigners, to financial contribution from users for health care services, and to pharmaceutical assistance. In crisis situations, reforms are observed to follow a trend which restricts rights and deepens social inequalities.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To analyze the association between unintended pregnancy and postpartum depression. METHODS This is a prospective cohort study conducted with 1,121 pregnant aged 18 to 49 years, who attended the prenatal program devised by the Brazilian Family Health Strategy, Recife, PE, Northeastern Brazil, between July 2005 and December 2006. We interviewed 1,121 women during pregnancy and 1,057 after childbirth. Unintended pregnancy was evaluated during the first interview and postpartum depression symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screening Scale. The crude and adjusted odds ratios for the studied association were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The frequency for unintended pregnancy was 60.2%; 25.9% presented postpartum depression symptoms. Those who had unintended pregnancies had a higher likelihood of presenting this symptoms, even after adjusting for confounding variables (OR = 1.48; 95%CI 1.09;2.01). When the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) variable was included, the association decreased, however, remained statistically significant (OR = 1.42; 95%CI 1.03;1.97). CONCLUSIONS Unintended pregnancy showed association with subsequent postpartum depressive symptoms. This suggests that high values in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screening Scale may result from unintended pregnancy.


Title #103: Characterization of D-xylonate dehydratase YjhG from Escherichia coli.

Abstract: D-xylonate dehydratase YjhG from Escherichia coli can convert D-xylonate into 2-keto-3-deoxy- D-xylonate (KDX), and is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of 1,2,4-butanetriol and other chemicals. However, the biochemical properties of YjhG still remain unknown. In this study, the activity assay method for YjhG was established based on semicarbazide method, in which KDX reacts with semicarbazide reagent, and is further quantified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The effect of reaction conditions on YjhG activity was determined in vitro using purified His-tagged YjhG protein. This enzyme showed maximal activity at 30 Â°C and pH 8.0. Bivalent metal ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) activated, whereas Ni(2+) and Zn(2+) inhibited the activity of YjhG. Under optimal conditions, the Km and Vmax values were 4.88Â mM and 78.62Â Î¼M l(-1)h(-1), respectively, when using D-xylonate as a substrate. Amino acids sequence alignments and catalytic properties analysis revealed that YjhG might be a member of IlvD/EDD family. Results obtained in this study may lay a foundation for further investigation on YjhG and will benefit its application in biosynthesis of related chemicals.


Title #104: The microtubule nucleation activity of centrobin in both the centrosome and cytoplasm.
PMID: 26083938
Authors: Wonjung W. Shin, Nam-Kyung NK. Yu, Bong-Kiun BK. Kaang, Kunsoo K. Rhee
Abstract: Centrobin resides in daughter centriole and play a critical role in centriole duplication. Nucleation and stabilization of microtubules are known biological activities of centrobin. Here, we report a specific localization of centrobin outside the centrosome. Centrobin was associated with the stable microtubules. In hippocampal cells, centrobin formed cytoplasmic dots in addition to the localization at both centrosomes with the mother and daughter centrioles. Such specific localization pattern suggests that cytoplasmic centrobin is not just a reserved pool for centrosomal localization but also has a specific role in the cytoplasm. In fact, centrobin enhanced microtubule formation outside as well as inside the centrosome. These results propose specific roles of the cytoplasmic centrobin for noncentrosomal microtubule formation in specific cell types and during the cell cycle.


Title #105: FANCD2 influences replication fork processes and genome stability in response to clustered DSBs.

Abstract: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition syndrome and the factors defective in FA are involved in DNA replication, DNA damage repair and tumor suppression. Here, we show that FANCD2 is critical for genome stability maintenance in response to high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. We found that FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated and recruited to the sites of clustered DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) specifically in S/G2 cells after high-LET radiation. Further, FANCD2 facilitated the repair of clustered DSBs in S/G2 cells and proper progression of S-phase. Furthermore, lack of FANCD2 led to a reduced rate of replication fork progression and elevated levels of both replication fork stalling and new origin firing in response to high-LET radiation. Mechanistically, FANCD2 is required for correct recruitment of RPA2 and Rad51 to the sites of clustered DSBs and that is critical for proper processing of clustered DSBs. Significantly, FANCD2-decifient cells exhibited defective chromosome segregation, elevated levels of chromosomal aberrations, and anchorage-independent growth in response to high-LET radiation. These findings establish FANCD2 as a key factor in genome stability maintenance in response to high-LET radiation and as a promising target to improve cancer therapy.


Title #106: Exploring the Mechanisms of Gastrointestinal Cancer Development Using Deep Sequencing Analysis.
PMID: 26083936
Authors: Tomonori T. Matsumoto, Takahiro T. Shimizu, Atsushi A. Takai, Hiroyuki H. Marusawa
Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized cancer genomics due to their high throughput sequencing capacity. Reports of the gene mutation profiles of various cancers by many researchers, including international cancer genome research consortia, have increased over recent years. In addition to detecting somatic mutations in tumor cells, NGS technologies enable us to approach the subject of carcinogenic mechanisms from new perspectives. Deep sequencing, a method of optimizing the high throughput capacity of NGS technologies, allows for the detection of genetic aberrations in small subsets of premalignant and/or tumor cells in noncancerous chronically inflamed tissues. Genome-wide NGS data also make it possible to clarify the mutational signatures of each cancer tissue by identifying the precise pattern of nucleotide alterations in the cancer genome, providing new information regarding the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this review, we highlight these new methods taking advantage of NGS technologies, and discuss our current understanding of carcinogenic mechanisms elucidated from such approaches.


Title #107: Involvement of 14-3-3 Proteins in Regulating Tumor Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PMID: 26083935
Authors: Yi-Ju YJ. Wu, Yee-Jee YJ. Jan, Bor-Sheng BS. Ko, Shu-Man SM. Liang, Jun-Yang JY. Liou
Abstract: There are seven mammalian isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein, which regulate multiple cellular functions via interactions with phosphorylated partners. Increased expression of 14-3-3 proteins contributes to tumor progression of various malignancies. Several isoforms of 14-3-3 are overexpressed and associate with higher metastatic risks and poorer survival rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 14-3-3Î² and 14-3-3Î¶ regulate HCC cell proliferation, tumor growth and chemosensitivity via modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signal pathways. Moreover, 14-3-3Îµ suppresses E-cadherin and induces focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression, thereby enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HCC cell migration. 14-3-3Î¶ forms complexes with Î±B-crystallin, which induces EMT and is the cause of sorafenib resistance in HCC. Finally, a recent study has indicated that 14-3-3Ï induces heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression, which increases HCC cell migration. These results suggest that selective 14-3-3 isoforms contribute to cell proliferation, EMT and cell migration of HCC by regulating distinct targets and signal pathways. Targeting 14-3-3 proteins together with specific downstream effectors therefore has potential to be therapeutic and prognostic factors of HCC. In this article, we will overview 14-3-3's regulation of its downstream factors and contributions to HCC EMT, cell migration and proliferation.


Title #108: Sarcoidosis in Melanoma Patients: Case Report and Literature Review.
PMID: 26083934
Authors: Bryce D BD. Beutler, Philip R PR. Cohen
Abstract: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the development of noncaseating granulomas in multiple organ systems. Many hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including melanoma, have been associated with sarcoidosis. We describe the clinical and pathologic findings of a 54-year-old man with melanoma-associated sarcoidosis. In addition, we not only review the literature describing characteristics of other melanoma patients with sarcoidosis, but also the features of melanoma patients with antineoplastic therapy-associated sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis has been described in 80 melanoma patients; sufficient information for analysis was provided in 39 of these individuals. In 43.6% of individuals (17 out of 39), sarcoidosis was directly associated with melanoma; in 56.4% of oncologic patients (22 out of 39), sarcoidosis was induced by antineoplastic therapy that had been administered for the treatment of their metastatic melanoma. The discovery of melanoma preceded the development of sarcoidosis in 12 of the 17 (70.5%) individuals who did not receive systemic treatment. Pulmonary and/or cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis were common among both groups of patients. Most patients did not require treatment for sarcoidosis. Melanoma patients-either following antineoplastic therapy or without systemic treatment-may be at an increased risk to develop sarcoidosis. In antineoplastic therapy naive melanoma patients, a common etiologic factor-such as exposure to ultraviolet light-may play a role in their developing melanoma and sarcoidosis.


Title #109: Complications from Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer.
PMID: 26083933
Authors: Kylie H KH. Kang, Christian C CC. Okoye, Ravi B RB. Patel, Shankar S. Siva, Tithi T. Biswas, Rodney J RJ. Ellis, Min M. Yao, Mitchell M. Machtay, Simon S SS. Lo
Abstract: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has become a standard treatment option for early stage, node negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who are either medically inoperable or refuse surgical resection. SBRT has high local control rates and a favorable toxicity profile relative to other surgical and non-surgical approaches. Given the excellent tumor control rates and increasing utilization of SBRT, recent efforts have focused on limiting toxicity while expanding treatment to increasingly complex patients. We review toxicities from SBRT for lung cancer, including central airway, esophageal, vascular (e.g., aorta), lung parenchyma (e.g., radiation pneumonitis), and chest wall toxicities, as well as radiation-induced neuropathies (e.g., brachial plexus, vagus nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve). We summarize patient-related, tumor-related, dosimetric characteristics of these toxicities, review published dose constraints, and propose strategies to reduce such complications.


Title #110: Self-interconnecting Pt nanowire network electrode for electrochemical amperometric biosensor.
PMID: 26083932
Authors: Shuqi S. Wang, Li-Ping LP. Xu, Hai-Wei HW. Liang, Shu-Hong SH. Yu, Yongqiang Y. Wen, Shutao S. Wang, Xueji X. Zhang
Abstract: One-dimensional Pt nanostructures are of considerable interest for the development of highly stable and sensitive electrochemical sensors. This paper describes a self-interconnecting Pt nanowire network electrode (PtNNE) for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose with ultrahigh sensitivity and stability. The as-prepared PtNNE consists of polycrystalline nanowires with high-index facets along the side surface which provides more active surface atoms on kinks and steps, those ultralong nanowires being interconnected with each other to form a free-standing network membrane. The excellent structural features of the PtNNE promoted its performance as a Pt-based electrochemical sensor both in terms of electrocatalytic activity and stability. Amperometric measurements towards hydrogen peroxide were performed; the PtNNE sensor showed an extremely high sensitivity of 1360 Î¼A mM(-1) cm(-2). This excellent sensitivity is mainly attributed to the high-index facets of the nanowires resulting in their superior electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2, and the interconnected nanowire network forming an "electron freeway" transport model, which could provide multiple electron pathways and fast electron transport on the electrode, leading to rapid reaction and sensitive signal detection. The as-prepared PtNNE also holds promise as an oxidase-based biosensor. As a proof of concept, a PtNNE-based glucose biosensor also showed an outstanding sensitivity as high as 114 Î¼A mM(-1) cm(-2), a low detection limit of 1.5 Î¼M, and an impressive detection range from 5 Î¼M to 30 mM.


Title #111: Spatial Control of Biochemical Modification Cascades and Pathways.
PMID: 26083931
Authors: Aiman A. Alam-Nazki, J. J. Krishnan
Abstract: Information transmission in cells occurs through complex networks of proteins and genes and is relayed throughÂ cascades of biochemical modifications, which are typically studied through ordinary differential equations. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that spatial factors can strongly influence chemical information transmission in cells. In this article, we systematically disentangle the effects of space in signaling cascades. This is done by examining the effects of localization/compartmentalization and diffusion of enzymes and substrates in multiple variants of chemical modification cascades. This includes situations where the modified form of species at one stage 1) acts as an enzyme for the next stage; 2) acts as a substrate for the next stage; and 3) is involved in phosphotransfer. Our analysis reveals the multiple effects of space in signal transduction cascades. Although in some cases space plays a modulatory effect (itself of interest), in other cases, spatial regulation and control can profoundly affect the nature of information processing as a result of the subtle interplay between the patterns of localization of species, diffusion, and the nature of the modification cascades. Our results provide a platform for disentangling the role of space and spatial control in multiple cellular contexts and a basis for engineering spatial control in signaling cascades through localization/compartmentalization.


Title #112: Dominant Driving Forces in Human Telomere Quadruplex Binding-Induced Structural Alterations.

Abstract: Recently various pathways of human telomere (ht) DNA folding into G-quadruplexes and of ligand binding to these structures have been proposed. However, the key issue as to the nature of forces driving the folding and recognition processes remains unanswered. In this study, structural changes of 22-mer ht-DNA fragment (Tel22), induced by binding of ions (K(+), Na(+)) and specific bisquinolinium ligands, were monitored by calorimetric and spectroscopic methods and by gel electrophoresis. Using the global model analysis of a wide variety of experimental data, we were able to characterize the thermodynamic forces that govern the formation of stable Tel22 G-quadruplexes, folding intermediates, and ligand-quadruplex complexes, and then predict Tel22 behavior in aqueous solutions as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and ligand concentration. On the basis of the above, we believe that our work sets the framework for better understanding the heterogeneity of ht-DNA folding and binding pathways, and its structural polymorphism.


Title #113: Structural and Thermodynamic Properties of Septin 3 Investigated by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering.

Abstract: Septins comprise a family of proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes and related to several human pathologies. They are constituted by three structural domains: the N- and C-terminal domains, highly variable in length and composition, and the central domain, involved in the guanine nucleotide (GTP) binding. Thirteen different human septins are known to form heterogeneous complexes or homofilaments, which are stabilized by specific interactions between the different interfaces present in the domains. In this work, we have investigated by in-solution small-angle x-ray scattering the structural and thermodynamic properties of a human septin 3 construct, SEPT3-GC, which contains both of both interfaces (G and NC) responsible for septin-septin interactions. In order to shed light on the role of these interactions, small-angle x-ray scattering measurements were performed in a wide range of temperatures, from 2 up to 56Â°C, both with and without a nonhydrolysable form of GTP (GTPÎ³S). The acquired data show a temperature-dependent coexistence of monomers, dimers, and higher-order aggregates that were analyzed using a global fitting approach, taking into account the crystallographic structure of the recently reported SEPT3 dimer, PDB:3SOP. As a result, the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity variations that control the dimer-monomer dissociation equilibrium in solution were derived and GTPÎ³S was detected to increase the enthalpic stability of the dimeric species. Moreover, a temperature increase was observed to induce dissociation of SEPT3-GC dimers into monomers just preceding their reassembling into amyloid aggregates, as revealed by the Thioflavin-T fluorescence assays.


Title #114: Determining the Locations of Ions and Water around DNA from X-Ray Scattering Measurements.
PMID: 26083928
Authors: Steve P SP. Meisburger, Suzette A SA. Pabit, Lois L. Pollack
Abstract: Nucleic acids carry a negative charge, attracting salt ions and water. Interactions with these components of the solvent drive DNA to condense, RNA to fold, and proteins to bind. To understand these biological processes, knowledge of solvent structure around the nucleic acids is critical. Yet, because they are often disordered, ions and water evade detection by x-ray crystallography and other high-resolution methods. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) is uniquely sensitive to the spatial correlations between solutes and the surrounding solvent. Thus, SAXS provides an experimental constraint to guide or test emerging solvation theories. However, the interpretation of SAXS profiles is nontrivial because of the difficulty in separating the scattering signals of each component: the macromolecule, ions, and hydration water. Here, we demonstrate methods for robustly deconvoluting these signals, facilitating a more straightforward comparison with theory. Using SAXS data collected on an absolute intensity scale for short DNA duplexes in solution with Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), or Cs(+) counterions, we mathematically decompose the scattering profiles into components (DNA, water, and ions) and validate the decomposition using anomalous scattering measurements. In addition, we generate a library of physically motivated ion atmosphere models and rank them by agreement with the scattering data. The best-fit models have relatively compact ion atmospheres when compared to predictions from the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory of electrostatics. Thus, the x-ray scattering methods presented here provide a valuable measurement of the global structure of the ion atmosphere that can be used to test electrostatics theories that go beyond the mean-field approximation.


Title #115: Slowdown of Interhelical Motions Induces a Glass Transition in RNA.
PMID: 26083927
Authors: Aaron T AT. Frank, Qi Q. Zhang, Hashim M HM. Al-Hashimi, Ioan I. Andricioaei
Abstract: RNA function depends crucially on the details of its dynamics. The simplest RNA dynamical unit is a two-way interhelical junction. Here, for such a unit-the transactivation response RNA element-we present evidence from molecular dynamics simulations, supported by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments, for a dynamical transition near 230Â K. This glass transition arises from the freezing out of collective interhelical motional modes. The motions, resolved withÂ site-specificity, are dynamically heterogeneous and exhibit non-Arrhenius relaxation. The microscopic origin of the glass transition is a low-dimensional, slow manifold consisting largely of the Euler angles describing interhelical reorientation. Principal component analysis over a range of temperatures covering the glass transition shows that the abrupt slowdown of motion finds its explanation in a localization transition that traps probability density into several disconnected conformational pools over the low-dimensional energy landscape. Upon temperature increase, the probability density pools then flood a larger basin, akin to a lakes-to-sea transition. Simulations on transactivation response RNA are also used to backcalculate inelastic neutron scattering data that match previous inelastic neutron scattering measurements on larger and more complex RNA structures and which, upon normalization, give temperature-dependent fluctuation profiles that overlap onto a glass transition curve that is quasi-universal over a range of systems and techniques.


Title #116: Nanoscale Pulling of Type IV Pili Reveals Their Flexibility and Adhesion to Surfaces over Extended Lengths of the Pili.
PMID: 26083926
Authors: Shun S. Lu, Maximiliano M. Giuliani, Hanjeong H. Harvey, Lori L LL. Burrows, Robert A RA. Wickham, John R JR. Dutcher
Abstract: Type IV pili (T4P) are very thin protein filaments that extend from and retract into bacterial cells, allowing them to interact with and colonize a broad array of chemically diverse surfaces. The physical aspects that allow T4P to mediate adherence to many different surfaces remain unclear. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoscale pulling experiments were used to measure the mechanical properties of T4P of a mutant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 unable to retract its T4P. After adhering bacteria to the end of an AFM cantilever and approaching surfaces of mica, gold, or polystyrene, we observed adhesion of the T4P to all of the surfaces. Pulling of single and multiple T4P on retraction of the cantilever from the surfaces could be described using the worm-like chain (WLC) model. Distinct peaks in the measured distributions of the best-fit values of the persistence length Lp on two different surfaces provide strong evidence for close-packed bundling of very flexible T4P. In addition, we observed force plateaus indicating that adhesion of the T4P to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces occurs along extended lengths of the T4P. These data shed new light, to our knowledge, on T4P flexibility and support a low-affinity, high-avidity adhesion mechanism that mediates bacteria-surface interactions.


Title #117: A Temperature-Jump Optical Trap for Single-Molecule Manipulation.
PMID: 26083925
Authors: Sara S. de Lorenzo, Marco M. Ribezzi-Crivellari, J Ricardo JR. Arias-Gonzalez, Steven B SB. Smith, Felix F. Ritort
Abstract: To our knowledge, we have developed a novel temperature-jump optical tweezers setup that changes the temperature locally and rapidly. It uses a heating laser with a wavelength that is highly absorbed by water so it can cover a broad range of temperatures. This instrument can record several force-distance curves for one individual molecule at various temperatures with good thermal and mechanical stability. Our design has features to reduce convection and baseline shifts, which have troubled previous heating-laser instruments. As proof of accuracy, we used the instrument to carry out DNA unzipping experiments in which we derived the average basepair free energy, entropy, and enthalpy of formation of the DNA duplex in a range of temperatures between 5Â°C and 50Â°C. We also used the instrument to characterize the temperature-dependent elasticity of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where we find a significant condensation plateau at low force and low temperature. Oddly, the persistence length of ssDNA measured at high force seems to increase with temperature, contrary to simple entropic models.


Title #118: X-Ray Fiber Diffraction Recordings from Oriented Demembranated Chlamydomonas Flagellar Axonemes.
PMID: 26083924
Authors: Shiori S. Toba, Hiroyuki H. Iwamoto, Shinji S. Kamimura, Kazuhiro K. Oiwa
Abstract: The high homology of its axonemal components with humans and a large repertoire of axonemal mutants make Chlamydomonas a useful model system for experiments on the structure and function of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Using this organism, we explored the spatial arrangement of axonemal components under physiological conditions by small-angle x-ray fiber diffraction. Axonemes were oriented in physiological solution by continuous shear flow and exposed to intense and stable x rays generated in the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8, BL45XU. We compared diffraction patterns from axonemes isolated from wild-type and mutant strains lacking the whole outer arm (oda1), radial spoke (pf14), central apparatus (pf18), or the Î±-chain of the outer arm dynein (oda11). Diffraction of the axonemes showed a series of well-defined meridional/layer-line and equatorial reflections. Diffraction patterns from mutant axonemes exhibited a systematic loss/attenuation of meridional/layer-line reflections, making it possible to determine the origin of various reflections. The 1/24 and 1/12Â nm(-1) meridional reflections of oda1 and oda11 were much weaker than those of the wild-type, suggesting that the outer dynein arms are the main contributor to these reflections. The weaker 1/32 and 1/13.7Â nm(-1) meridional reflections from pf14 compared with the wild-type suggest that these reflections come mainly from the radial spokes. The limited contribution of the central pair apparatus to the diffraction patterns was confirmed by the similarity between the patterns of the wild-type and pf18. The equatorial reflections were complex, but a comparison with electron micrograph-based models allowed the density of each axonemal component to be estimated. Addition of ATP to rigor-state axonemes also resulted in subtle changes in equatorial intensity profiles, which could report nucleotide-dependent structural changes of the dynein arms. The first detailed description of axonemal reflections presented here serves as a landmark for further x-ray diffraction studies to monitor the action of constituent proteins in functional axonemes.


Title #119: Bending Rigidities and Interdomain Forces in Membranes with Coexisting Lipid Domains.
PMID: 26083923
Authors: Benjamin B. Kollmitzer, Peter P. Heftberger, Rudolf R. Podgornik, John F JF. Nagle, Georg G. Pabst
Abstract: To precisely quantify the fundamental interactions between heterogeneous lipid membranes with coexisting liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains, we performed detailed osmotic stress small-angle x-ray scattering experiments by exploiting the domain alignment in raft-mimicking lipid multibilayers. Performing a Monte Carlo-based analysis allowed us to determine with high reliability the magnitude and functional dependence of interdomain forces concurrently with the bending elasticity moduli. In contrast to previous methodologies, this approach enabled us to consider the entropic undulation repulsions on a fundamental level, without having to take recourse to crudely justified mean-field-like additivity assumptions. Our detailed Hamaker-coefficient calculations indicated only small differences in the van der Waals attractions of coexisting Lo and Ld phases. In contrast, the repulsive hydration and undulation interactions differed significantly, with the latter dominating the overall repulsions in the Ld phase. Thus, alignment of like domains in multibilayers appears to originate from both, hydration and undulation repulsions.


Title #120: Lipid Librations at the Interface with the Na,K-ATPase.
PMID: 26083922
Authors: Rita R. Guzzi, Rosa R. Bartucci, Mikael M. Esmann, Derek D. Marsh
Abstract: Transitions between conformational substates of membrane proteins can be driven by torsional librations in the protein that may be coupled to librational fluctuations of the lipid chains. Here, librational motion of spin-labeled lipid chains in membranous Na,K-ATPase is investigated by spin-echo electron paramagnetic resonance. Lipids at the protein interface are targeted by using negatively charged spin-labeled fatty acids that display selectivity of interaction with the Na,K-ATPase. Echo-detected electron paramagnetic resonance spectra from native membranes are corrected for the contribution from the bilayer regions of the membrane by using spectra from dispersions of the extracted membrane lipids. Lipid librations at the protein interface have a flat profile with chain position, whereas librational fluctuations of the bilayer lipids increase pronouncedly from C-9 onward, then flatten off toward the terminal methyl end of the chains. This difference is accounted for by increased torsional amplitude at the chain ends in bilayers, while the amplitude remains restricted throughout the chain at the protein interface with a limited lengthening in correlation time. The temperature dependence of chain librations at the protein interface strongly resembles that of the spin-labeled protein side chains, suggesting solvent-mediated transitions in the protein are driven by fluctuations in the lipid environment.


Title #121: Orientation and Order of the Amide Group of Sphingomyelin in Bilayers Determined by Solid-State NMR.
PMID: 26083921
Authors: Nobuaki N. Matsumori, Toshiyuki T. Yamaguchi, Yoshiko Y. Maeta, Michio M. Murata
Abstract: Sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol) are considered essential for the formation of lipid rafts; however, the types of molecular interactions involved in this process, such as intermolecular hydrogen bonding, are not well understood. Since, unlike other phospholipids, SM is characterized by the presence of an amide group, it is essential to determine the orientation of the amide and its order in the lipid bilayers to understand the nature of the hydrogen bonds in lipid rafts. For this study, 1'-(13)C-2-(15)N-labeled and 2'-(13)C-2-(15)N-labeled SMs were prepared, and the rotational-axis direction and order parameters of the SM amide in bilayers were determined based on (13)C and (15)N chemical-shift anisotropies and intramolecular (13)C-(15)N dipole coupling constants. Results revealed that the amide orientation was minimally affected by Chol, whereas the order was enhanced significantly in its presence. Thus, Chol likely promotes the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen-bond network involving the SM amide without significantly changing its orientation, providing a higher order to the SM amide. To our knowledge, this study offers new insight into the significance of the SM amide orientation with regard to molecular recognition in lipid rafts, and therefore provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of their formation.


Title #122: Deconvolution-free Subcellular Imaging with Axially Swept Light Sheet Microscopy.
PMID: 26083920
Authors: Kevin M KM. Dean, Philippe P. Roudot, Erik S ES. Welf, Gaudenz G. Danuser, Reto R. Fiolka
Abstract: The use of propagation invariant Bessel beams has enabled high-resolution subcellular light sheet fluorescence microscopy. However, the energy within the concentric side lobe structure of Bessel beams increases significantly with propagation length, generating unwanted out-of-focus fluorescence that enforces practical limits on the imaging field of view size. Here, we present a light sheet fluorescence microscope that achieves 390Â nm isotropic resolution and high optical sectioning strength (i.e., out-of-focus blur is strongly suppressed) over large field of views, without the need for structured illumination or deconvolution-based postprocessing. We demonstrate simultaneous dual-color, high-contrast, and high-dynamic-range time-lapse imaging of migrating cells in complex three-dimensional microenvironments, three-dimensional tracking of clathrin-coated pits, and long-term imaging spanning >10Â h and encompassing >2600 time points.


Title #123: Direct Cytoskeleton Forces Cause Membrane Softening in Red Blood Cells.

Abstract: Erythrocytes are flexible cells specialized in the systemic transport of oxygen in vertebrates. This physiological function is connected to their outstanding ability to deform in passing through narrow capillaries. In recent years, there has been an influx of experimental evidence of enhanced cell-shape fluctuations related to metabolically driven activity of the erythroid membrane skeleton. However, no direct observation of the active cytoskeleton forces has yet been reported to our knowledge. Here, we show experimental evidence of the presence of temporally correlated forces superposed over the thermal fluctuations of the erythrocyte membrane. These forces are ATP-dependent and drive enhanced flickering motions in human erythrocytes. Theoretical analyses provide support for a direct force exerted on the membrane by the cytoskeleton nodes as pulses of well-defined average duration. In addition, such metabolically regulated active forces cause global membrane softening, a mechanical attribute related to the functional erythroid deformability.


Title #124: Cytoskeletal to Nuclear Strain Transfer Regulates YAP Signaling in Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
PMID: 26083918
Authors: Tristan P TP. Driscoll, Brian D BD. Cosgrove, Su-Jin SJ. Heo, Zach E ZE. Shurden, Robert L RL. Mauck
Abstract: Mechanical forces transduced to cells through the extracellular matrix are critical regulators of tissue development, growth, and homeostasis, and can play important roles in directing stem cell differentiation. In addition to force-sensing mechanisms that reside at the cell surface, there is growing evidence that forces transmitted through the cytoskeleton and to the nuclear envelope are important for mechanosensing, including activation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) pathway. Moreover, nuclear shape, mechanics, and deformability change with differentiation state and have been likewise implicated in force sensing and differentiation. However, the significance of force transfer to the nucleus through the mechanosensing cytoskeletal machinery in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell mechanobiologic response remains unclear. Here we report that actomyosin-generated cytoskeletal tension regulates nuclear shape and force transmission through the cytoskeleton and demonstrate the differential short- and long-term response of mesenchymal stem cells to dynamic tensile loading based on the contractility state, the patency of the actin cytoskeleton, and the connections it makes with the nucleus. Specifically, we show that while some mechanoactive signaling pathways (e.g., ERK signaling) can be activated in the absence of nuclear strain transfer, cytoskeletal strain transfer to the nucleus is essential for activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway with stretch.


Title #125: Ensemble-Biased Metadynamics: A Molecular Simulation Method to Sample Experimental Distributions.
PMID: 26083917
Authors: Fabrizio F. Marinelli, JosÃ© D JD. Faraldo-GÃ³mez
Abstract: We introduce an enhanced-sampling method for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations referred to as ensemble-biased metadynamics (EBMetaD). The method biases a conventional MD simulation to sample a molecular ensemble that is consistent with one or more probability distributions known a priori, e.g., experimental intramolecular distance distributions obtained by double electron-electron resonance or other spectroscopic techniques. To this end, EBMetaD adds an adaptive biasing potential throughout the simulation that discourages sampling of configurations inconsistent with the target probability distributions. The bias introduced is the minimum necessary to fulfill the target distributions, i.e., EBMetaD satisfies the maximum-entropy principle. Unlike other methods, EBMetaD does not require multiple simulation replicas or the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, and is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in practice. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method for a model system as well as for spin-labeled T4 lysozyme in explicit water, and show how EBMetaD reproduces three double electron-electron resonance distance distributions concurrently within a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time. EBMetaD is integrated in the open-source PLUMED plug-in (www.plumed-code.org), and can be therefore readily used with multiple MD engines.


Title #126: 2-Hydroxy Fatty Acid Enantiomers of Gb3 Impact Shiga Toxin Binding and Membrane Organization.
PMID: 26083916
Authors: Ole M OM. SchÃ¼tte, Lukas J LJ. Patalag, Lucas M C LM. Weber, Annika A. Ries, Winfried W. RÃ¶mer, Daniel B DB. Werz, Claudia C. Steinem
Abstract: Shiga toxin subunit B (STxB) binding to its cellular receptor Gb3 leads to the formation of protein-lipid clusters and bending of the membrane. A newly developed synthetic route allowed synthesizing the biologically most relevant Gb3-C24:1 2OH species with both, the natural (Gb3-R) as well as the unnatural (Gb3-S) configuration of the 2OH group. The derivatives bind STxB with identical nanomolar affinity, while the propensity to induce membrane tubules in giant unilamellar vesicles is more pronounced for Gb3-S. Fluorescence and atomic force microscopy images of phase-separated supported membranes revealed differences in the lateral organization of the protein on the membrane. Gb3-R favorably induces large and tightly packed protein clusters, while a lower protein density is found on Gb3-S doped membranes.


Title #127: Dynamically Driven Protein Allostery Exhibits Disparate Responses for Fast and Slow Motions.
PMID: 26083915
Authors: Jingjing J. Guo, Huan-Xiang HX. Zhou
Abstract: There is considerable interest in the dynamic aspect of allosteric action, and in a growing list of proteins allostery has been characterized as being mediated predominantly by a change in dynamics, not a transition in conformation. For considering conformational dynamics, a protein molecule can be simplified into a number of relatively rigid microdomains connected by joints, corresponding to, e.g., communities and edges from a community network analysis. Binding of an allosteric activator strengthens intermicrodomain coupling, thereby quenching fast (e.g., picosecond to nanosecond) local motions but initiating slow (e.g., microsecond to millisecond), cross-microdomain correlated motions that are potentially of functional importance. This scenario explains allosteric effects observed in many unrelated proteins.


Title #128: Retinal Flip in Rhodopsin Activation?
PMID: 26083914
Authors: Jun J. Feng, Michael F MF. Brown, Blake B. Mertz
Abstract: Rhodopsin is a well-characterized structural model of a G protein-coupled receptor. Photoisomerization of the covalently bound retinal triggers activation. Surprisingly, the x-ray crystal structure of the active Meta-II state has a 180Â° rotation about the long-axis of the retinal polyene chain. Unbiased microsecond-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the retinal cofactor can flip back to the orientation observed in the inactive state of rhodopsin under conditions favoring the Meta-I state. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence from molecular dynamics simulations showing how rotation of the retinal ligand within its binding pocket can occur in the activation mechanism of rhodopsin.


Title #129: Axial Optical Traps: A New Direction for Optical Tweezers.
PMID: 26083913
Authors: Samuel S. Yehoshua, Russell R. Pollari, Joshua N JN. Milstein
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world. Axial optical tweezers, which apply force to a surface-tethered molecule by directly moving either the trap or the stage along the laser beam axis, offer several potential benefits when studying a range of novel biophysical phenomena. This geometry, although it is conceptually straightforward, suffers from aberrations that result in variation of the trap stiffness when the distance between the microscope coverslip and the trap focus is being changed. Many standard techniques, such as back-focal-plane interferometry, are difficult to employ in this geometry due to back-scattered light between the bead and the coverslip, whereas the noise inherent in a surface-tethered assay can severely limit the resolution of an experiment. Because of these complications, precision force spectroscopy measurements have adapted alternative geometries such as the highly successful dumbbell traps. In recent years, however, most of the difficulties inherent in constructing a precision axial optical tweezers have been solved. This review article aims to inform the reader about recent progress in axial optical trapping, as well as the potential for these devices to perform innovative biophysical measurements.


Title #130: Dispersive Interactions in Solution Complexes.
PMID: 26083908
Authors: Hans-JÃ¶rg HJ. Schneider
Abstract: Dispersive interactions are known to play a major role in molecular associations in the gas phase and in the solid state. In solution, however, their significance has been disputed in recent years on the basis of several arguments. A major problem until now has been the separation of dispersive and hydrophobic effects, which are both maximized in water due the low polarizability of this most important medium. Analyses of complexes between porphyrins and systematically varied substrates in water have allowed us to discriminate dispersive from hydrophobic effects, as the latter turned out to be negligible for complexations with flat surfaces such as porphyrins. Also, for the first time, it has become possible to obtain binding free energy increments ÎÎG for a multitude of organic residues including halogen, amide, amino, ether, carbonyl, ester, nitro, sulfur, unsatured, and cyclopropane groups, which turned out to be additive. Binding contributions for saturated residues are unmeasurably small, with ÎÎG > 1 kJ/mol, but they increase to, e.g., ÎÎG = 5 kJ/mol for a nitro group, a value not far from, e.g., that of a stacking pyridine ring. Stacking interactions of heteroarenes with porphyrins depend essentially on the size of the arenes, in line with polarizabilities, and seem to be rather independent of the position of nitrogen within the rings. Measurements of halogen derivatives indicate that complexes with porphyrins, cyclodextrins, and pillarenes as hosts in different media consistently show increasing stability from fluorine to iodine as the substituent. This, and the observed sequence with other substrates, is in line with the expected increase in dispersive forces with increasing polarizability. Induced dipoles, which also would increase with polarizability, can be ruled out as providing the driving source in view of the data with halides: the observed stability sequence is opposite the change of electronegativity from fluorine to iodine. The same holds for the solvent effect observed in ethanol-water mixtures. Dispersive contributions vary not only with the polarizability of the used media but also with the interacting receptor sites; it has been shown that for cucurbiturils the polarizability inside the cavity is extremely low, which also explains why hydrophobic effects are maximized with these hosts. Complexations with other known host compounds, however, such as those between cryptands or cavitands with, e.g., noble gases, bear the signature of dominating dispersive forces. Some recent examples illustrate that such van der Waals forces can also play an important role in complexations with proteins. Again, a clue for this is the increase in ÎG for inhibitor binding by 7 kJ/mol for, e.g., a bromine in comparison to a fluorine derivative.


Title #131: Specific activation, signalling and secretion profiles of human platelets following PAR-1 and PAR-4 stimulation.
PMID: 26083907
Authors: Kim Anh KA. Nguyen, Hind H. Hamzeh-Cognasse, Sandrine S. Laradi, Bruno B. Pozzetto, Olivier O. Garraud, Fabrice F. Cognasse
Abstract: Blood platelets play a central haemostatic function; however, they also play a role in inflammation and are capable of secreting various cytokines, chemokines and related products. The purpose of this study was to identify subtle variations in platelet physiology using proteomics. We compared the levels of membrane proteins (nâ=â3), Î± and Î´ granule proteins (nâ=â18), and signalling proteins (nâ=â30) from unstimulated platelets with those of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1- and PAR-4-stimulated platelets (nâ=â10). The vast majority of these proteins responded similarly to PAR-1 or PAR-4 engagement. However, differences were observed within membrane CD40L expressed, and Î± granule GRO-Î± and MDC secreted proteins.


Title #132: Autoantibodies in movement and psychiatric disorders: updated concepts in detection methods, pathogenicity, and CNS entry.
PMID: 26083906
Authors: Nese N. Sinmaz, Mazen M. Amatoury, Vera V. Merheb, Sudarshini S. Ramanathan, Russell C RC. Dale, Fabienne F. Brilot
Abstract: In recent years, autoantibodies to proteins or receptors expressed on the surface of neurons have been detected in movement and psychiatric disorders. These autoantibodies can assist in better recognition of clinical syndromes and offer novel treatment opportunities via immunotherapies, potentially leading to improved patient outcome. In this review, we describe several autoimmune syndromes associated with movement and psychiatric disorders, including anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis, basal ganglia encephalitis, Sydenham chorea, and autoantibody-associated psychosis and schizophrenia. However, rather than focusing on clinical aspects of these diseases, as they have been reviewed in detail elsewhere, we mainly focus on the scientific aspects of the different methodologies for detecting antibodies, with an emphasis on the current gold standard in the field, the cell-based assay, and on issues related to the use of live versus permeabilized cells. We also reflect on the implications associated with the choice of patient serum and cerebrospinal fluid for antibody testing, on the mechanism of antibody entry into the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier, and the essential issue of antibody pathogenicity.


Title #133: The role and synergistic effect of the light irradiation and H2O2 in photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli.
PMID: 26083904
Authors: Tsz Wai TW. Ng, Taicheng T. An, Guiying G. Li, Wing Kei WK. Ho, Ho Yin HY. Yip, Huijun H. Zhao, Po Keung PK. Wong
Abstract: Inactivation of Escherichia coli K-12 was conducted by applying a continuous supplying of commercial H2O2 to mimic the H2O2 production in a photocatalytic system, and the contribution of H2O2 in photocatalytic inactivation was investigated using a modified "partition system" and five E. coli mutants. The concentration of exogenous H2O2 required for complete inactivation of bacterial cells was much higher than that produced in-situ in common photocatalytic system, indicating that H2O2 alone plays a minor role in photocatalytic inactivation. However, the concentration of exogenously produced H2O2 required for effective inactivation of E. coli K-12 was much lower when the light irradiation was applied. To further investigate the possible physiological changes, inactivation of E. coli BW25113 (the parental strain), and its corresponding isogenic single-gene deletion mutants with light pretreatment was compared. The results indicate that light irradiation increases the bacterial intracellular Fe(2+) level and favors hydroxyl radical (OH) production via the catalytic reaction of Fe(2+), leading to increase in DNA damage. Moreover, the results indicate that the properties of light source, such as intensity and major emission wavelength, may alter the physiology of bacterial cells and affect the susceptibility to in-situ resultant H2O2 in the photocatalytic inactivation processes, leading to significant influence on the photocatalytic inactivation efficiencies of E. coli K-12.

Title #135: The clinical course of asymptomatic esophageal candidiasis incidentally diagnosed in general health inspection.
PMID: 26083902
Authors: Sang Pyo SP. Lee, In-Kyung IK. Sung, Jeong Hwan JH. Kim, Sun-Young SY. Lee, Hyung Seok HS. Park, Chan Sup CS. Shim
Abstract: Esophageal candidiasis mostly occurs in the immunocompromised host. However, it may also affect healthy people and is frequently asymptomatic. The clinical significance of asymptomatic esophageal candidiasis (AEC) is still unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of AEC during health inspection and to identify its predisposing factors and clinical significance.


Title #136: Electrophilic phosphonium cations catalyze hydroarylation and hydrothiolation of olefins.
PMID: 26083901
Authors: Manuel M. PÃ©rez, Tayseer T. Mahdi, Lindsay J LJ. Hounjet, Douglas W DW. Stephan
Abstract: Electrophilic phosphonium cations (EPCs) are efficient main group catalysts for the hydroarylation of olefins under mild conditions, providing a facile route to substituted aniline, bis-arylamine, phenol, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, and indole derivatives. Similarly, EPCs catalyze the hydrothiolation of aryl olefins with thiophenol affording a series of alkyl aryl thioethers. Experimental data support a mechanism for these reactions that involves initial activation of the olefin.


Title #137: Regio- and Stereoselective Functionalization of 16-membered Lactone Aglycone of Spiramycin via Cascade Strategy.
PMID: 26083900
Authors: Katarzyna K. Klich, Krystian K. Pyta, Piotr P. Przybylski
Abstract: Functionalization of 16-membered aglycone of spiramycin with the use of intramolecular cascade strategy yielded access to novel type of diastereopure bicyclic spiramycin derivatives containing tetrahydrofuran ring. Experimental results shows that specific sequence of regio- and stereoselective transformations, based on the intramolecular transesterification, E1cB tandem eliminations, 1,2-addition to carbonyl and 1,6-conjugate addition at the spiramycin aglycone, proceeds with the inversion of absolute configuration at C(5) stereogenic center. Performed cascade and multistep transformations have opened new possibilities in divergent modifications not only spiramycin but also the whole family of leucomycin type antibiotics having similar structure of 16-membered aglycone lactone ring.

Title #142: Investigating H2 Sorption in a Fluorinated Metal-Organic Framework with Small Pores Through Molecular Simulation and Inelastic Neutron Scattering.
PMID: 26083895
Authors: Katherine A KA. Forrest, Tony T. Pham, Peter A PA. Georgiev, Florian F. Pinzan, Christian R CR. Cioce, Tobias T. Unruh, Juergen J. Eckert, Brian B. Space
Abstract: Simulations of H2 sorption were performed in a metal-organic framework (MOF) consisting of Zn(2+) ions coordinated to 1,2,4-triazole and tetrafluoroterephthalate ligands (denoted [Zn(trz)(tftph)] in this work). The simulated H2 sorption isotherms reported in this work are consistent with the experimental data for the state points considered. The experimental H2 isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) values for this MOF are approximately 8.0 kJ mol(-1) for the considered loading range, which is in the proximity of those determined from simulation. The experimental inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra for H2 in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] reveal at least two peaks that occur at low energies, which corresponds to high barriers to rotation for the respective sites. The most favorable sorption site in the MOF was identified from the simulations as sorption in the vicinity of a metal-coordinated H2O molecule, an exposed fluorine atom, and a carboxylate oxygen atom in a confined region in the framework. Secondary sorption was observed between the fluorine atoms of adjacent tetrafluoroterephthalate ligands. The H2 molecule at the primary sorption site in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] exhibits a rotational barrier that exceeds that for most neutral MOFs with open-metal sites according to an empirical phenomenological model and this was further validated by calculating the rotational potential energy surface for H2 at this site.


Title #143: Aristides LeÃ£o: a birth centennial homage with comments on his spreading depression.
PMID: 26083892
Authors: Eliasz E. Engelhardt, Marleide da Mota MD. Gomes
Abstract: The year of 2014 is the birth centenary of Aristides Azevedo Pacheco LeÃ£o (1914-1993), and also marks seventy years of the publication of his discovery of the novel electrophysiological phenomenon, named by him "spreading depression" (SD), soon designated "LeÃ£o's wave" or "LeÃ£o's spreading depression". This was a remarkable scientific milestone, and the author must be celebrated for this achievement, as the studies he triggered proceeded worldwide, with new concepts, as spreading depolarization, until the present days. Robust experimental and clinical evidence emerged to suggest that these and related electrophysiological phenomena are involved in the mechanisms of migraine aura, acute cerebrovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury, transient global amnesia, epileptic seizures, and their pathophysiological characteristics come to offer new therapeutic perspectives. He was a remarkable and complex personality, and the authors remit the readers to a paper where his personal life is contemplated.

Abstract: Part 1 of this guideline addressed the differential diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses (NF): neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis (SCH). NF shares some features such as the genetic origin of the neural tumors and cutaneous manifestations, and affects nearly 80 thousand Brazilians. Increasing scientific knowledge on NF has allowed better clinical management and reduced rate of complications and morbidity, resulting in higher quality of life for NF patients. Most medical doctors are able to perform NF diagnosis, but the wide range of clinical manifestations and the inability to predict the onset or severity of new features, consequences, or complications make NF management a real clinical challenge, requiring the support of different specialists for proper treatment and genetic counseling, especially in NF2 and SCH. The present text suggests guidelines for the clinical management of NF, with emphasis on NF1.


Title #145: Lean thinking turns 'time is brain' into reality.
PMID: 26083890
Authors: Li Min LM. Li, Sharon S. Johnson
Abstract: Intravenous rt-PA is an effective recanalizing treatment for ischemic stroke within 4 and half hours from its onset (Onset-to-Treatment [OTT]), with the best result seen in those treated within 90 minutes OTT. Yet few patients currently are treated in this time frame. From the standpoint of process improvement or a lean thinking perspective, there is a potential opportunity to reduce the time by eliminating non-value-added steps in each element of the stroke survival chain. The reduction in one time element does not necessarily shift the OTT under 90 minutes. Most likely, the reduction in OTT requires a coordinated approach to track and improve all elements of OTT, from the patient's ability to recognize the onset of stroke up to delivery of medication. Shortening this total time should be a considered an indicator of quality improvement in acute stroke care.


Title #146: Action verbal fluency in Parkinson's patients.
PMID: 26083889
Authors: InÃªs Tello IT. Rodrigues, Joaquim J JJ. Ferreira, Miguel M. Coelho, Mario M MM. Rosa, Alexandre A. Castro-Caldas
Abstract: We compared the performance of 31 non-demented ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) patients to 61 healthy controls in an action verbal fluency task. Semantic and phonemic fluencies, cognitive impairment and behavioural dysfunction were also assessed. The mean disease duration of PD was 9.8 years (standard deviation (SD) = 6.13). There were no age (U = 899.5, p = 0.616), gender(chi-square = 0.00, p = 1.00) or literacy (U = 956, p = 0.96) differences between the two groups. A significant difference was observed between the two groups in the action verbal fluency task (U = 406.5, p < 0.01) that was not found in the other fluency tasks. The education level was the only biographical variable that influenced the action (verb) fluency outcomes, irrespective of disease duration. Our findings suggest a correlation between the disease mechanisms in PD and a specific verb deficit, support the validity of the action (verb) fluency as an executive function measure and suggest that this task provides unique information not captured with traditional executive function tasks.


Title #147: Objective short sleep duration is associated with the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in insomnia.
PMID: 26083888
Authors: Carolina C. D'Aurea, Dalva D. Poyares, Ronaldo D RD. Piovezan, Gisele G. Passos, Sergio S. Tufik, Marco Tulio de MT. Mello
Abstract: Objective To evaluate the association between objective short sleep duration in patients with insomnia and changes in blood parameters related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity.Method A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted in 30 middle-aged adults with chronic insomnia who were divided into 2 groups according to polysomnography (PSG) total sleep time (TST) (TST > 5h and < 5h). All patients underwent subjective analysis of sleep quality, anthropometric measurements, PSG, and determination off asting blood parameters.Results The results revealed lower sleep efficiency and higher sleep latency for those with a TST < 5h. The subjective sleep quality was worse in the TST < 5h. Significantly, higher glucose and cortisol levels were observed with a TST < 5h. Glucose, cortisol and ACTH levels were inversely correlated with the PSG total sleep time.Conclusion Patients with insomnia with objective short sleep duration had HPA-associated endocrine and metabolic imbalances chronically linked to increases in cardiovascular risk observed with this more severe insomnia phenotype.


Title #148: Mortality predictors of epilepsy and epileptic seizures among hospitalized elderly.
PMID: 26083887
Authors: Telma M R TM. Assis, Aroldo A. Bacellar, Gersonita G. Costa, Osvaldo J M OJ. Nascimento
Abstract: Epilepsy and epileptic seizures are common brain disorders in the elderly and are associated with increased mortality that may be ascribed to the underlying disease or epilepsy-related causes. Objective To describe mortality predictors of epilepsy and epileptic seizures in elderly inpatients.Method Retrospective analysis was performed on hospitalized elderly who had epilepsy or epileptic seizures, from January 2009 to December 2010. One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled.Results The most common etiology was ischemic stroke (37%), followed by neoplasias (13%), hemorrhagic stroke (12%), dementias (11.4%) and metabolic disturbances (5.5%). In a univariate analysis, disease duration (p = 0.04), status epilepticus (p < 0.001) and metabolic etiology (p = 0.005) were associated with mortality. However after adjustment by logistic regression, only status epilepticus remained an independent predictor of death (odds ratio = 13; 95%CI = 2.3 to 72; p = 0.004).Conclusion In this study status epilepticus was an independent risk factor for death during hospitalization.

Abstract: Introduction The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with focus on the mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA).Objective To analyse the polymorphism SNCA-A53T in patients with familial PD (FPD) and sporadic PD (SPD).Method A total of 294 individuals were studied, regardless of sex and with mixed ethnicity. The study group with 154 patients with PD, and the control group included 140 individuals without PD. The genotyping of SNCA-A53T was performed by PCR/RFLP. Significance level was p < 0.05.Results Among all patients, 37 (24%) had FPD and 117 (75.9%) had SPD. The absence of SNCA-A53T mutation was observed in all individuals.Conclusion SPD is notably observed in patients. However, the SNCA-A53T mutation was absent in all individuals, which does not differ controls from patients. This fact should be confirmed in a Brazilian study case with a more numerous and older population.

PMID: 26083885
Authors: Fernando Campos Gomes FC. Pinto, Matheus Fernandes de MF. Oliveira, Ricardo R. Prist, MaurÃ­cio Rocha E MR. Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz da LF. Silva, Antonio A. Capone Neto
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the main cause of trauma-related deaths. Systemic hypotension and intracranial hypertension causes cerebral ischemia by altering metabolism of prostanoids. We describe prostanoid, pupilar and pathological response during resuscitation with hypertonic saline solution (HSS) in TBI. Method Fifteen dogs were randomized in three groups according to resuscitation after TBI (control group; lactated Ringer's (LR) group and HSS group), with measurement of thromboxane, prostaglandin, macroscopic and microscopic pathological evaluation and pupil evaluation.Result Concentration of prostaglandin is greater in the cerebral venous blood than in plasma and the opposite happens with concentration of thromboxane. Pathology revealed edema in groups with the exception of group treated with HSS.Discussion and conclusion There is a balance between the concentrations of prostaglandin and thromboxane. HSS prevented the formation of cerebral edema macroscopically detectable. Pupillary reversal occurred earlier in HSS group than in LR group.


Title #151: Post-activation depression of the lower extremities in stroke patients with spasticity and spastic equinovarus deformity.
PMID: 26083884
Authors: Yuanbin Y. Yang, Juan J. Xiao, Weiqun W. Song
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate changes of post-activation depression in two groups of patients with or without spastic equinovarus deformity (SED). Paired and independent t-tests were used to compare post-activation depression within and between the groups, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between diminished post-activation depression and spasticity severity. The soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) post-activation depression values were significantly decreased on the affected sides of patients with SED compared to those without. In patients without SED, the soleus post-activation depression was significantly decreased on the affected side; however, TA post-activation depression was higher on the affected side. Both the soleus and TA become active, but the onset time may be different. The imbalanced muscle tone between the soleus and TA in the early stage after stroke may be related to equinus deformity.


Title #152: Horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: diagnosis and treatment of 37 patients.
PMID: 26083883
Authors: Eliana Teixeira ET. MaranhÃ£o, PÃ©ricles P. MaranhÃ£o Filho
Abstract: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most frequent cause of vertigo is associated with high morbidity in the elderly population. The most common form is linked to debris in the posterior semicircular canal. However, there has been an increasing number of reported BPPV cases involving the horizontal canals. The purpose of this article is to highlight the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment in 37 patients with horizontal canal BPPV; twenty-six with geotropic nystagmus, and eleven with the apogeotropic form. Treatment consisted of the Gufoni manoeuver in eighteen patients (48.6%), the barbecue 360Â° maneuver in twelve patients (32.4%), both manoeuvers in four patients (10.8%), both manoeuvers plus head shaking in one patient (2.7%), and the Gufoni maneuver plus head shaking in two patients. Cupulolithiasis patients were asked to sleep in a forced prolonged position. We obtained a complete resolution of vertigo and nystagmus in 30 patients (81.0%) on the initial visit.


Title #153: Cognitive reserve and the severity of Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: 26083882
Authors: Margarida M. Sobral, Maria Helena MH. Pestana, ConstanÃ§a C. PaÃºl
Abstract: AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD) is a clinical syndrome caused by neurodegeneration and characterized by a progressive deterioration in cognitive ability and capacity for independent living. Cognitive reserve (CR) describes the capacity of the adult brain to cope with the effects of the neurodegenerative process and to minimize the clinical manifestation of pathology of dementia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of CR and the severity of AD. Method This study was cross-sectional. Functional and neuropsychological abilities of 75 outpatients with probable AD diagnosis were evaluated. Patients completed two questionnaires, "Participation in leisure activities throughout life" and CR Questionnaire.Result The relationship between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the level of CR was statistically significant (likelihood ratio (LR), p = 0.015).Conclusion The level of CR influenced the severity of dementia. This study suggests that AD patients with higher CR may benefit against cognitive decline after diagnosis of AD.

Abstract: Given the increasing use of computed tomography (CT) in the UK over the last 30âyears, it is essential to ensure that all imaging protocols are optimised to keep radiation doses as low as reasonably practicable, consistent with the intended clinical task. However, the complexity of modern CT equipment can make this task difficult to achieve in practice. Recent results of local patient dose audits have shown discrepancies between two Philips CT scanners that use the DoseRight 2.0 automatic exposure control (AEC) system in the 'automatic' mode of operation. The use of this system can result in drifting dose and image quality performance over time as it is designed to evolve based on operator technique. The purpose of this study was to develop a practical technique for configuring examination protocols on four CT scanners that use the DoseRight 2.0 AEC system in the 'manual' mode of operation. This method used a uniform phantom to generate reference images which form the basis for how the AEC system calculates exposure factors for any given patient. The results of this study have demonstrated excellent agreement in the configuration of the CT scanners in terms of average patient dose and image quality when using this technique. This work highlights the importance of CT protocol harmonisation in a modern Radiology department to ensure both consistent image quality and radiation dose. Following this study, the average radiation dose for a range of CT examinations has been reduced without any negative impact on clinical image quality.

Abstract: Glutathione (GSH) is the one of the most abundant intracellular antioxidants. Mice lacking the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, have decreased GSH. Our prior work showed that GSH plays antiapoptotic roles in ovarian follicles. We hypothesized that Gclm-/- mice have accelerated ovarian aging due to ovarian oxidative stress. We found significantly decreased ovarian GSH concentrations and oxidized GSH/GSSG redox potential in Gclm-/- versus Gclm+/+ ovaries. Prepubertal Gclm-/- and Gclm+/+ mice had similar numbers of ovarian follicles, and as expected, the total number of ovarian follicles declined with age in both genotypes. However, the rate of decline in follicles was significantly more rapid in Gclm-/- mice, and this was driven by accelerated declines in primordial follicles, which constitute the ovarian reserve. We found significantly increased 4-hydroxynonenal immunostaining (oxidative lipid damage marker) and significantly increased nitrotyrosine immunostaining (oxidative protein damage marker) in prepubertal and adult Gclm-/- ovaries compared to controls. The percentage of small ovarian follicles with increased granulosa cell proliferation was significantly higher in prepubertal and 2 month old Gclm-/- versus Gclm+/+ ovaries, indicating accelerated recruitment of primordial follicles into the growing pool. The percentages of growing follicles with apoptotic granulosa cells were increased in young adult ovaries. Our results demonstrate increased ovarian oxidative stress and oxidative damage in young Gclm-/- mice, associated with an accelerated decline in ovarian follicles that appears to be mediated by increased recruitment of follicles into the growing pool, followed by apoptosis at later stages of follicular development.

Abstract: "Metabolic memory" is identified as a phenomenon that prior exposure to hyperglycemia results in the long-lasting deleterious effects on cardiovascular events. More and more researches show that epigenetics plays an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic memory. It remains unclear whether microRNA (miRNA) dysfunctions participate in the event. In this study, the miRNA arrays on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were adopted to seek the miRNAs which may be involved in the metabolic memory and were verified in vivo and in vitro. Sixteen miRNAs were found differentially expressed. Among these miRNAs, the expressions of miR-125b, miR-146a-5p and miR-29a-3p were associated with persistent impaired endothelial function and altered pro-inflammatory gene expressions including nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) subunit p65. Direct inhibition of miR-125b expression or increased miR-146a-5p expression blunted NF-ÎºB signals and improved the endothelial function. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed the biochemical relationship for miR-125b targeting on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), and miR-146a targeting on TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) during the activation of NF-ÎºB pathway. Thus our findings demonstrate that glucose induced changes in miR-125b and miR-146a-5p are related to the long-lasting activation of NF-ÎºB pathway and contribute to follow-up metabolic memory.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological syndrome in which motor neurons degenerate relentlessly. Although the site of onset and the rate of spread have been studied extensively, little is known about whether focal as opposed to diffuse disease affects prognosis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that regionality of disease burden is a prognostic factor in ALS. We analysed clinical data from two large multicentre, longitudinal trials. Regionality was defined as the difference in progression rates in three domains as measured by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale, omitting the respiratory domain from analysis. We used death by trial end as the outcome variable and tested this by logistic regression against predictor variables including regionality and overall rate of disease progression. There were 561 patients. Regionality of disease was independently associated with significantly higher chance of death by study end (odds ratio most diffuse against most focal category 0.354 (0.191, 0.657), p = 0.001), with a direct relationship between degree of regionality and odds of death. We have shown using clinical trial data that focal disease is associated with a worse prognosis in ALS. Measures of regionality warrant further independent consideration in the development of future prognostic models.


Title #159: A common functional allele of the Nogo receptor gene, reticulon 4 receptor (RTN4R), is associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a French population.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is sporadic (SALS) in 90% of cases and has complex environmental and genetic influences. Nogo protein inhibits neurite outgrowth and is overexpressed in muscle in ALS. Our aims were to study the reticulon 4 receptor gene RTN4R which encodes Nogo 1 receptor (NgR1) in SALS, to test if the variants were associated with variable expression of the gene and whether NgR1 protein expression was modified in a transgenic mouse model of ALS. We genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs701421, rs701427, and rs1567871) of the RTN4R gene in 364 SALS French patients and 430 controls. We examined expression of RTN4R mRNA by quantitative PCR in control post mortem human brain tissue. We determined the expression of NgR1 protein in spinal motor neurons from a SOD1 G86R ALS mouse model. We observed significant associations between SALS and RTN4R alleles. Messenger RNA expression from RTN4R in human cortical brain tissue correlated significantly with the genotypes of rs701427. NgR1 protein expression was reduced in Nogo A positive motor neurons from diseased transgenic animals. In conclusion, these observations suggest that a functional RTN4R gene variant is associated with SALS. This variant may act in concert with other genetic variants or environmental influences.


Title #160: Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Minnesota: A year-long population based study.
PMID: 26083871
Authors: Caitlin J CJ. Harper, Eric J EJ. Sorenson, Jay J. Mandrekar
Abstract: This is the largest population based study of ALS in the U.S., encompassing the population of Minnesota (> 5.4 million people) from July 2013 to July 2014. Data on gender, age at diagnosis, and residential county were collected for all Minnesota residents who registered with the Minnesota/North Dakota/South Dakota chapter of the ALS Association from July 2013 to July 2014. Incidence rates were calculated as the number of new cases of ALS per 100,000 people per year. The standardized incidence rates for the 2013 U.S. population and the 2013 European standard population were also reported. Results showed that the crude incidence rate of ALS was 2.2 cases per 100,000 person-years. Incidence increased with age, peaking at 70-79 years (8.3 per 100,000) with mean age at diagnosis 64 years, and was greater in males (2.4 per 100,000) than in females (1.5 per 100,000). Standardized incidence rates for the 2013 U.S. and European standard population were 2.2 and 2.39 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. In conclusion, the overall incidence and age and gender patterns of ALS in Minnesota are comparable to those reported by European studies ( 1-5 ).

Abstract: Gold is a noble metal that, in comparison with silver and copper, has the advantage of corrosion resistance. Despite its high conductivity, chemical stability and biocompatibility, gold exhibits high plasticity, which limits its applications in some nanodevices. Here, we report an experimental and theoretical study on how to attain enhanced mechanical stability of gold nanotips. The gold tips were fabricated by chemical etching and further encapsulated with carbon nanocones via nanomanipulation. Atomic force microscopy experiments were carried out to test their mechanical stability. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the encapsulated nanocone changes the strain release mechanisms at the nanoscale by blocking gold atomic sliding, redistributing the strain along the whole nanostructure. The carbon nanocones are conducting and can induce magnetism, thus opening new avenues on the exploitation of transport, mechanical and magnetic properties of gold covered by sp(2) carbon at the nanoscale.


Title #165: A framework for automated contour quality assurance in radiation therapy including adaptive techniques.

Abstract: Contouring of targets and normal tissues is one of the largest sources of variability in radiation therapy treatment plans. Contours thus require a time intensive and error-prone quality assurance (QA) evaluation, limitations which also impair the facilitation of adaptive radiotherapy (ART). Here, an automated system for contour QA is developed using historical data (the 'knowledge base'). A pilot study was performed with a knowledge base derived from 9 contours each from 29 head-and-neck treatment plans. Size, shape, relative position, and other clinically-relevant metrics and heuristically derived rules are determined. Metrics are extracted from input patient data and compared against rules determined from the knowledge base; a computer-learning component allows metrics to evolve with more input data, including patient specific data for ART. Nine additional plans containing 42 unique contouring errors were analyzed. 40/42 errors were detected as were 9 false positives. The results of this study imply knowledge-based contour QA could potentially enhance the safety and effectiveness of RT treatment plans as well as increase the efficiency of the treatment planning process, reducing labor and the cost of therapy for patients.


Title #166: Positive Catch & Economic Benefits of Periodic Octopus Fishery Closures: Do Effective, Narrowly Targeted Actions 'Catalyze' Broader Management?

Abstract: Eight years of octopus fishery records from southwest Madagascar reveal significant positive impacts from 36 periodic closures on: (a) fishery catches and (b) village fishery income, such that (c) economic benefits from increased landings outweigh costs of foregone catch. Closures covered ~20% of a village's fished area and lasted 2-7 months.


Title #167: Parental Reports on Touch Screen Use in Early Childhood.
PMID: 26083848
Authors: Alejandrina A. Cristia, Amanda A. Seidl
Abstract: Touch screens are increasingly prevalent, and anecdotal evidence suggests that young children are very drawn towards them. Yet there is little data regarding how young children use them. A brief online questionnaire queried over 450 French parents of infants between the ages of 5 and 40 months on their young child's use of touch-screen technology. Parents estimated frequency of use, and further completed several checklists. Results suggest that, among respondent families, the use of touch screens is widespread in early childhood, meaning that most children have some exposure to touch screens. Among child users, certain activities are more frequently reported to be liked than others, findings that we discuss in light of current concern for children's employment of time and the cognitive effects of passive media exposure. Additionally, these parental reports point to clear developmental trends for certain types of interactive gestures. These results contribute to the investigation of touch screen use on early development and suggest a number of considerations that should help improve the design of applications geared towards toddlers, particularly for scientific purposes.


Title #168: Modeling development and quantitative trait mapping reveal independent genetic modules for leaf size and shape.

Abstract: Improved predictions of fitness and yield may be obtained by characterizing the genetic controls and environmental dependencies of organismal ontogeny. Elucidating the shape ofÂ growth curves may reveal novel genetic controls that single-time-point (STP) analyses doÂ not because, in theory, infinite numbers of growth curves can result in the same final measurement. We measured leaf lengths and widths in Brassica rapa recombinant inbred lines (RILs) throughout ontogeny. We modeled leaf growth and allometry as function valued traits (FVT), and examined genetic correlations between these traits and aspects of phenology, physiology, circadian rhythms and fitness. We used RNA-seq to construct a SNP linkage map and mapped trait quantitative trait loci (QTL). We found genetic trade-offs between leaf size and growth rate FVT and uncovered differences in genotypic and QTL correlations involving FVT vs STPs. We identified leaf shape (allometry) as a genetic module independent of length and width and identified selection on FVT parameters of development. Leaf shape is associated with venation features that affect desiccation resistance. The genetic independence of leaf shape from other leaf traits may therefore enable crop optimization in leaf shape without negative effects on traits such as size, growth rate, duration or gas exchange.


Title #169: Characterization of Silk Fibroin/Chitosan 3D Porous Scaffold and In Vitro Cytology.

Abstract: Bone tissue engineering is a powerful tool to treat bone defects caused by trauma, infection, tumors and other factors. Both silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS) are non-toxic and have good biocompatibility, but are poor biological scaffolds when used alone. In this study, the microscopic structure and related properties of SF/CS composite scaffolds with different component ratios were examined. The scaffold material most suitable for osteoblast growth was determined, and these results offer an experimental basis for the future reconstruction of bone defects. First, via freeze-drying and chemical crosslinking methods, SF/CS composites with different component ratios were prepared and their structure was characterized. Changes in the internal structure of the SF and CS mixture were observed, confirming that the mutual modification between the two components was complete and stable. The internal structure of the composite material was porous and three-dimensional with a porosity above 90%. We next studied the pore size, swelling ratio, water absorption ratio, degradation and in vitro cell proliferation. For the 40% SF-60% CS group, the pore size of the scaffold was suitable for the growth of osteoblasts, and the rate of degradation was steady. This favors the early adhesion, growth and proliferation of MG-63 cells. In addition to good biocompatibility and satisfactory cell affinity, this material promotes the secretion of extracellular matrix materials by osteoblasts. Thus, 40% SF-60% CS is a good material for bone tissue engineering.


Title #170: Modulating Electrical Properties of InAs Nanowires via Molecular Monolayers.
PMID: 26083845

Abstract: In recent years, InAs nanowires have been demonstrated with the excellent electron mobility as well as the highly efficient near-infrared and visible photo-response at room temperature. However, due to the presence of large amount of surface states originated from the unstable native oxide, the fabricated nanowire transistors are always operated in the depletion mode with degraded electron mobility, which is not energy efficient. In this work, instead of the conventional inorganic sulfur or alkanethiol surface passivation, we employ the aromatic thiolate (ArS-) based molecular monolayers with controllable molecular design and electron density for the surface modification of InAs nanowires (i.e. device channels) by simple wet chemistry. More importantly, besides reliably improving the device performances by enhancing the electron mobility and the current on-off ratio through the surface state passivation, the device threshold voltage (VTh) can also be modulated by varying the para-substituent of the monolayers such that the molecule bearing electron withdrawing groups would significantly shift the VTh towards the positive region for the enhancement operation and vice versa, in which the effect has been quantified by density-functional theory calculations. All these findings reveal explicitly the efficient modulation of InAs nanowires electronic transport properties via ArS- based molecular monolayers, which further elucidates the technological potency of this ArS- surface treatment for the future nanoelectronic device fabrication and circuit integration.

Title #172: [Skin disorder as an indication of viral infection].
PMID: 26083843
Authors: S M SM. Snelder, L K LK. Engels, H. H. van der Valk, M C G MC. van Praag
Abstract: Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a dermatosis primarily affecting children between 2 and 6 years of age. It is characterized by multiple, itching, monomorphous, pink to red-brown papules or papulovesicles between 1 and 5 mm in size. GCS is associated with viral infections such as hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is often accompanied by fever, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. The syndrome is self-limiting and disappears within 2 months. No treatment is therefore required.


Title #173: [Waking up during general anaesthesia].
PMID: 26083842
Authors: R D L RD. Akkerman, J T A JT. Knape
Abstract: - Awareness with recall is defined as 'both conscious experience and memory of events during surgery'. Perceptions of sound, pain or paralysis and assimilation of these in the memory can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.- Prospective studies report an incidence of 0.1-1%.- Risk factors include those circumstances that result in under-dosing of anaesthetic agents relative to the patient's specific requirement.- A lack of reliable monitoring of depth of anaesthesia is a result of our limited knowledge of the effect of anaesthetics on consciousness and memory.- No additional benefit has been shown for the use of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring compared with measuring the expired concentration of an inhaled anaesthetic agent.- High-risk patients undergoing total intravenous anaesthesia may benefit from BIS for monitoring depth of anaesthesia.- Further scientific investigation of the neurological processes involved in awareness with recall is required in order to develop novel monitoring techniques.


Title #174: [Statins after intracerebral haemorrhage: is this safe?]
PMID: 26083841
Authors: J. J. Versmissen, M. M. Scheele, D W J DW. Dippel, A H AH. van den Meiracker
Abstract: - Epidemiological research suggests that there is an inverse relationship between serum cholesterol level and the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).- In the SPARCL (Stroke prevention by aggressive reduction in cholesterol levels) study in over 4000 patients who suffered stroke, ICH or TIA, the risk of ICH was found to be higher in the atorvastatin group than in the placebo group. - In meta-analyses of large statin trials no increased risk of ICH was found, most likely as a consequence of a low absolute risk of ICH.- Results of available studies indicate that the possibility that use of statins increases the risk of ICH cannot be excluded but that this is only of clinical relevance in patients with a history of ICH.- Statins do not need to be terminated immediately in patients with ICH.- At check-up following ICH, the decision to start or to continue statins should be made based on the risk to the patient of ischemic cardiovascular disease and the estimated risk of recurrent haemorrhage, depending on the type of haemorrhage.

PMID: 26083839
Authors: G W J GW. Frederix, A M AM. HÃ¶vels, J L JL. Severens, J A M JA. Raaijmakers, J H M JH. Schellens
Abstract: - There is increasing discussion in the Netherlands about the introduction of a threshold value for the costs per extra year of life when reimbursing costs of new drugs. - The Medicines Committee ('Commissie Geneesmiddelen'), a division of the Netherlands National Healthcare Institute ('Zorginstituut Nederland'), advises on reimbursement of costs of new drugs. - This advice is based upon the determination of therapeutic value of the drug and the results of economic evaluations.- Mathematical models that predict future costs and effectiveness are often used in economic evaluations; these models can vary greatly in transparency and quality due to author assumptions.- Standardisation of cost-effectiveness models is one solution to overcome the unwanted variation in quality.- Discussions about the introduction of a threshold value can only be meaningful if all involved are adequately informed, and by high quality in cost-effectiveness research and, particularly, economic evaluations.- Collaboration and discussion between medical specialists, patients or patient organisations, health economists and policy makers, both in development of methods and in standardisation, are essential to improve the quality of decision making.


Title #177: RNA of Enterococcus faecalis Strain EC-12 Is a Major Component Inducing Interleukin-12 Production from Human Monocytic Cells.
PMID: 26083838
Authors: Ryoichiro R. Nishibayashi, Ryo R. Inoue, Yuri Y. Harada, Takumi T. Watanabe, Yuko Y. Makioka, Kazunari K. Ushida
Abstract: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important cytokine for the immunomodulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Using murine immune cells, we previously reported that the RNA of Enterococcus faecalis EC-12, a LAB strain exerting probiotic-like beneficial effects, is the major IL-12-inducing immunogenic component. However, it was recently revealed that bacterial RNA can be a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 13, which is only expressed in mice. Because TLR13 is not expressed in humans, the immuno-stimulatory and -modulatory effects of LAB RNA in human cells should be augmented excluding TLR13 contribution. In experiment 1 of this study, the role of LAB RNA in IL-12 induction in human immune cells was studied using three LAB strains, E.faecalis EC-12, Lactobacillus gasseri JCM5344, and Bifidobacterium breve JCM1192. RNase A treatment of heat-killed LAB significantly decreased the IL-12 production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on stimulation, while RNase III treatment revealed virtually no effects. Further, IL-12 production against heat-killed E. faecalis EC-12 was abolished by depleting monocytes. These results demonstrated that single stranded RNA (ssRNA) of LAB is a strong inducer of IL-12 production from human monocytes. In experiment 2, major receptor for ssRNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was identified using THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. The type of RNA molecules of E. faecalis EC-12 responsible for IL-12 induction was also identified. IL-12 production induced by the total RNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was significantly reduced by the treatment of siRNA for TLR8 but not for TLR7. Furthermore, both 23S and 16S rRNA, but not mRNA, of E. faecalis EC-12 markedly induced IL-12 production from THP-1 cells. These results suggested that the recognition of ssRNA of E. faecalis EC-12 was mediated by TLR8 and that rRNA was the RNA molecule that exhibited IL-12-inducing ability in human cells.


Title #178: It's Not Me, It's You: Perceptions of Partner Body Image Preferences Associated With Eating Disorder Symptoms in Gay and Heterosexual Men.
PMID: 26083837
Authors: Lauren M LM. Fussner, April R AR. Smith
Abstract: This study explored perceptions of partner body image preferences and symptoms of disordered eating in gay and heterosexual men. Participants were male college students (nÂ =Â 201; M ageÂ =Â 20.46) and over one-third identified as gay. We compared discrepancies between participants' current and ideal body type and participants' current body type and the body type they believed they should have in order to attract a dating partner. For gay men, the discrepancy between their current body and the body they believed they should have to attract a dating partner was significantly greater than the discrepancy between their current and ideal body types. In gay and heterosexual men, the discrepancy between current body and the body they believed they should have to attract a dating partner predicted eating, shape, and weight concern. Results suggest that perceptions of partner body image preferences may contribute to eating disorder pathology in men.

Title #182: COPII Dependent ER Export: a Critical Component of Insulin Biogenesis and Beta Cell ER Homeostasis.
PMID: 26083833

Abstract: Pancreatic beta cells possess a highly active protein synthetic and export machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to accommodate the massive production of proinsulin. ER homeostasis is vital for beta cell functions and is maintained by the delicate balance between protein synthesis, folding, export and degradation. Disruption of ER homeostasis by diabetes-causing factors leads to beta cell death. Among the four components to maintain ER homeostasis in beta cells, the role of ER export in insulin biogenesis is the least understood. To address this knowledge gap, the present study investigated the molecular mechanism of proinsulin ER export in MIN6 cells and primary islets. Two inhibitory mutants of the Sar1 small GTPase, known to specifically block COPII (coat protein complex II)-dependent ER export, were over-expressed in beta cells using recombinant adenoviruses. Results from this approach, as well as siRNA-mediated Sar1 knockdown, demonstrated that defective Sar1 function blocked proinsulin ER export and abolished its conversion to mature insulin in MIN6 cells, isolated mouse and human islets. It is further revealed, using an in vitro vesicle formation assay, that proinsulin was packaged into COPII vesicles in a GTP- and Sar1-dependent manner. Blockage of COPII-dependent ER exit by Sar1 mutants strongly induced ER morphology change, ER stress response and beta cell apoptosis. These responses were mediated by the PERK/pEIF2Î± and IRE1/Xbp1 pathways but not via ATF6. Collectively, results from the study demonstrate that COPII-dependent ER export plays a vital role in insulin biogenesis, ER homeostasis, and beta cell survival.


Title #183: Catalytic Conversion of Hexagonal Boron Nitride to Graphene for In-Plane Heterostructures.

Abstract: Heterostructures of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene have attracted a great deal of attention for potential applications in 2D materials. While several methods have been developed to produce this material through the partial substitution reaction of graphene, the reverse reaction has not been reported. While the endothermic nature of this reaction might account for the difficulty and previous absence of such a process, we report herein a new chemical route in which the Pt substrate plays a catalytic role. We propose that this reaction proceeds through h-BN hydrogenation; subsequent graphene growth quickly replaces the initially etched region. Importantly, this conversion reaction enables the controlled formation of patterned in-plane graphene/h-BN heterostructures, without needing the commonly employed protecting mask, simply by using a patterned Pt substrate.

Title #185: Sequence-dependent promoter escape efficiency is strongly influenced by bias for the pre-translocated state during initial transcription.
PMID: 26083830
Authors: JÃ¸rgen J. Skancke, Nadav N. Bar, Martin M. Kuiper, Lilian Ming-Te LM. Hsu
Abstract: Abortive transcription initiation can be rate limiting for promoter escape and therefore represents a barrier to productive gene expression. The mechanism for abortive initiation is unknown, but the amount of abortive transcript is known to vary with the composition of the initial transcribed sequence (ITS). Here, we used a thermodynamic model of translocation combined with experimental validation to investigate the relationship between ITS and promoter escape on a set of phage T5 N25 promoters. We found a strong, negative correlation between RNAP's propensity to occupy the pre-translocated state during initial transcription and the efficiency of promoter escape (r = -0.67, p < 10^-6 ). This correlation was almost entirely caused by free energy changes due to variation in the RNA 3\ppp dinucleotide sequence at each step, implying that this sequence element controls the disposition of initial transcribing complexes. We tested our model experimentally by constructing a set of novel N25-ITS promoter variants; quantitative transcription analysis again showed a strong correlation (r = -0.81, p < 10^-6 ). Our results support a model in which sequence-directed bias for the pre-translocated state during scrunching results in increased backtracking, which limits the efficiency of promoter escape. This provides an answer to the long-standing issue of how sequence composition of the ITS affects promoter escape efficiency.


Title #186: The Changing World of Breast Cancer: A Radiologist's Perspective.
PMID: 26083829
Authors: Christiane K CK. Kuhl
Abstract: Compared with other fields of medicine, there is hardly an area that has seen such fast development as the world of breast cancer. Indeed, the way we treat breast cancer has changed fundamentally over the past decades. Breast imaging has always been an integral part of this change, and it undergoes constant adjustment to new ways of thinking. This relates not only to the technical tools we use for diagnosing breast cancer but also to the way diagnostic information is used to guide treatment. There is a constant change of concepts for and attitudes toward breast cancer, and a constant flux of new ideas, new treatment approaches, and new insights into the molecular and biological behavior of this disease. Clinical breast radiologists and even more so, clinician scientists, interested in breast imaging need to keep abreast with this rapidly changing world. Diagnostic or treatment approaches that are considered useful today may be abandoned tomorrow. Approaches that seem irrelevant or far too extravagant today may prove clinically useful and adequate next year. Radiologists must constantly question what they do, and align their clinical aims and research objectives with the changing needs of contemporary breast oncology. Moreover, knowledge about the past helps better understand present debates and controversies. Accordingly, in this article, we provide an overview on the evolution of breast imaging and breast cancer treatment, describe current areas of research, and offer an outlook regarding the years to come.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Abstract: Subjects To evaluate antibody persistence of Aleph inactivated split influenza vaccine, 3308 healthy Chinese people more than 3Â years old were enrolled in a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay before vaccination, 641 were screened by HI assay negative, 437 of which received one dose of Aleph inactivated split influenza vaccine and 204 of which received one dose of control vaccine (recombinant hepatitis B ). After vaccination, the receivers were collected blood at 1(st) month, 3(rd) month ,6(th) month and 12(th) month for Aleh influenza vaccine antibody persistence assess. The antibody test were determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Results There were significant difference in antibody geometric mean titer between experimental group and control at 1(st) month and 3(rd) month after vaccination. Influenza antibody could persist at least up to 3(rd) month. Because of the local spring influenza epidemic, we could not analyze the results of 6(th) and 12(th) month. Conclusion Aleph influenza vaccines showed good immune persistence in healthy volunteers at least in the three months after vaccination. Background Influenza viruses are important human respiratory pathogens. Immunization is widely acknowledged to currently be the most effective method of minimizing the impact of pandemic influenza. Through we have checked many references about Influenza vaccine, the duration of protective antibody for influenza vaccines are still not available. Based on this situation and our previous work([11]), Influenza vaccine antibody duration analyze are necessary. Objectives This manuscript presents data on the persistence of Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) immune response against the A/California/7/2009(H1N1), A/Peth/16/2009(H3N2) strain and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Subjects 641 were screened from 3302 volunteers by HI test of influenza A and confirmed enrollment based on the antibodies titer less than 1:10. After administered with one dose of Aleph influenza vaccine, blood samples were collected. 437 subjects (3-10y: 131; 11-17y: 110; 18-54y: 69; â¥55y: 127) were vaccinated influenza vaccine as test group. 204 subjects (3-10 y: 70; 11-17 y: 47; 18-54 y: 28; â¥55 y: 59) were vaccinated recombinant hepatitis B vaccine as control group. Immunogenicity end points were based on the European licensure criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines. Results The persistence of HI immune response against the vaccine strain was assessed through GMT. The immunogenicity of the Aleph influenza vaccine induced all reached the standards at 1(st) month and GMTs peak could persist at least up to 3(rd) month. (This study has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov under registration no. NCT01758185.) Because of the local spring influenza epidemic we could not analyze the results of 6(th) and 12(th) month. Conclusions Aleph influenza vaccines showed good immune persistence in healthy volunteers at least in the three months after vaccination.


Title #188: The Influence of Structure and Processing on the Behavior of TiO2 Protective Layers for Stabilization of n-Si/TiO2/Ni Photoanodes for Water Oxidation.
PMID: 26083827
Authors: Matthew T MT. McDowell, Michael F MF. Lichterman, Azhar I AI. Carim, Rui R. Liu, Shu S. Hu, Bruce S BS. Brunschwig, Nathan S NS. Lewis
Abstract: Light absorbers with moderate band gaps (1-2 eV) are required for high-efficiency solar fuels devices, but most semiconducting photoanodes undergo photocorrosion or passivation in aqueous solution. Amorphous TiO2 deposited by atomic-layer deposition (ALD) onto various n-type semiconductors (Si, GaAs, GaP, and CdTe) and coated with thin films or islands of Ni produces efficient, stable photoanodes for water oxidation, with the TiO2 films protecting the underlying semiconductor from photocorrosion in pH = 14 KOH(aq). The links between the electronic properties of the TiO2 in these electrodes and the structure and energetic defect states of the material are not yet well-elucidated. We show herein that TiO2 films with a variety of crystal structures and mid-gap defect state distributions, deposited using both ALD and sputtering, form rectifying junctions with n-Si and are highly conductive towards photogenerated carriers in n-Si/TiO2/Ni photoanodes. Moreover, the photovoltage of these electrodes can be modified by annealing the TiO2 in reducing or oxidizing environments. All of the polycrystalline TiO2 films with compact grain boundaries investigated herein protected the n-Si photoanodes against photocorrosion in pH = 14 KOH(aq). Hence, in these devices conduction through the TiO2 layer is neither specific to a particular amorphous or crystalline structure nor determined wholly by a particular extrinsic dopant impurity. The coupled structural and energetic properties of TiO2, and potentially other protective oxides, can therefore be controlled to yield optimized photoelectrode performance.

We aimed to determine whether Emergency Medical Service (EMS)-related ambulance team process measures correlate with patient survival.


Title #190: Phytoremedial Potential of Typha latifolia, Eichornia crassipes and Monochoria hastata found in Contaminated Water Bodies Across Ranchi City (India).
PMID: 26083824
Authors: Moushumi M. Hazra, Kirti K. Avishek, Gopal G. Pathak
Abstract: Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses green plants (living machines) for removal of contaminants of concern (COC). These plant species have the potential to remove the COC, thereby restoring the original condition of soil or water environment. The present study focuses on assessing the heavy metals (COC) present in the contaminated water bodies of Ranchi city, Jharkhand, India. Phytoremedial potential of three plant species: Typha latifolia, Eichornia crassipes and Monochoria hastata were assessed in the present study. Heterogenous accumulation of metals was found in the three plant species. It was observed that the ratio of heavy metal concentration was different in different parts, i.e., shoots and roots. Positive results were also obtained for translocation factor of all species with minimum of 0.10 and maximum of 1. It was found experimentally that M. hastata has the maximum BFC for root as 4.32 and shoot as 2.70 (for Manganese). For T. latifolia, BCF of maximum was observed for root (163.5) and respective shoot 86.46 (for Iron), followed by 7.3 and 5.8 for root and shoot (for Manganese) respectively. E. crassipes was found to possess a maximum BCF of 278.6 (for Manganese and 151 (for Iron) and shoot as 142 (for Manganese) and 36.13 (for Iron).


Title #191: The incidence and economic impact of the Escherichia coli peritonitis syndrome in Dutch poultry farming.
PMID: 26083823
Authors: W J M WJ. Landman, J H H JH. van Eck
Abstract: The incidence and economic impact of the Escherichia coli peritonitis syndrome (EPS) characterized by acute mortality, were estimated in chicken eggs producing farms in the Netherlands in 2013. The incidence was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the meat-sector (35% affected farms) compared to the layer-sector (7% affected farms). In consumption eggs producing farms EPS occurred on 12% of the free range and organic farms, while it was found on 1% and 4% of the cage and barn farms, respectively. Data from four layer and two broiler breeder flocks with EPS were used to estimate the overall economic impact of the disease. Mean numbers of eggs lost were 10 and 11 per hen housed (phh), while mean slaughter weight loss was 0.2 kg and 0.5 kg phh in the four layer and two broiler breeder flocks, respectively. Total losses including costs of destruction of dead hens, compensated for reduced feed intake due to a smaller flock size, ranged from â¬ 0.28 phh (cage farms) to â¬ 9.75 phh (grandparent farms) in the layer-sector and from â¬ 1.87 phh (parent farms) to â¬ 10.73 phh (grandparent farms) in the meat-sector. Antibiotics against EPS were given often and repeatedly especially in the meat-sector. Including the costs of antibiotics, total losses were estimated at â¬ 0.4 million, â¬ 3.3 million and â¬ 3.7 million for the layer-sector, the meat-sector and poultry farming as a whole, respectively. Research focusing on the prevention and treatment of EPS is justified by its severe clinical and economic impact.

Title #199: Wheat NF-YA10 functions independently in salinity and drought stress.
PMID: 26083807
Authors: Xiaoyan X. Ma, Chunlong C. Li, Mei M. Wang
Abstract: The transcription factor NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) plays an essential role in many developmental and stress-responsive processes in plants. NF-Y composed of 3 subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, targets the CCAAT box, a common cis-element in eukaryotic promoters. We recently identified a gene TaNF-YA10-1 from the wheat salinity tolerant cultivar SR3 and found that recombinant TaNF-YA10-1 could successfully bind to the CCAAT motif in vitro. We also showed that the constitutive expression of TaNF-YA10-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly increased the plant's sensitivity to salinity. Here, we further demonstrated that TaNF-YA10-1 -overexpressing plants conferred drought tolerance as judged from the relative root length and whole-plant growth under drought stress. These results suggest that TaNF-YA10-1 functions independently in salinity and drought stress. Our findings are helpful in understanding the distinct roles of NF-YA in plant stress responses.


Title #200: Two-Dimensional Algal Collection and Assembly by Combining AC-Dielectrophoresis with Fluorescence Detection for Contaminant-Induced Oxidative Stress Sensing.
PMID: 26083806
Authors: Coralie C. Siebman, Orlin D OD. Velev, Vera I VI. Slaveykova
Abstract: An alternative current (AC) dielectrophoretic lab-on-chip setup was evaluated as a rapid tool of capture and assembly of microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in two-dimensional (2D) close-packed arrays. An electric field of 100 VÂ·cm-1, 100 Hz applied for 30 min was found optimal to collect and assemble the algae into single-layer structures of closely packed cells without inducing cellular oxidative stress. Combined with oxidative stress specific staining and fluorescence microscopy detection, the capability of using the 2D whole-cell assembly on-chip to follow the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress during short-term exposure to several environmental contaminants, including mercury, methylmercury, copper, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs), and diuron was explored. The results showed significant increase of the cellular ROS when C. reinhardtii was exposed to high concentrations of methylmercury, CuO-NPs, and 10-5 M Cu. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of combining AC-dielectrophoretically assembled two-dimensional algal structures with cell metabolic analysis using fluorescence staining, as a rapid analytical tool for probing the effect of contaminants in highly impacted environment.

PMID: 26083804
Authors: M. M. Donarelli, F. F. Perrozzi, F. F. Bisti, F. F. Paparella, V. V. Feyer, A. A. Ponzoni, M. M. Gonchigsuren, L. L. Ottaviano
Abstract: A novel technique to lithograph the MoS2 surface is described here. Mechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes have been patterned with an atomic force microscope tip. After the patterning process, the lithographed areas have been removed by selective chemical etching. The electronic properties of the MoS2 flakes have been analyzed with spatially resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, with tunable incident photon energy, provided by a synchrotron light source. Tens of meV core level shifts can be recorded in relation to the flakes edges, coming from both the exfoliation and from the lithography.


Title #202: Peromyscus mice as a model for studying natural variation.
PMID: 26083802
Authors: Nicole L NL. Bedford, Hopi E HE. Hoekstra
Abstract: The deer mouse (genus Peromyscus) is the most abundant mammal in North America, and it occupies almost every type of terrestrial habitat. It is not surprising therefore that the natural history of Peromyscus is among the best studied of any small mammal. For decades, the deer mouse has contributed to our understanding of population genetics, disease ecology, longevity, endocrinology and behavior. Over a century's worth of detailed descriptive studies of Peromyscus in the wild, coupled with emerging genetic and genomic techniques, have now positioned these mice as model organisms for the study of natural variation and adaptation. Recent work, combining field observations and laboratory experiments, has lead to exciting advances in a number of fields-from evolution and genetics, to physiology and neurobiology.


Title #203: Biological Significance and Applications of Heme c Proteins and Peptides.
PMID: 26083801
Authors: Jesse G JG. Kleingardner, Kara L KL. Bren
Abstract: Hemes are ubiquitous in biology and carry out a wide range of functions. The heme group is largely invariant across proteins with different functions, although there are a few variations seen in nature. The most common variant is heme c, which is formed by a post-translational modification in which heme is covalently linked to two Cys residues on the polypeptide via thioether bonds. In this Account, the influence of this covalent attachment on heme c properties and function is discussed, and examples of how covalent attachment has been used in selected applications are presented. Proteins that bind heme c are among the most well-characterized proteins in biochemistry. Most of these proteins are cytochromes c (cyts c) that serve as electron carriers in photosynthesis and respiration. Despite the intense study of cyts c, the functional significance of heme covalent attachment has remained elusive. One observation is that heme c reaches a lower reduction potential in nature than its noncovalently linked counterpart, heme b, when comparing proteins with the same axial ligands. Furthermore, covalent attachment is known to enhance protein stability and allow the heme to be relatively solvent exposed. However, an inorganic chemistry perspective on the effects of covalent attachment has been lacking. Spectroscopic measurements and computations on cyts c and model systems reveal a number of effects of covalent attachment on heme electronic structure and reactivity. One is that the predominant nonplanar ruffling distortion seen in heme c lowers heme reduction potential. Another is that covalent attachment influences the interaction of the heme iron with the proximal His ligand. Heme ruffling also has been shown to influence electronic coupling to redox partners and, therefore, electron transfer rates by altering the distribution of the orbital hole on the porphyrin in oxidized cyt c. Another consequence of heme covalent attachment is the strong vibrational coupling seen between the iron and the protein surface as revealed by nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy studies. Finally, heme covalent attachment is proposed to be an important feature supporting multiple roles of cyt c in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Heme covalent attachment is not only vital for the biological functions of cyt c but also provides a useful handle in a number of applications. For one, the engineering of heme c onto an exposed portion of a protein of interest has been shown to provide a visible affinity purification tag. In addition, peptides with covalently attached heme, known as microperoxidases, have been studied as model compounds and oxidation catalysts and, more recently, in applications for energy conversion and storage. The wealth of insight gained about heme c through fundamental studies of cyts c forms a basis for future efforts toward engineering natural and artificial cytochromes for a variety of applications.


Title #204: Impaired responsiveness of platelets to epinephrine due to Î±2A adrenoreceptor deficiency in Male Chinese.
PMID: 26083800
Authors: Tsun-Mei TM. Lin, Jih-Shyan JS. Lin, Jen-Yu JY. Tseng, Shang-Yin SY. Wu, Tsai-Yun TY. Chen
Abstract: Epinephrine is known as a weak, but important, agonist for platelet activation. It has been reported that the responsiveness of platelets to epinephrine was markedly impaired in 6% of Caucasians and in 16% of Japanese. The purpose of this study was to screen and characterize this abnormality in healthy Taiwanese Chinese volunteers. We used aggregometry, flow cytometry and platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 system to assess in 50 healthy male volunteers the responsiveness of platelets to epinephrine stimulation. Using Î±2A adrenoceptor antagonist BRL44408 maleate competition and a [(3)H]yohimbin binding assay, we evaluated Î±2A adrenoceptors on platelets. The aggregation of platelets after stimulation with 10âÎ¼M of epinephrine indicated two distinct groups of study participants: 24 (48.0%) good- and 26 (52.0%) impaired-responders to epinephrine. Flow cytometric analysis of platelets after stimulated with 1âÎ¼M epinephrine showed that glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa and P-selectin expression of epinephrine good- and impaired-responders were 27.1âÂ±â11.0% vs. 9.9âÂ±â5.4% (pâ=â0.003) and 12.2âÂ±â6.2% vs. 3.6âÂ±â3.5% (pâ<â0.001), respectively. The PFA-100 system showed that epinephrine-impaired-responders had a longer collagen-epinephrine induced closure time. Good-responder platelets incubated with BRL44408 maleate had an impaired response to epinephrine stimulation. [(3)H]yohimbine binding studies showed fewer Î±2A adrenoreceptors on the platelets of epinephrine-impaired-responders than on those of good-responders. The prevalence of impaired responsiveness to epinephrine was high and probably due to Î±2A adrenoreceptor deficiency in male Taiwanese Chinese.

Title #211: On-surface polymerization on a semiconducting oxide: aryl halide coupling controlled by surface hydroxyl groups on rutile TiO2(011).
PMID: 26083792
Authors: Marek M. Kolmer, Rafal R. Zuzak, Amir A AA. Ahmad Zebari, Szymon S. Godlewski, Jakub S JS. Prauzner-Bechcicki, Witold W. Piskorz, Filip F. Zasada, Zbigniew Z. Sojka, David D. BlÃ©ger, Stefan S. Hecht, Marek M. Szymonski
Abstract: Based on scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we show that the covalent coupling of aryl halide monomers on the rutile TiO2(011)-(2 Ã 1) surface is controlled by the density of surface hydroxyl groups. The efficiency of the polymerization reaction depends on the level of surface hydroxylation, but the presence of hydroxyl groups is also essential for the reaction to occur.

Abstract: Harlequin ichthyosis is a rare, severe form of congenital ichthyosis characterised by distinct physical appearance of the infant. It has occurrence of 1 in 1 million births and over 100 cases have been reported so far. It is caused by mutation in ABCA12 gene involved in lipid transport leading to profound thickening of stratum corneum. The mainstay of management relies on supportive care & administration of retinoid derivatives. Outcome is usually fatal and most of the babies die during neonatal period. In this article, we report a case of harlequin baby born of non-consanguineous marriage with history of chicken pox in the mother during first trimester of pregnancy.


Title #213: Racial Differences in Adolescents' Answering Questions about Suicide.
PMID: 26083790
Authors: Laura M LM. Anderson, Lynda S LS. Lowry, Karl L KL. Wuensch
Abstract: The present purpose was to examine racial differences in response rate and serious behavioral suicide risk based on the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS). Data from 15,245 adolescents (YRBS 2011) were included. Survey items pertaining to making suicidal plans and attempting suicide were included. Significant differences in responding and content emerged, especially with regard to suicide attempts. Racial minority adolescents are at elevated risk for serious suicidal behaviors and are more likely to omit items pertaining to suicide attempts. African American adolescents rarely reported having attempted suicide, but they also frequently failed to respond to that question.

Title #217: Study of behavioural and neural bases of visuo-spatial working memory with an fMRI paradigm based on an n-back task.
PMID: 26083786
Authors: Artemisa R AR. Dores, Fernando F. Barbosa, Irene P IP. Carvalho, Isabel I. Almeida, Sandra S. Guerreiro, Benedita M BM. da Rocha, Liliana L. de Sousa, Alexandre A. Castro-Caldas
Abstract: The goal of this study was to propose a new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm using a language-free adaptation of a 2-back working memory task to avoid cultural and educational bias. We additionally provide an index of the validity of the proposed paradigm and test whether the experimental task discriminates the behavioural performances of healthy participants from those of individuals with working memory deficits. Ten healthy participants and nine patients presenting working memory (WM) deficits due to acquired brain injury (ABI) performed the developed task. To inspect whether the paradigm activates brain areas typically involved in visual working memory (VWM), brain activation of the healthy participants was assessed with fMRIs. To examine the task's capacity to discriminate behavioural data, performances of the healthy participants in the task were compared with those of ABI patients. Data were analysed with GLM-based random effects procedures and t-tests. We found an increase of the BOLD signal in the specialized areas of VWM. Concerning behavioural performances, healthy participants showed the predicted pattern of more hits, less omissions and a tendency for fewer false alarms, more self-corrected responses, and faster reaction times, when compared with subjects presenting WM impairments. The results suggest that this task activates brain areas involved in VWM and discriminates behavioural performances of clinical and non-clinical groups. It can thus be used as a research methodology for behavioural and neuroimaging studies of VWM in block-design paradigms.


Title #218: The Causative Gene in Chanarian Dorfman Syndrome Regulates Lipid Droplet Homeostasis in C. elegans.
PMID: 26083785
Authors: Meng M. Xie, Richard R. Roy
Abstract: AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of many cellular mechanisms required for adjustment to various stresses induced by the changing environment. In C. elegans dauer larvae AMPK-null mutants expire prematurely due to hyperactive Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL-1) followed by rapid depletion of triglyceride stores. We found that the compromise of one of the three C. elegans orthologues of human cgi-58 significantly improves the survival of AMPK-deficient dauers. We also provide evidence that C. elegans CGI-58 acts as a co-activator of ATGL-1, while it also functions cooperatively to maintain regular lipid droplet structure. Surprisingly, we show that it also acts independently of ATGL-1 to restrict lipid droplet coalescence by altering the surface abundance and composition of long chain (C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Our data reveal a novel structural role of CGI-58 in maintaining lipid droplet homeostasis through its effects on droplet composition, morphology and lipid hydrolysis; a conserved function that may account for some of the ATGL-1-independent features unique to Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome.


Title #219: Inhibition of hydroxyapatite growth by casein, a potential salivary phosphoprotein homologue.
PMID: 26083784

Abstract: Salivary phosphoproteins are essential in tooth mineral regulation but are often overlooked inÂ vitro. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of casein, as a salivary phosphoprotein homologue, on the deposition and growth of hydroxyapatite (HA) on tooth surfaces. Hydroxyapatite growth was quantified using seeded crystal systems. Artificial saliva (AS) containing HA powder and 0, 10, 20, 50, or 100Â Î¼gÂ ml(-1) of casein, or 100Â Î¼gÂ ml(-1) of dephosphorylated casein (Dcasein), was incubated for 0-8Â h at 37Â°C, pH 7.2. Calcium concentrations were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Surface precipitation of HA on bovine enamel and dentine blocks, incubated in similar conditions for 7Â d, was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Casein adsorption was assessed using modified Lowry assays and zeta-potential measurements. The AAS results revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of calcium consumption. Hydroxyapatite precipitation occurred when no casein was present, whereas precipitation of HA was apparently completely inhibited in casein-containing groups. Adsorption data demonstrated increasingly negative zeta-potential with increased casein concentration and an affinity constant similar to proline-rich proteins with Langmuir modelling. Casein inhibited the deposition and growth of HA primarily through the binding of esterized phosphate to HA active sites, indicating its potential as a mineral-regulating salivary phosphoprotein homologue inÂ vitro.


Title #220: Emulsion/surface Interactions From Quiescent Quartz Crystal Microbalance Measurements With An Inverted Sensor.
PMID: 26083783
Authors: Roozbeh R. Mafi, Robert H RH. Pelton
Abstract: Interactions of three oil-in-water emulsion types with polystyrene-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor surfaces were probed with the QCM cell in both the conventional orientation (i.e. polystyrene surface on the bottom, "looking up") and in the inverted orientation (polystyrene on top interior surface of sensor chamber, "looking down"). With the conventionally oriented QCM sensors, the adsorption of soluble and/or dispersed species quickly gave steady-state frequency and dissipation outputs. By contrast, the inverted sensors gave changing responses at long times because of the gravity driven build-up of a viscous consolidation layer next to, but not necessarily bound to, the sensor surface. Three emulsion types (a simple hexadecane/phosphatidylcholine emulsion; 2% homogenized milk; and a diluted commercial ophthalmic emulsion) displayed a wide range of behaviors. We propose that quiescent QCM measurement made with an inverted sample chamber is a new approach to probing emulsion behaviors near solid surfaces.


Title #221: Biomarkers in Cardiology - Part 2: In Coronary Heart Disease, Valve Disease and Special Situations.
PMID: 26083777
Authors: 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the main causes of mortality and morbidity in Brazil. Their primary and secondary preventions are a priority for the health system and require multiple approaches for increased effectiveness. Biomarkers are tools used to identify with greater accuracy high-risk individuals, establish a faster diagnosis, guide treatment, and determine prognosis. This review aims to highlight the importance of biomarkers in clinical cardiology practice and raise relevant points regarding their application and perspectives for the next few years. This document was divided into two parts. This second part addresses the application of biomarkers in coronary heart disease, valvular diseases, cardio-oncology, pulmonary embolism, and cardiorenal syndrome.


Title #222: Downregulation of CXCR4 in Metastasized Breast Cancer Cells and Implication in Their Dormancy.
PMID: 26083776

Abstract: Our understanding of the mechanism of cancer dormancy is emerging, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we analyzed mouse xenograft tumors derived from human breast cancer tissue and the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to identify the molecules associated with cancer dormancy. In immunohistological examination using the proliferation marker Ki-67, the tumors included both proliferating and dormant cancer cells, but the number of dormant cells was remarkably increased when they metastasized to the lung. In the gene expression analysis of the orthotopic cancer cells by a single-cell multiplex real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR followed by flow cytometric analysis, restrained cellular proliferation was associated with downregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. In the immunohistological and flow cytometric analyses, the expression level of CXCR4 in the metastasized cancer cells was decreased compared with that in the cancer cells in orthotopic tumors, although the expression level of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 was not reduced in the lung. In addition, the proliferation of the metastasized cancer cells was further decreased by the CXCR4 antagonist administration. In the ex vivo culture of the metastasized cancer cells, the expression level of CXCR4 was increased, and in the xenotransplantation of ex vivo cultured cancer cells, the expression level of CXCR4 was again decreased in the metastasized cancer cells in the lung. These findings indicate that CXCR4 is downregulated in metastasized breast cancer cells and implicated in their dormancy.


Title #223: Tandem Regioselective Substitution and Palladium-Catalyzed Ring Fusion Reaction for Core-Expanded Boron Dipyrromethenes with Red-Shifted Absorption and Intense Fluorescence.
PMID: 26083775
Authors: Lijuan L. Jiao, Xin X. Zhou, Qinghua Q. Wu, Yuanmei Y. Feng, Yang Y. Yu, Changjiang C. Yu, Erhong E. Hao, Yun Y. Wei, Xiaolong X. Mu
Abstract: Here we report a selective method for the core-extension of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) with two annulated indole rings with exclusive syn-connectivity based on a regioselective necleophilic substuition reaction of 2,3,5,6-tetrabromoBODIPY with arylamins, followed by palladium-catalyzed intramolecular C-C coupling ring fusion. The unsymmetrical core-expanded BODIPY with annulated indole and benzofuran rings was also synthesized by stepwise and regioselective necleophilic substuition and palladium-catalyzed intramolecular C-C coupling rection. The diindole-annulated BODIPY was unambiguously characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The optical properties of the present core-expanded BODIPYs were studied, revealing clearly red-shifted absorption and emission bands and enhanced absorption coefficients upon annulation.


Title #224: Ultra-low noise miniaturized neural amplifier with hardware averaging.
PMID: 26083774
Authors: Yazan M YM. Dweiri, Thomas T. Eggers, Grant G. McCallum, Dominique M DM. Durand
Abstract: Peripheral nerves carry neural signals that could be used to control hybrid bionic systems. Cuff electrodes provide a robust and stable interface but the recorded signal amplitude is small (<3 Î¼Vrms 700 Hz-7 kHz), thereby requiring a baseline noise of less than 1 Î¼Vrms for a useful signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) contacts alone generate thermal noise of at least 0.5 Î¼Vrms therefore the amplifier should add as little noise as possible. Since mainstream neural amplifiers have a baseline noise of 2 Î¼Vrms or higher, novel designs are required.

PMID: 26083773
Authors: Luisa L. Soares-Miranda, Fumiaki F. Imamura, David D. Siscovick, Nancy Swords NS. Jenny, Annette L AL. Fitzpatrick, Dariush D. Mozaffarian
Abstract: The influence of physical activity (PA) and physical fitness (PF) at older ages on changes in telomere length (TL), repetitive DNA sequences that may mark biologic aging, is not well-established. Few prior studies have been conducted in older adults, these were mainly cross-sectional, and few evaluated PF.

Authors: Takashi T. Tarumi, Mitzi M MM. Gonzales, Bennett B. Fallow, Nantinee N. Nualnim, Jeongseok J. Lee, Martha M. Pyron, Hirofumi H. Tanaka, Andreana P AP. Haley
Abstract: Midlife vascular disease risk is associated with higher incidence of cognitive impairment in late life. Regular aerobic exercise improves vascular function, which in turn may translate into better cognitive function. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations among cardiorespiratory fitness, cerebral and peripheral vascular reactivity, and cognitive function in the sedentary and endurance-trained middle-aged adults.

Abstract: For the first time, we investigated the effects of altering cellular metabolic capacitance, via a 5-day creatine (Cr) loading protocol (20 gÂ·day), on oxygen uptake (VËO2), accumulated oxygen deficit, muscle recruitment, and performance during a 1-km cycling time-trial.


Title #228: Discontinued drug therapies to treat diabetes in 2014.
PMID: 26083770
Authors: Jerry R JR. Colca
Abstract: Available drugs partially attenuate the hyperglycemia characteristic of diabetes. However, successful approaches to treat the root cause or to cure or prevent diabetes remain elusive. Drug discovery and development programs continue to focus on mechanisms that impact specific symptoms of diabetes. In 2014, programs were discontinued for a variety of reasons and these discontinued programs are discussed herein. Areas covered: A search of discontinued products in the metabolic area for 2014 identified mostly compounds that were being developed to treat diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes). Candidates were identified through the use of PharmaProjects. The author also sought information using Google, PubMed, HighWire and ClinicalTrials.gov. The discontinued development programs that were identified were not numerous as in previous years and so they are presented here without segregation into categories. Expert opinion: In general, the specific reasons for the discontinuation of these programs have not been clearly disclosed. In some cases, business considerations are given, whereas in others, there are specific safety issues that emerged which were not expected from nonclinical experience. In the final analysis, it is clear that all of these programs have been discontinued because the evidence does not favor the type of efficacy and risk:benefit ratio that justifies additional expenditures. There remains a clear need for precise addressable mechanisms to affect the root causes of diabetes.


Title #229: Pes Anserine Bursitis in Symptomatic Osteoarthritis Patients: A Mesotherapy Treatment Study.
PMID: 26083769
Authors: Raoul R. Saggini, Alexandra A. Di Stefano, Ira I. Dodaj, Laura L. Scarcello, Rosa Grazia RG. Bellomo
Abstract: Pes anserine bursitis strongly affects quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis. Treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy, and injections of corticosteroid, with highly variable responses; recovery can take 10 days to 36 months. Mesotherapy is a minimally invasive technique consisting of subcutaneous injections of bioactive substances. The goal is to modulate the pharmacokinetics of the injected substance and prolong the effects at a local level.


Title #230: Association between Intraoperative Hypotension and Hypertension and 30-day Postoperative Mortality in Noncardiac Surgery.
PMID: 26083768
Authors: Terri G TG. Monk, Michael R MR. Bronsert, William G WG. Henderson, Michael P MP. Mangione, S T John T ST. Sum-Ping, Deyne R DR. Bentt, Jennifer D JD. Nguyen, Joshua S JS. Richman, Robert A RA. Meguid, Karl E KE. Hammermeister
Abstract: Although deviations in intraoperative blood pressure are assumed to be associated with postoperative mortality, critical blood pressure thresholds remain undefined. Therefore, the authors estimated the intraoperative thresholds of systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MAP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with increased risk-adjusted 30-day mortality.


Title #231: Different Approaches to Ultrasound-guided Thoracic Paravertebral Block: An Illustrated Review.
PMID: 26083767
Authors: Annelot C AC. Krediet, Nizar N. Moayeri, Geert-Jan GJ. van Geffen, JÃ¶rgen J. Bruhn, Steven S. Renes, Paul E PE. Bigeleisen, Gerbrand J GJ. Groen
Abstract: Given the fast development and increasing clinical relevance of ultrasound guidance for thoracic paravertebral blockade, this review article strives (1) to provide comprehensive information on thoracic paravertebral space anatomy, tailored to the needs of a regional anesthesia practitioner, (2) to interpret ultrasound images of the thoracic paravertebral space using cross-sectional anatomical images that are matched in location and plane, and (3) to briefly describe and discuss different ultrasound-guided approaches to thoracic paravertebral blockade. To illustrate the pertinent anatomy, high-resolution photographs of anatomical cross-sections are used. By using voxel anatomy, it is possible to visualize the needle pathway of different approaches in the same human specimen. This offers a unique presentation of this complex anatomical region and is inherently more realistic than anatomical drawings.


Title #232: Improvement of the Cycling Performance and Thermal Stability of Lithium-Ion Cells by Double-Layer Coating of Cathode Materials with Al2O3 Nanoparticles and Conductive Polymer.
PMID: 26083766
Authors: Yoon-Sung YS. Lee, Won-Kyung WK. Shin, Aravindaraj G AG. Kannan, Sang Man SM. Koo, Dong-Won DW. Kim
Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of dual-layer coating of cathode active materials for improving the cycling performance and thermal stability of lithium-ion cells. Layered nickel-rich LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode material was synthesized and double-layer coated with alumina nanoparticles and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-co-poly(ethylene glycol). The lithium-ion cells assembled with a graphite negative electrode and a double-layer-coated LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 positive electrode exhibited high discharge capacity, good cycling stability, and improved rate capability. The protective double layer formed on the surface of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 materials effectively inhibited the dissolution of Ni, Co, and Mn metals from cathode active materials and improved thermal stability by suppressing direct contact between electrolyte solution and delithiated Li1-xNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 materials. This effective design strategy can be adopted to enhance the cycling performance and thermal stability of other layered nickel-rich cathode materials used in lithium-ion batteries.


Title #233: Good Liars Are Neither 'Dark' Nor Self-Deceptive.
PMID: 26083765
Authors: Gordon R T GR. Wright, Christopher J CJ. Berry, Caroline C. Catmur, Geoffrey G. Bird
Abstract: Deception is a central component of the personality 'Dark Triad' (Machiavellianism, Psychopathy and Narcissism). However, whether individuals exhibiting high scores on Dark Triad measures have a heightened deceptive ability has received little experimental attention. The present study tested whether the ability to lie effectively, and to detect lies told by others, was related to Dark Triad, Lie Acceptability, or Self-Deceptive measures of personality using an interactive group-based deception task. At a group level, lie detection accuracy was correlated with the ability to deceive others-replicating previous work. No evidence was found to suggest that Dark Triad traits confer any advantage either to deceive others, or to detect deception in others. Participants who considered lying to be more acceptable were more skilled at lying, while self-deceptive individuals were generally less credible and less confident when lying. Results are interpreted within a framework in which repeated practice results in enhanced deceptive ability.

Title #235: Infection of an Insect Vector with a Bacterial Plant Pathogen Increases Its Propensity for Dispersal.
PMID: 26083763
Authors: Xavier X. Martini, Mark M. Hoffmann, Monique R MR. Coy, Lukasz L LL. Stelinski, Kirsten S KS. Pelz-Stelinski
Abstract: The spread of vector-transmitted pathogens relies on complex interactions between host, vector and pathogen. In sessile plant pathosystems, the spread of a pathogen highly depends on the movement and mobility of the vector. However, questions remain as to whether and how pathogen-induced vector manipulations may affect the spread of a plant pathogen. Here we report for the first time that infection with a bacterial plant pathogen increases the probability of vector dispersal, and that such movement of vectors is likely manipulated by a bacterial plant pathogen. We investigated how Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) affects dispersal behavior, flight capacity, and the sexual attraction of its vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). CLas is the putative causal agent of huanglongbing (HLB), which is a disease that threatens the viability of commercial citrus production worldwide. When D. citri developed on CLas-infected plants, short distance dispersal of male D. citri was greater compared to counterparts reared on uninfected plants. Flight by CLas-infected D. citri was initiated earlier and long flight events were more common than by uninfected psyllids, as measured by a flight mill apparatus. Additionally, CLas titers were higher among psyllids that performed long flights than psyllid that performed short flights. Finally, attractiveness of female D. citri that developed on infected plants to male conspecifics increased proportionally with increasing CLas bacterial titers measured within female psyllids. Our study indicates that the phytopathogen, CLas, may manipulate movement and mate selection behavior of their vectors, which is a possible evolved mechanism to promote their own spread. These results have global implications for both current HLB models of disease spread and control strategies.

Title #237: Bifidobacterium breve alters immune function and ameliorates DSS-induced inflammation in weanling rats.
PMID: 26083761
Authors: Hirohisa H. Izumi, Mario M. Minegishi, Yohei Y. Sato, Takashi T. Shimizu, Kazunori K. Sekine, Mitsunori M. Takase
Abstract: Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (M16V) is a probiotic bacterial strain with a long tradition of use in NICUs in some countries. Previous study showed that the effects of M16V administration on gene expression were greater during the weaning period than in the neonatal period and were greater in the colon than in the small intestine and spleen, suggesting that M16V has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects of inflammation during the weaning period and the effects of M16V on normal and inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: The basal ganglia are vulnerable to injury during cardiac arrest. Movement disorders are a common morbidity in survivors. Yet, neuronal motor network changes post-arrest remain poorly understood.


Title #239: A modular approach to intensity-modulated arc therapy optimization with noncoplanar trajectories.
PMID: 26083759
Authors: DÃ¡vid D. Papp, Thomas T. Bortfeld, Jan J. Unkelbach
Abstract: Utilizing noncoplanar beam angles in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has the potential to combine the benefits of arc therapy, such as short treatment times, with the benefits of noncoplanar intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans, such as improved organ sparing. Recently, vendors introduced treatment machines that allow for simultaneous couch and gantry motion during beam delivery to make noncoplanar VMAT treatments possible. Our aim is to provide a reliable optimization method for noncoplanar isocentric arc therapy plan optimization. The proposed solution is modular in the sense that it can incorporate different existing beam angle selection and coplanar arc therapy optimization methods.Treatment planning is performed in three steps. First, a number of promising noncoplanar beam directions are selected using an iterative beam selection heuristic; these beams serve as anchor points of the arc therapy trajectory. In the second step, continuous gantry/couch angle trajectories are optimized using a simple combinatorial optimization model to define a beam trajectory that efficiently visits each of the anchor points. Treatment time is controlled by limiting the time the beam needs to trace the prescribed trajectory. In the third and final step, an optimal arc therapy plan is found along the prescribed beam trajectory. In principle any existing arc therapy optimization method could be incorporated into this step; for this work we use a sliding window VMAT algorithm.The approach is demonstrated using two particularly challenging cases. The first one is a lung SBRT patient whose planning goals could not be satisfied with fewer than nine noncoplanar IMRT fields when the patient was treated in the clinic. The second one is a brain tumor patient, where the target volume overlaps with the optic nerves and the chiasm and it is directly adjacent to the brainstem.Both cases illustrate that the large number of angles utilized by isocentric noncoplanar VMAT plans can help improve dose conformity, homogeneity, and organ sparing simultaneously using the same beam trajectory length and delivery time as a coplanar VMAT plan.


Title #240: Miocene Fossils Reveal Ancient Roots for New Zealand's Endemic Mystacina (Chiroptera) and Its Rainforest Habitat.
PMID: 26083758

Abstract: The New Zealand endemic bat family Mystacinidae comprises just two Recent species referred to a single genus, Mystacina. The family was once more diverse and widespread, with an additional six extinct taxa recorded from Australia and New Zealand. Here, a new mystacinid is described from the early Miocene (19-16 Ma) St Bathans Fauna of Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand. It is the first pre-Pleistocene record of the modern genus and it extends the evolutionary history of Mystacina back at least 16 million years. Extant Mystacina species occupy old-growth rainforest and are semi-terrestrial with an exceptionally broad omnivorous diet. The majority of the plants inhabited, pollinated, dispersed or eaten by modern Mystacina were well-established in southern New Zealand in the early Miocene, based on the fossil record from sites at or near where the bat fossils are found. Similarly, many of the arthropod prey of living Mystacina are recorded as fossils in the same area. Although none of the Miocene plant and arthropod species is extant, most are closely related to modern taxa, demonstrating potentially long-standing ecological associations with Mystacina.


Title #241: Spatiotemporal control of a novel synaptic organizer molecule.
PMID: 26083757
Authors: Kelly K. Howell, John G JG. White, Oliver O. Hobert
Abstract: Synapse formation is a process tightly controlled in space and time. How gene regulatory mechanisms specify spatial and temporal aspects of synapse formation is not well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two subtypes of the D-type inhibitory motor neuron (MN) classes, the dorsal D (DD) and ventral D (VD) neurons, extend axons along both the dorsal and ventral nerve cords. The embryonically generated DD motor neurons initially innervate ventral muscles in the first (L1) larval stage and receive their synaptic input from cholinergic motor neurons in the dorsal cord. They rewire by the end of the L1 moult to innervate dorsal muscles and to be innervated by newly formed ventral cholinergic motor neurons. VD motor neurons develop after the L1 moult; they take over the innervation of ventral muscles and receive their synaptic input from dorsal cholinergic motor neurons. We show here that the spatiotemporal control of synaptic wiring of the D-type neurons is controlled by an intersectional transcriptional strategy in which the UNC-30 Pitx-type homeodomain transcription factor acts together, in embryonic and early larval stages, with the temporally controlled LIN-14 transcription factor to prevent premature synapse rewiring of the DD motor neurons and, together with the UNC-55 nuclear hormone receptor, to prevent aberrant VD synaptic wiring in later larval and adult stages. A key effector of this intersectional transcription factor combination is a novel synaptic organizer molecule, the single immunoglobulin domain protein OIG-1. OIG-1 is perisynaptically localized along the synaptic outputs of the D-type motor neurons in a temporally controlled manner and is required for appropriate selection of both pre- and post-synaptic partners.


Title #242: Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles of regulatory variation.

Authors: Jason D JD. Buenrostro, Beijing B. Wu, Ulrike M UM. Litzenburger, Dave D. Ruff, Michael L ML. Gonzales, Michael P MP. Snyder, Howard Y HY. Chang, William J WJ. Greenleaf
Abstract: Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.


Title #243: Unusual biology across a group comprising more than 15% of domain Bacteria.

Abstract: A prominent feature of the bacterial domain is a radiation of major lineages that are defined as candidate phyla because they lack isolated representatives. Bacteria from these phyla occur in diverse environments and are thought to mediate carbon and hydrogen cycles. Genomic analyses of a few representatives suggested that metabolic limitations have prevented their cultivation. Here we reconstructed 8 complete and 789 draft genomes from bacteria representing >35 phyla and documented features that consistently distinguish these organisms from other bacteria. We infer that this group, which may comprise >15% of the bacterial domain, has shared evolutionary history, and describe it as the candidate phyla radiation (CPR). All CPR genomes are small and most lack numerous biosynthetic pathways. Owing to divergent 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, 50-100% of organisms sampled from specific phyla would evade detection in typical cultivation-independent surveys. CPR organisms often have self-splicing introns and proteins encoded within their rRNA genes, a feature rarely reported in bacteria. Furthermore, they have unusual ribosome compositions. All are missing a ribosomal protein often absent in symbionts, and specific lineages are missing ribosomal proteins and biogenesis factors considered universal in bacteria. This implies different ribosome structures and biogenesis mechanisms, and underlines unusual biology across a large part of the bacterial domain.


Title #244: New cofactor supports Î±,Î²-unsaturated acid decarboxylation via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.

Abstract: The bacterial ubiD and ubiX or the homologous fungal fdc1 and pad1 genes have been implicated in the non-oxidative reversible decarboxylation of aromatic substrates, and play a pivotal role in bacterial ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) biosynthesis or microbial biodegradation of aromatic compounds, respectively. Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo decarboxylase activity remained unclear. Here we show that Fdc1 is solely responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1. Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5 secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry, we propose that this presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Our model for Fdc1/UbiD catalysis offers new routes in alkene hydrocarbon production or aryl (de)carboxylation.

Abstract: Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1Î±) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 or genetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.

Abstract: During development, cells interpret complex and often conflicting signals to make optimal decisions. Plant stomata, the cellular interface between a plant and the atmosphere, develop according to positional cues, which include a family of secreted peptides called epidermal patterning factors (EPFs). How these signalling peptides orchestrate pattern formation at a molecular level remains unclear. Here we report in Arabidopsis that Stomagen (also called EPF-LIKE9) peptide, which promotes stomatal development, requires ERECTA (ER)-family receptor kinases and interferes with the inhibition of stomatal development by the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2)-ER module. Both EPF2 and Stomagen directly bind to ER and its co-receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS. Stomagen peptide competitively replaced EPF2 binding to ER. Furthermore, application of EPF2, but not Stomagen, elicited rapid phosphorylation of downstream signalling components in vivo. Our findings demonstrate how a plant receptor agonist and antagonist define inhibitory and inductive cues to fine-tune tissue patterning on the plant epidermis.

Abstract: West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded. Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a twoyear-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.


Title #248: Atomic structure of the APC/C and its mechanism of protein ubiquitination.
PMID: 26083744
Authors: Leifu L. Chang, Ziguo Z. Zhang, Jing J. Yang, Stephen H SH. McLaughlin, David D. Barford
Abstract: The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is a multimeric RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. Its regulation by coactivator subunits, phosphorylation, the mitotic checkpoint complex and interphase early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) ensures the correct order and timing of distinct cell-cycle transitions. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine atomic structures of APC/C-coactivator complexes with either Emi1 or a UbcH10-ubiquitin conjugate. These structures define the architecture of all APC/C subunits, the position of the catalytic module and explain how Emi1 mediates inhibition of the two E2s UbcH10 and Ube2S. Definition of Cdh1 interactions with the APC/C indicates how they are antagonized by Cdh1 phosphorylation. The structure of the APC/C with UbcH10-ubiquitin reveals insights into the initiating ubiquitination reaction. Our results provide a quantitative framework for the design of future experiments to investigate APC/C functions in vivo.


Title #249: UbiX is a flavin prenyltransferase required for bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis.
PMID: 26083743

Abstract: Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is a ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox cofactor that is an essential component of electron transfer chains. Eleven genes have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate precursor. Despite structural and biochemical characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no decarboxylase activity has been detected. Here we report that UbiX produces a novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD. UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases, UbiX is metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles that of the terpene synthases. The active site environment is dominated by Ï systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction, leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid biochemical repertoires.


Title #250: Gomphrena claussenii, a novel metal-hypertolerant bioindicator species, sequesters cadmium, but not zinc, in vacuolar oxalate crystals.

Abstract: Gomphrena claussenii is a recently described zinc (Zn)- and cadmium (Cd)-hypertolerant Amaranthaceae species displaying a metal bioindicator Zn/Cd accumulation response. We investigated the Zn and Cd distribution in stem and leaf tissues of G.Â claussenii at the cellular level, and determined metabolite profiles to investigate metabolite involvement in Zn and Cd sequestration. Gomphrena claussenii plants exposed to high Zn and Cd supply were analysed by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and micro-proton-induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE). In addition, gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) was used to determine metabolite profiles on high Zn and Cd exposure. Stem and leaf tissues of G.Â claussenii plants exposed to control and high Cd conditions showed the abundant presence of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals, but on high Zn exposure, their abundance was strongly reduced. Ca and Cd co-localized to the CaOx crystals in Cd-exposed plants.Â Citrate, malate and oxalate levels were all higher in shoot tissues of metal-exposed plants,Â with oxalate levels induced 2.6-fold on Zn exposure and 6.4-fold on Cd exposure. Sequestration of Cd in vacuolar CaOx crystals of G.Â claussenii is found to be a novel mechanism to deal with Cd accumulation and tolerance.


Title #251: Photoanodes with Fully Controllable Texture: The Enhanced Water Splitting Efficiency of Thin Hematite Films Exhibiting Solely (110) Crystal Orientation.
PMID: 26083741

Abstract: Hematite, Î±-Fe2O3, is considered as one of the most promising materials for sustainable hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical water splitting with a theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 17%. However, the poor electrical conductivity of hematite is a substantial limitation reducing its efficiency in real experimental conditions. Despite of computing models suggesting that the electrical conductivity is extremely anisotropic, revealing up to four orders of magnitude higher electron transport with conduction along the (110) hematite crystal plane, synthetic approaches allowing the sole growth in that direction have not been reported yet. Here, we present a strategy for controlling the crystal orientation of very thin hematite films by adjusting energy of ion flux during advanced pulsed reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The texture and effect of the deposition mode on the film properties were monitored by XRD, conversion electron MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, XPS, SEM, AFM, PEC water splitting, IPCE, transient photocurrent measurements, and Mott-Schottky analysis. The precise control of the synthetic conditions allowed to fabricate hematite photoanodes exhibiting fully textured structures along (110) and (104) crystal planes with huge differences in photocurrents of 0.65 mA cm-2 and 0.02 mA cm-2 (both at 1.55 V versus RHE), respectively. The photocurrent registered for fully textured (110) film is among record values reported for thin planar films. Moreover, the developed fine tuning of crystal orientation having a huge impact on the photoefficiency would induce further improvement of thin hematite films mainly if cation doping will be combined with the controllable texture.

Title #254: Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Activity of a Super Oxidized Solution in Clinical Isolates.
PMID: 26083738

Abstract: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of Estericide(Â®) QX (super oxidized solution) in 524 bacterial clinical isolates causing nosocomial infections. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the serial broth microdilution method. The bacterial viability of the isolates and control strains was tested. The bactericidal effect of the disinfectant was determined according to the European Standards (EN) Test Methods-1040 guidelines. Assay of stability in Estericide QX after 1 year of storage was performed. The microdilution assays showed that the isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 10-40 parts per million (ppm). For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC values 20 and 40âppm were more predominant (95%), whereas for gram-negative bacteria, the MIC values 10 and 20âppm had the highest percentage (91.7%). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). The results of the assay of bactericidal activity showed that all tested bacteria (99.999%) were killed within 30âsec of contact time. The stability test showed that Estericide QX maintained its disinfectant action over time. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the super oxidized solution of Estericide QX provides a high antibacterial activity on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Based on these results and under the conditions of the present study, we believe that Estericide QX can be used efficiently against multiresistant nosocomial bacteria, providing an opportunity for new disinfection alternatives.


Title #255: Changes in the Gene Expression Profiles of the Hypopharyngeal Gland of Worker Honeybees in Association with Worker Behavior and Hormonal Factors.
PMID: 26083737
Authors: Takayuki T. Ueno, Hideaki H. Takeuchi, Kiyoshi K. Kawasaki, Takeo T. Kubo
Abstract: The hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs) of worker honeybees undergo physiological changes along with the age-dependent role change from nursing to foraging: nurse bee HPGs secrete mainly major royal jelly proteins, whereas forager HPGs secrete mainly Î±-glucosidase III, which converts the sucrose in the nectar into glucose and fructose. We previously identified two other genes, Apis mellifera buffy (Ambuffy) and Apis mellifera matrix metalloproteinase 1 (AmMMP1), with enriched expression in nurse bee and forager HPGs, respectively. In the present study, to clarify the molecular mechanisms that coordinate HPG physiology with worker behavior, we first analyzed whether Ambuffy, AmMMP1, mrjp2 (a gene encoding one of major royal jelly protein isoforms), and Hbg3 (a gene encoding Î±-glucosidase III) expression, is associated with worker behavior in 'single-cohort colonies' where workers of almost the same age perform different tasks. Expression of these genes correlated with the worker's role, while controlling for age, indicating their regulation associated with the worker's behavior. Associated gene expression suggested the possible involvement of some hormonal factors in its regulation. We therefore examined the relationship between ecdysone- and juvenile hormone (JH)-signaling, and the expression profiles of these 'indicator' genes (nurse bee HPG-selective genes: mrjp2 and Ambuffy, and forager HPG-selective genes: Hbg3 and AmMMP1). Expression of both ecdysone-regulated genes (ecdysone receptor, mushroom body large type Kenyon cell specific protein-1, and E74) and JH-regulated genes (Methoprene tolerant and KrÃ¼ppel homolog 1) was higher in the forager HPGs than in the nurse bee HPGs, suggesting the possible roles of ecdysone- and JH-regulated genes in worker HPGs. Furthermore, 20-hydroxyecdysone-treatment repressed both nurse bee- and forager-selective gene expression, whereas methoprene-treatment enhanced the expression of forager-selective genes and repressed nurse bee-selective genes in the HPGs. Our findings suggest that both ecdysone- and JH-signaling cooperatively regulate the physiological state of the HPGs in association with the worker's behavior.

Title #257: Isolation of Novel CreERT2-Driver Lines in Zebrafish Using an Unbiased Gene Trap Approach.
PMID: 26083735
Authors: Peggy P. Jungke, Juliane J. Hammer, Stefan S. Hans, Michael M. Brand
Abstract: Gene manipulation using the Cre/loxP-recombinase system has been successfully employed in zebrafish to study gene functions and lineage relationships. Recently, gene trapping approaches have been applied to produce large collections of transgenic fish expressing conditional alleles in various tissues. However, the limited number of available cell- and tissue-specific Cre/CreERT2-driver lines still constrains widespread application in this model organism. To enlarge the pool of existing CreERT2-driver lines, we performed a genome-wide gene trap screen using a Tol2-based mCherry-T2a-CreERT2 (mCT2aC) gene trap vector. This cassette consists of a splice acceptor and a mCherry-tagged variant of CreERT2 which enables simultaneous labeling of the trapping event, as well as CreERT2 expression from the endogenous promoter. Using this strategy, we generated 27 novel functional CreERT2-driver lines expressing in a cell- and tissue-specific manner during development and adulthood. This study summarizes the analysis of the generated CreERT2-driver lines with respect to functionality, expression, integration, as well as associated phenotypes. Our results significantly enlarge the existing pool of CreERT2-driver lines in zebrafish and combined with Cre-dependent effector lines, the new CreERT2-driver lines will be important tools to manipulate the zebrafish genome.

Title #259: Skeletal Morphogenesis of Microbrachis and Hyloplesion (Tetrapoda: Lepospondyli), and Implications for the Developmental Patterns of Extinct, Early Tetrapods.
PMID: 26083733
Authors: Jennifer C JC. Olori
Abstract: The ontogeny of extant amphibians often is used as a model for that of extinct early tetrapods, despite evidence for a spectrum of developmental modes in temnospondyls and a paucity of ontogenetic data for lepospondyls. I describe the skeletal morphogenesis of the extinct lepospondyls Microbrachis pelikani and Hyloplesion longicostatum using the largest samples examined for either taxon. Nearly all known specimens were re-examined, allowing for substantial anatomical revisions that affect the scoring of characters commonly used in phylogenetic analyses of early tetrapods. The palate of H. longicostatum is re-interpreted and suggested to be more similar to that of M. pelikani, especially in the nature of the contact between the pterygoids. Both taxa possess lateral lines, and M. pelikani additionally exhibits branchial plates. However, early and rapid ossification of the postcranial skeleton, including a well-developed pubis and ossified epipodials, suggests that neither taxon metamorphosed nor were they neotenic in the sense of branchiosaurids and salamanders. Morphogenetic patterns in the foot suggest that digit 5 was developmentally delayed and the final digit to ossify in M. pelikani and H. longicostatum. Overall patterns of postcranial ossification may indicate postaxial dominance in limb and digit formation, but also more developmental variation in early tetrapods than has been appreciated. The phylogenetic position and developmental patterns of M. pelikani and H. longicostatum are congruent with the hypothesis that early tetrapods lacked metamorphosis ancestrally and that stem-amniotes exhibited derived features of development, such as rapid and complete ossification of the skeleton, potentially prior to the evolution of the amniotic egg.

Abstract: Mental health services for patients with a major depressive disorder are commonly delivered by primary care. To support the uptake of clinical practice guidelines in primary care, we developed and disseminated a practice protocol for depression tailored for a multidisciplinary audience of primary mental health care providers with the ADAPTE methodology. The research questions addressed in this study aimed at examining the experience of the development process of a mental health practice protocol in terms of adaptation, facilitation and implementation.


Title #261: The Scorpion Toxin Tf2 from Tityus fasciolatus Promotes Nav1.3 Opening.
PMID: 26083731
Authors: Thalita S TS. Camargos, Frank F. Bosmans, Solange C SC. Rego, Caroline B F CB. MourÃ£o, Elisabeth F EF. Schwartz
Abstract: We identified Tf2, the first Î²-scorpion toxin from the venom of the Brazilian scorpion Tityus fasciolatus. Tf2 is identical to Tb2-II found in Tityus bahiensis. We found that Tf2 selectively activates human (h)Nav1.3, a neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Nav) subtype implicated in epilepsy and nociception. Tf2 shifts hNav1.3 activation voltage to more negative values, thereby opening the channel at resting membrane potentials. Seven other tested mammalian Nav channels (Nav1.1-1.2; Nav1.4-1.8) expressed in Xenopus oocytes are insensitive upon application of 1 Î¼M Tf2. Therefore, the identification of Tf2 represents a unique addition to the repertoire of animal toxins that can be used to investigate Nav channel function.

Abstract: Plasma soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE) is a strong marker of vascular outcomes although evidence on the direction of association is mixed. Compared to whites, blacks have lower levels of sRAGE. We hypothesized that genetic determinants of sRAGE would help clarify the causal role of sRAGE and the black-white difference in sRAGE levels. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of sRAGE in whites and blacks from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Median plasma sRAGE levels were lower in blacks than whites (728 vs. 1067 pg/ml; P<0.0001). The T (vs. C) allele of rs2070600, a missense variant in AGER, the gene encoding RAGE, was associated with approximately 50% lower sRAGE levels in both whites (N = 1,737; P = 7.26x10-16; minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.04) and blacks (N = 581; P = 0.02; MAF = 0.01). In blacks, the T (vs. C) allele of rs2071288, intronic to AGER, was associated with 43% lower sRAGE levels (P = 2.22x10-8; MAF = 0.10) and was nearly absent in whites. These AGER SNPs explained 21.5% and 26% of the variation in sRAGE in blacks and whites, respectively, but did not explain the black-white difference in sRAGE. These SNPs were not significantly associated with incident death, coronary heart disease, diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease in whites (N = 8,130-9,017) or blacks (N = 2,293-2,871) (median follow up ~20 years). We identified strong genetic determinants of sRAGE that did not explain the large black-white difference in sRAGE levels or clearly influence risk of clinical outcomes, suggesting that sRAGE may not be a causal factor in development of these outcomes.


Title #264: An Analysis of the Matching Hypothesis in Networks.

Authors: Tao T. Jia, Robert F RF. Spivey, Boleslaw B. Szymanski, Gyorgy G. Korniss
Abstract: The matching hypothesis in social psychology claims that people are more likely to form a committed relationship with someone equally attractive. Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process indicate that patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur even when similarity is not the primary consideration in seeking partners. Yet, most if not all of these works concentrate on fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis to networks. Our results indicate that the correlation of the couple's attractiveness grows monotonically with the increased average degree and decreased degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less attractive individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with ones who are more attractive than them. The chance of failing to be matched decreases exponentially with both the attractiveness and the degree. The matching hypothesis may not hold when the degree-attractiveness correlation is present, which can give rise to negative attractiveness correlation. Finally, we find that the ratio between the number of matched couples and the size of the maximum matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the network. Our results reveal the role of network topology in the process of human mate choice and bring insights into future investigations of different matching processes in networks.


Title #265: Positively Charged Oligo[Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Fumarate] Scaffold Implantation Results in a Permissive Lesion Environment after Spinal Cord Injury in Rat.

Abstract: Positively charged oligo[poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate] (OPF+) scaffolds loaded with Schwann cells bridge spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions and support axonal regeneration in rat. The regeneration achieved is not sufficient for inducing functional recovery. Attempts to increase regeneration would benefit from understanding the effects of the scaffold and transplanted cells on lesion environment. We conducted morphometric and stereological analysis of lesions in rats implanted with OPF+ scaffolds with or without loaded Schwann cells 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks after thoracic spinal cord transection. No differences were found in collagen scarring, cyst formation, astrocyte reactivity, myelin debris, or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) accumulation. However, when scaffold-implanted animals were compared with animals with transection injuries only, these barriers to regeneration were significantly reduced, accompanied by increased activated macrophages/microglia. This distinctive and regeneration permissive tissue reaction to scaffold implantation was independent of Schwann cell transplantation. Although the tissue reaction was beneficial in the short term, we observed a chronic fibrotic host response, resulting in scaffolds surrounded by collagen at 8 weeks. This study demonstrates that an appropriate biomaterial scaffold improves the environment for regeneration. Future targeting of the host fibrotic response may allow increased axonal regeneration and functional recovery.


Title #266: Gd-Metallofullerenol Nanomaterial Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis by Inhibiting the Interaction of Histone Deacetylase 1 and Metastasis-Associated Protein 1.
PMID: 26083726

Abstract: The treatment of pancreatic cancer frequently fails due to local recurrence and hepatic metastasis. Our previous study found that Gd@C82(OH)22 can suppress pancreatic cancer by inhibiting MMP-2/9 expression. In this study, we further explored the epigenetic mechanism of Gd@C82(OH)22 in human pancreatic cancer metastasis. Gd@C82(OH)22 suppressed tumor metastasis through down-regulation of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), HDAC1, HIF-1Î±, MMP-2/9, and up-regulation of reversion-cysteine protein with Kazal motif (RECK). The level of acetylation was increased in the promoter region of RECK gene after Gd@C82(OH)22 treatment. The interaction of MTA1, HDAC1 and HIF-1Î± was inhibited by Gd@C82(OH)22. Furthermore, large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations revealed Gd@C82(OH)22 to serve as an effective HDAC inhibitor to the protein-protein association between HDAC1 and MTA1, especially through MTA1'sSANT and ELM2 dimerization domains. Our findings implicate Gd@C82(OH)22 as a novel HDAC inhibitor acting to increase RECK expression by suppressing MTA1/HDAC1 co-repressor complex. In conclusion, Gd@C82(OH)22 may serve as a potential HDAC1 inhibitor to suppress pancreatic cancer cell invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. According to computer analysis and experimental validation, Gd@C82(OH)22 activates RECK expression by inhibiting the interaction of HDAC1 and MTA1.


Title #267: Protein Corona Prevents TiO2 Phototoxicity.
PMID: 26083725
Authors: Maja M. Garvas, Anze A. Testen, Polona P. Umek, Alexandre A. Gloter, Tilen T. Koklic, Janez J. Strancar
Abstract: TiO2 nanoparticles have generally low toxicity in the in vitro systems although some toxicity is expected to originate in the TiO2-associated photo-generated radical production, which can however be modulated by the radical trapping ability of the serum proteins. To explore the role of serum proteins in the phototoxicity of the TiO2 nanoparticles we measure viability of the exposed cells depending on the nanoparticle and serum protein concentrations.


Title #268: Population attributable risk of overweight and obesity for high blood pressure in Chinese children.
PMID: 26083724
Authors: Bin B. Dong, Zhiqiang Z. Wang, Hai-Jun HJ. Wang, Jun J. Ma
Abstract: Little is known about whether eliminating overweight and obesity could effectively reduce the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) in Chinese children. This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of contribution of overweight and obesity associated with HBP in Chinese children, and assess the theoretical HBP prevalence if overweight and obesity were eliminated.


Title #269: Lack of association between arterial stiffness and genetic variants by genome-wide association scan.
PMID: 26083723
Authors: Sungha S. Park, Ji-Young JY. Lee, Byeong-Keuk BK. Kim, Sang-Hak SH. Lee, Hyuk-Jae HJ. Chang, DongHoon D. Choi, Yangsoo Y. Jang
Abstract: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. However, whether genetic risk variants are associated with arterial stiffness measures, such as pulse-wave velocity (PWV), is largely unknown. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PWV in a Korea population.


Title #270: Localization of melanopsin-immunoreactive cells in the Mongolian gerbil retina.
PMID: 26083722
Authors: Mi-Jin MJ. Jeong, Chang-Jin CJ. Jeon
Abstract: Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are involved in circadian rhythm and pupil responses. The purpose of this study was to reveal the organization of melanopsin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the Mongolian gerbil retina using immunocytochemistry. Melanopsin-IR cells were primarily located in the ganglion cell layer (GCL; M1c; 75.15%). Many melanopsin-IR cells were also observed in the inner nuclear layer (INL; M1d; 22.28%). The M1c and M1d cell types extended their dendritic processes into the OFF sublayer of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). We rarely observed bistratified cells (M3; 2.56%) with dendrites in both the ON and OFF sublayers of the IPL. Surprisingly, we did not observe M2 cells which are well observed in other rodents. Melanopsin-IR cell somas were small to medium in size and had large dendritic fields. They had 2-5 primary dendrites that branched sparingly and had varicosities. Melanopsin-IR cell density was very low: they comprised 0.49% of the total ganglion cell population. Moreover, none of the melanopsin-IR cells expressed calbindin-D28K, calretinin, or parvalbumin. These results suggest that in the Mongolian gerbil, melanopsin-IR cells are expressed in a very small RGC subpopulation, and are independent of calcium-binding proteins-containing RGCs.

Title #272: Sulfhydryl Modified Fe3O4@SiO2 Core/Shell Nanocomposite: Synthesis and Toxicity Assessment in Vitro.
PMID: 26083720
Authors: Xue-Yi XY. Guo, Fangfang F. Mao, Weijia W. Wang, Ying Y. Yang, Zhiming Z. Bai
Abstract: The objectives of this study are to prepare the sulfhydryl modified Fe3O4@SiO2 core/shell magnetic nanocomposites, assess their toxicity in vitro and explore their potential application in the biomedical fields. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the facile solvothermal method were coated with SiO2 via the StÃ¶ber method and further modified by the meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to prepare Fe3O4@SiO2@DMSA nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, functional groups, surface charge, magnetic susceptibility of the nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential analysis, dynamic laser scattering and vibrating sample magnetometer. Cytotoxicity test and hemolysis assay were investigated. Experimental results show that the toxicity of sulfhydryl modified Fe3O4@SiO2 core/shell nanoparticles in mouse fibroblast (L-929) cell lines is between grade 0 to grade 1, and the material lacks hemolysis activity, indicating good biocompatibility of this Fe3O4@SiO2@DMSA nanocomposite, which is suitable for further application in biochemical fields.

Title #274: A Note on the Relations Between Spatio-Genetic Models.
PMID: 26083718
Authors: Yael Y. Baran, Eran E. Halperin
Abstract: Modeling human genetic variation along the continuous geographic space is a new research direction that has been stirring interest in the community during the past few years. Multiple recent works suggested different probabilistic models for the relation between geography and genetic sequence, and applied them to geographic localization, detection of selection, and correction of confounding in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Prior to these developments, continuous representations of genetic structure were produced almost exclusively using dimensionality reduction techniques, mostly principal component analysis (PCA). Although fast and effective in some tasks, PCA suffers from multiple disadvantages, primarily stemming from a lack of explicit underlying genetic model. We begin this note by explaining the implicit spatio-genetic model that underlies PCA. Our presentation provides insights into some of the recently proposed spatial models; particularly, we show that two of these models can be formulated as modifications of PCA, each removing one of PCA's limitations in the context of genetic analysis. We build on one of the models to derive a nonsupervised procedure for the inference of spatial structure, and empirically demonstrate that it outperforms PCA in spatial inference. We then go on to review a few additional recent works in this unifying perspective.


Title #275: Effects of Phosphate on Arsenate Uptake and Translocation in Nonmetallicolous and Metallicolous Populations of Pteris Vittata L. Under Solution Culture.
PMID: 26083716
Authors: Fuyong F. Wu, Shengchun S. Wu, Dan D. Deng, Ming Hung MH. Wong
Abstract: An arsenic hyperaccumulator, Pteris vittata L., is common in nature and could occur either on As-contaminated soils or on uncontaminated soils. However, it is not clear whether phosphate transporter play similar roles in As uptake and translocation in nonmetallicolous and metallicolous populations of P. vittata. Five populations were used to investigate effects of phosphate on arsenate uptake and translocation in the plants growing in 1.2 L 20% modified Hoagland's nutrient solution containing either 100Â Î¼M phosphate or no phosphate and 10Â Î¼M arsenate for 1, 2, 6, 12, 24Â h, respectively. The results showed that the nonmetallicolous populations accumulated apparently more As in their fronds and roots than the metallicolous populations at both P supply levels. Phosphate significantly (P < 0.01) decreased frond and root concentrations of As during short time solution culture. In addition, the effects of phosphate on As translocation in P. vittata varied among different time-points during time-course hydroponics (1-24 h). The present results indicated that the inhibitory effect of phosphate on arsenate uptake was larger in the three nonmetallicolous populations than those in the two metallicolous populations of P. vittata.


Title #276: Optical trapping of gold nanoparticles in air.
PMID: 26083715
Authors: Liselotte L. Jauffred, S Mohammad-Reza SM. Taheri, Regina R. Schmitt, Heiner H. Linke, Lene B LB. Oddershede
Abstract: Most progress on optical nanoparticle control has been in liquids while optical control in air has proven more challenging. By utilizing an air chamber designed to have a minimum of turbulence and a single laser beam with a minimum of aberration, we trapped individual 200 to 80 nm gold nanoparticles in air and quantified the corresponding trapping strengths. These results pave the way for construction of metallic nanostructures in air away from surfaces.


Title #277: Compensatory induction of MYC expression by sustained CDK9 inhibition via a BRD4-dependent mechanism.
PMID: 26083714

Abstract: CDK9 is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb that enables RNA polymerase (Pol) II's transition from promoter-proximal pausing to productive elongation. Although considerable interest exists in CDK9 as a therapeutic target, little progress has been made due to lack of highly selective inhibitors. Here, we describe the development of i-CDK9 as such an inhibitor that potently suppresses CDK9 phosphorylation of substrates and causes genome-wide Pol II pausing. While most genes experience reduced expression, MYC and other primary response genes increase expression upon sustained i-CDK9 treatment. Essential for this increase, the bromodomain protein BRD4 captures P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to deliver to target genes and also enhances CDK9's activity and resistance to inhibition. Because the i-CDK9-induced MYC expression and binding to P-TEFb compensate for P-TEFb's loss of activity, only simultaneously inhibiting CDK9 and MYC/BRD4 can efficiently induce growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, suggesting the potential of a combinatorial treatment strategy.


Title #278: Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.
PMID: 26083713
Authors: Ran R. Li, Jin J. Zhang, Jiancai J. Li, Guoxin G. Zhou, Qi Q. Wang, Wenbo W. Bian, Matthias M. Erb, Yonggen Y. Lou
Abstract: Plants generally respond to herbivore attack by increasing resistance and decreasing growth. This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signalling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. Here, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, MAPK-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor (PI) activation and resistance against C. suppressalis. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signalling as the causal factor in N. lugens susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity.


Title #279: Synaptic representation of locomotion in single cerebellar granule cells.
PMID: 26083712
Authors: Kate K. Powell, Alexandre A. Mathy, Ian I. Duguid, Michael M. HÃ¤usser
Abstract: The cerebellum plays a crucial role in the regulation of locomotion, but how movement is represented at the synaptic level is not known. Here, we use in vivo patch-clamp recordings to show that locomotion can be directly read out from mossy fiber synaptic input and spike output in single granule cells. The increase in granule cell spiking during locomotion is enhanced by glutamate spillover currents recruited during movement. Surprisingly, the entire step sequence can be predicted from input EPSCs and output spikes of a single granule cell, suggesting that a robust gait code is present already at the cerebellar input layer and transmitted via the granule cell pathway to downstream Purkinje cells. Thus, synaptic input delivers remarkably rich information to single neurons during locomotion.


Title #280: Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Abstract: Many organisms spanning from bacteria to mammals orient to the earth's magnetic field. For a few animals, central neurons responsive to earth-strength magnetic fields have been identified; however, magnetosensory neurons have yet to be identified in any animal. We show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans orients to the earth's magnetic field during vertical burrowing migrations. Well-fed worms migrated up, while starved worms migrated down. Populations isolated from around the world, migrated at angles to the magnetic vector that would optimize vertical translation in their native soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory preferences. Magnetic orientation and vertical migrations required the TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory neuron pair. Calcium imaging showed that these neurons respond to magnetic fields even without synaptic input. C. elegans may have adapted magnetic orientation to simplify their vertical burrowing migration by reducing the orientation task from three dimensions to one.


Title #281: The neuropeptide tachykinin is essential for pheromone detection in a gustatory neural circuit.

Abstract: Gustatory pheromones play an essential role in shaping the behavior of many organisms. However, little is known about the processing of taste pheromones in higher order brain centers. Here, we describe a male-specific gustatory circuit in Drosophila that underlies the detection of the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone (3R,11Z,19Z)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually-dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8-10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression. Taken together, this work describes a neuropeptide-modulated central brain circuit that underlies the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone. These results will allow further examination of the molecular basis by which innate behaviors are modulated by gustatory cues and physiological state.


Title #282: Intussusception following rotavirus vaccination in the Valencia Region, Spain.

Abstract: Studies have shown high intussusception rates in Spain. We performed a hospital-based retrospective observational study of the intussusception risk following rotavirus vaccinations among infants in Valencia, a region of Spain with an annual birth cohort of approximately 48,000Â children, during 2007-2011, using a self-controlled case series design. We performed medical record review of all cases using Brighton CollaborationÂ´s case definition and assessed the positive predictive value (PPV) of the intussusception diagnosis code. Among 151Â hospitalized cases discharged as intussusception, we confirmed 136 as Brighton Collaboration's Levels 1 or 2, resulting in a PPV of 93% (95% CI: 87%-96%). Three confirmed cases occurred within days 1-7 following the first rotavirus vaccination. The incidence rate ratio was 9.0 (95% CI: 0.9-86.5) (crude) and 4.7 (95% CI:0.3-74.1)(age adjusted). In this first study in Europe, the intussusception risk point estimate was comparable to other studies, although results were not statistically significant, maybe due to limited power. The high PPV found will facilitate implementation of a larger study without requiring medical record review. Our finding of very few vaccinated cases despite a thorough five-year investigation in a country that, according to previous studies, may have a large background rate of intussusception is reassuring and should contribute to deliberations about the need to include rotavirus vaccines in the official Spanish calendars.


Title #283: Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): physical self-concept, pain, and life satisfaction.
PMID: 26083706
Authors: G. G. Amesberger, E. E. MÃ¼ller, S. S. WÃ¼rth
Abstract: Physical self-concept in the elderly is assumed to be structured in terms of different domains and to contribute substantially to life satisfaction. However, little is known about the role of the physical self-concept in older persons that are engaged in physical activity while suffering from typical age-related impairments or chronic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the structure of physical self-concept in a group of older persons with total knee arthroplasty (TKA), its development throughout a 12-week skiing intervention, and its importance to life satisfaction. Factor analyses of the present data reveal that the physical self-concept consists of four dimensions addressing strength, flexibility/coordination, endurance, and sportiness. One higher order factor extracted by hierarchical factor analyses reflects a global physical self-concept. The 12-week skiing intervention had no substantial impact in terms of an improvement of self-concept. Life satisfaction is best predicted by positive changes in the subjective ratings between pre- and post-test (i.e., global physical self-concept, flexibility and coordination, and perceived sportiness) and not by objective physical performance (isokinetic strength, endurance, or coordination). Results support the assumption that physical self-concept of older people with TKA is only marginally sensitive to a 12-week skiing intervention.

Abstract: This study focused on the psychological and quality of life aspects of resuming alpine skiing practice after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in elderly skilled skiers. Two data pools were used in order to analyze psychological states: (a) at the beginning, at the end, and 8 weeks after a 12-week skiing intervention; and (b) concerning diurnal variations of states (i.e., skiing days compared with everyday life during intervention and retention phase). In particular, effects of skiing on amount of physical activity and perceived exertion, perceived pain and knee function, and subjective well-being were analyzed using a control group design. Results reveal that the skiing intervention substantially increases the amount of physical activity by the intervention group (122.30âÂ±â32.38âmin/day), compared with the control group (75.14âÂ±â21.27âmin/day) [F (2, 32)â=â8.22, Pâ<â0.01, Î·(2) â=â0.34)]. Additionally, the analyses of psychological states demonstrated that skiing goes along with enhanced well-being and no significant impact on perceived pain, exertion or knee function. In sum, alpine skiing can be recommended for older persons with TKA with respect to well-being, perceived pain and knee function, and perceived exertion.


Title #285: Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): effect on tendon properties.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alpine skiing on patellar tendon properties in patients with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Thirty-one adults (70.4âÂ±â4.7 years) with unilateral TKA were recruited 2.7âÂ±â0.9 years after surgery and assigned to an intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The IG underwent a 12-week guided skiing program. Tendon stiffness, Young's modulus, and cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured before and after the intervention. In both groups, mean tendon CSA was 28% (Pâ<â0.001) larger in the operated (OP) than in the non-operated (NOP) leg at baseline, without any difference in other tendon properties. After training, stiffness increased in the IG by 5.8% and 15.8%, respectively, in the OP and NOP legs. Likewise, mean CSA increased in the IG by 2.9% in the OP and 3.8% in the NOP leg, whereas no significant changes were found for the Young's modulus. None of the tendon parameters changed in the CG. Results indicate that patellar tendon structure and/or loading pattern are altered following TKA, but this tissue seems to retain its adaptation capacity. Further, alpine skiing appears to offer a suitable rehabilitation strategy for TKA patients.


Title #286: Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): symmetric loading during skiing.

Abstract: The aim of this pilot study was to determine the pressure distribution, symmetry of load between operated (OP) and non-operated (NOP) leg, and pain level during alpine skiing in participants with unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The responses of the dependent variables were analyzed following a 10-week guided skiing intervention of 2-3 days of skiing per week. Ground reaction force (GRF) was recorded bilaterally and was determined for 13 participants with TKA (65âÂ±â4 years) at pre- and post-test. Additionally, pain perception was determined using a numeric rating scale in the OP leg at both test sessions and after each skiing day. No statistical differences were observed between OP and NOP legs for peak and average GRF as well as the asymmetry indices at pre-test. Pain perception was low and was not increased as a consequence of the skiing intervention. In conclusion, alpine skiing did not lead to increased or decreased loading of the OP leg compared with the NOP leg. Therefore, alpine skiing may be allowed for patients with skiing experience and a good clinical outcome.


Title #287: Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): effects on gait asymmetries.
PMID: 26083702

Abstract: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a 12-week recreational skiing intervention on functional gait performance in people with unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Twenty-three older adults (71âÂ±â5 years) were assigned to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). Test time and ground reaction forces (GRF) were recorded at pre- and post-intervention and in the retention phase during functional gait tests. Ground contact was recorded bilaterally and divided into the weight acceptance and push-off phases. In IG, a faster stair descent time (16%) was observed at post-test with no further change at the retention test. The asymmetry indices for all analyzed variables were decreased in stair descent and during weight acceptance in stair ascent and level walking without further changes between post- and retention test. The reduced asymmetries occurred mainly because of increased loading of the operated leg. Most variables were unchanged in CG. Similar to the force data, the asymmetry index for temporal stride characteristics was reduced in all stair descent variables. These results demonstrate that alpine skiing as a leisure-time activity has a beneficial effect on gait performance and leads to a more balanced load distribution between the legs during daily activities.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of alpine skiing for 12 weeks on skeletal muscle characteristics and biomarkers of glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty-three patients with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were studied 2.9âÂ±â0.9 years (meanâÂ±âSD) after the operation. Fourteen patients participated in the intervention group (IG) and nine in the control group (CG). Blood samples and muscle biopsies were obtained before (PRE) and 7.3âÂ±â0.8 days after (POST) the intervention, and blood samples again after a retention (RET) phase of 8 weeks. With skiing, glucose homeostasis improved in IG (decrease in fasting insulin, increase in muscle glycogen) but not in CG. Fiber type distribution and size, as well as capillary density and number of capillaries around the fibers (CAF), were not different between the operated and the non-operated leg in either group. The relative number of type I fibers increased with skiing in IG with no change in CG. Inflammatory biomarkers, plasma lipids, and mitochondrial proteins and activity did not change. Alpine skiing is metabolically beneficial and can be used as a training modality by elderly people with TKA.

Abstract: This study investigated features of skeletal muscle ageing in elderly individuals having previously undergone unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and whether markers of sarcopenia could be mitigated by a 12-week alpine skiing intervention. Novel biomarkers agrin, indicative of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) degeneration, tumor suppressor protein p53, associated with muscle atrophy, and a new ultrasound-based muscle architecture biomarker were used to characterize sarcopenia. Participant details and study design are presented by KÃ¶sters etâal. (2015). The results of this study show that NMJ degeneration is widespread among active septuagenarians previously subjected to TKA: all participants showed elevated agrin levels upon recruitment. At least 50% of individuals were identified as sarcopenic based on their muscle architecture, supporting the hypothesis that NMJ alterations precede sarcopenia. Notably, sarcopenia was strongly associated with the expression of p53, which seems to confirm its validity as a biomarker of muscle atrophy. Training did not significantly modify any of these biomarkers. In view of the lack of accretion of muscle mass in response to the alpine skiing intervention, we hypothesize that local muscle inflammation and oxidative stress may have blunted the anabolic response to training and promoted muscle breakdown in this elderly post-TKA population.

Abstract: This study investigated the effectiveness of recreational skiing as an intervention to improve quadriceps muscle architecture, strength, and antagonistic co-activation in patients with unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hence, patients with TKA were assigned to either an intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). The IG completed a 12-week guided skiing program whereas the CG was instructed not to change their daily routines for the same period and was not allowed to ski. Before, after the intervention/after an 8-week retention period m. rectus femoris (RF) cross-sectional area (CSA), m. vastus lateralis muscle thickness, fascicle length, and pennation angle were measured with ultrasonography, while isometric (90Â° knee angle) knee extension, flexion torque and m. biceps femoris co-activation were assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer in 26 patients. There were significant and stable increases in RF CSA for the operated (10%; Pâ<â0.05) and non-operated leg (12%; Pâ<â0.01) after the training period in the IG whereas no changes were observed for the CG (all Pâ>â0.05). There were no significant effects for other parameters (all Pâ>â0.05). Overall, the skiing intervention was successful in increasing muscle mass in TKA older patients.


Title #291: Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): effects on strength and cardiorespiratory fitness.

Abstract: This study investigated the effect of a 12-week recreational skiing intervention on lower limb muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in participants with unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Twenty-seven older adults (70âÂ±â5 years) were assigned to the intervention (nâ=â13) or control group (nâ=â14) after surgery (2.5âÂ±â1 years). Leg muscle strength was measured using an IsoMed 2000 dynamometer and cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by cycle ergometry before and after the intervention as well as after an 8-week retention period. The skiing intervention led to increased muscle strength in the operated leg during unilateral single joint isometric extension (maximal force: 11%; Pâ<â0.05; rate of torque development: 24%; Pâ<â0.05) and during the unilateral multi-joint isokinetic single leg strength test (8%; Pâ<â0.05). This resulted in a decreased asymmetry index in the isokinetic test (13% to 5%; Pâ<â0.05). These adaptations remained unchanged toward the retention test. No effect was observed for cardiorespiratory fitness. The results demonstrate that muscle contraction forces required during recreational skiing in individuals with TKA seem adequate and effective to increase quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength in the initially weaker operated leg and to reduce an augmented post-operative asymmetry index.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a recreational alpine skiing intervention on implant-related factors, such as loosening and wear, in patients with total knee arthoplasty (TKA). A group of 16 TKA patients were examined 2.3âÂ±â0.1 years after skiing about 80 days over three seasons inclusive of a ski intervention of 2-3 times per week (25.5 days) over a 12-week period. Mean follow-up period was 5.1âÂ±â1 years after surgery. All patients had excellent clinical and radiological outcomes. The average flexion was 120-130Â°, the average Oxford Knee Score increased from 15 points pre-operatively to 47.4 points post-operatively. An average Tegner activity level of 5.5 was assessed, indicating a very high post-operative activity level. No radiolucencies or osteolyses were observed in any of the radiographs. One patient sustained a meniscal tear in the contralateral knee. Recreational alpine skiing on intermediate terrain at moderate speed can be recommended after TKA. Analysis of mid-term follow-up has not shown any negative effect on the implant loosening or additional polyethylene wear.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to monitor the long-term effects of skiing on health-related parameters and implant related factors like loosening and wear in patients with total knee arthroplasty. This paper describes the overall study design, general demographics, and physiological demand of the intervention phase. A control group design consisting of an intervention group (nâ=â14; age: 70.4âÂ±â4.5 years) and a control group (nâ=â17; age: 71.5âÂ±â5.1 years) was utilized in this study. Parameters of interest were measured during pre-, post-, and retention test sessions. During the 12 weeks of intervention, an average of 25.5 days of guided skiing was conducted by each patient. Daily heart rate (HR) profiles and global positioning system data throughout the ski day were recorded. The intervention group completed an average of 3393 vertical meters of downhill skiing, with a total skiing distance of 33.6âkm/day. Average skiing speed was 8.2âm/s. In the skiing phase, the average physiological load was 75.9âÂ±â6.6% of HRmax . Further effects of the 12-week skiing intervention on the tested parameters will be reported in the following papers of this supplementum.


Title #294: The synergistic role of carbon quantum dots for the improved photocatalytic performance of Bi2MoO6.
PMID: 26083694

Abstract: Novel carbon quantum dot (CQD) modified Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts were prepared via a facile hydrothermal process. The CQD modified Bi2MoO6 materials were characterized by multiple techniques. The CQDs with the average size of about 7 nm were distributed on the surface of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared CQD modified Bi2MoO6 materials was investigated sufficiently by the photodegradation of four different kinds of pollutants, such as ciprofloxacin (CIP), bisphenol A (BPA), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), and methylene blue (MB). The improved photocatalytic activity was observed for CQD modified Bi2MoO6 samples compared with pure Bi2MoO6 under visible light irradiation. The CQD modified Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts with a CQD content of 2 wt% exhibited the optimum photocatalytic activity, which was found to increase by about 5 times than that of the pure Bi2MoO6 for the photodegradation of CIP. This improvement was attributed to the crucial role of CQDs, which acted as a photocenter for absorbing solar light, a charge separation center for suppressing charge recombination, and a catalytic center for pollutant photo-degradation. The main active species were determined to be ËOH and O by the ESR technique and analyzed by calculations as well as XPS valence spectra, and a possible photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed.


Title #295: Factors associated with parasite aggregation levels in fishes from Brazil.
PMID: 26083693
Authors: Cristina Fernandes do CF. Amarante, Wagner de Souza WS. Tassinari, JosÃ© Luis JL. Luque, Maria Julia Salim MJ. Pereira
Abstract: The degree of parasite aggregation is determined by a number of factors that are not well understood. In total, 3,746 fish from 73 species and their parasites were analyzed to determine associations between the degree of aggregation by taxon and specific characteristics of the fish. A multiple linear regression (95% confidence interval - CI) was used to show that in most taxa, the degree of parasite aggregation was significantly higher in freshwater fish and schooling fish but varied according to taxon in relation to gender, habitat and feeding habits. Parasite aggregations were also significantly increased in fish with a large number of parasitic larvae and greater body length in all evaluated taxa. Because the coefficients of determination of the models were lower than 60% for all taxa, other factors may be involved in parasite aggregation. Conversely, marked significance was observed for the tested variables in relation to taxon dependence, which indicates that additional studies should be performed for these factors using comprehensive databases with larger samples per parasite species.

Abstract: Neosporosis is a disease caused by the protozoon Neospora caninum that leads to significant economic losses in many countries. In the present study, we report on use of the recombinant protein NcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris in an indirect immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) for diagnosing neosporosis infection in sheep and dogs. We observed that the ELISA test yielded specificity of 94.5% and sensitivity of 100% for sheep and specificity of 93.3% and sensitivity of 100% for dogs. We observed that the sensitivity was higher than shown by the indirect fluorescent antibody test, and this was confirmed by means of Western blot. The results from this study suggest that the recombinant protein expressed in P. pastoris is a suitable antigen for use in immunodiagnosis to detect N. caninum in two important species exposed to this parasitosis.

Abstract: Ehrlichiosis is a zoonotic disease that is caused by bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia. The aims of this study were to detect the presence of Ehrlichia spp. in the blood of dogs in ItuberÃ¡, Bahia, and to compare the sensitivities and specificities of blood smear, serological, and molecular examinations. Furthermore, this study identified factors associated with exposure to the agent in dogs in this locality. Blood samples were collected from 379 dogs and submitted for indirect immunofluorescent assay and polymerase chain reaction testing for the detection of Ehrlichia spp. antibodies and DNA, respectively. Additionally, a peripheral blood smear was obtained from the ear tip for parasite identification. Of the 379 animals, 12.4%, 32.7%, and 25.6% were identified as positive on the blood smear, serological, and molecular tests, respectively. The dogs positive in one of the three techniques were considered exposed (46.9%). Younger dogs and rural habitat were protective factors and presence of ticks and contact with other dogs were the risk factors associated with exposure to the agent. It was concluded that dogs of ItuberÃ¡ have high positivity for Ehrlichia spp. and that the diagnostic methods used for detection are complementary.


Title #298: Structure of the parasites communities in two Erythrinidae fish from Amazon river system (Brazil).
PMID: 26083690
Authors: NatÃ¡lia Milhomem NM. AlcÃ¢ntara, Marcos M. Tavares-Dias
Abstract: This study compared the parasite communities of Hoplias malabaricus and Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus from Amazon river system. Hoplias malabaricus were infected by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Piscinoodinium pillulare, Tetrahymena sp., Urocleidoides eremitus, Braga patagonica, metacercariae of Clinostomum marginatum, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, larvae of Contracaecum sp. and larvae of Nomimoscolex matogrossensis. Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus were also infected by these same species of protozoans, nematodes, digeneans and cestodes, except for Tetrahymena sp. and B. patagonica, which were replaced by Argulus pestifer, Urocleidoides sp., Whittingtonocotyle caetei, Whittingtonocotyle jeju and Gorytocephalus spectabilis. For both hosts, I. multifiliis and P. pillulare were the predominant parasites. Most of the parasites presented an overdispersion. Parasite species richness, Brillouin diversity, evenness and Berger-Parker dominance were similar for the two hosts. The length and weight of H. malabaricus showed a positive correlation with the abundance of U. eremitus and Contracaecum sp., while the weight of H. unitaeniatus showed a positive correlation with the abundance of I. multifiliis. The diversity of ectoparasites seemed to be influenced by the behavior of these two hosts. This was shown by the similar parasite communities and was characterized by low species diversity, low evenness and low richness, and by a high prevalence of ectoparasites.

Abstract: Development of heart diseases is driven by dynamic changes in both the activity and connectivity of gene pathways. Understanding these dynamic events is critical for understanding pathogenic mechanisms and development of effective treatment. Currently, there is a lack of computational methods that enable analysis of multiple gene networks, each of which exhibits differential activity compared to the network of the baseline/healthy condition. We describe the iMDM algorithm to identify both unique and shared gene modules across multiple differential co-expression networks, termed M-DMs (multiple differential modules). We applied iMDM to a time-course RNA-Seq dataset generated using a murine heart failure model generated on two genotypes. We showed that iMDM achieves higher accuracy in inferring gene modules compared to using single or multiple co-expression networks. We found that condition-specific M-DMs exhibit differential activities, mediate different biological processes, and are enriched for genes with known cardiovascular phenotypes. By analyzing M-DMs that are present in multiple conditions, we revealed dynamic changes in pathway activity and connectivity across heart failure conditions. We further showed that module dynamics were correlated with the dynamics of disease phenotypes during the development of heart failure. Thus, pathway dynamics is a powerful measure for understanding pathogenesis. iMDM provides a principled way to dissect the dynamics of gene pathways and its relationship to the dynamics of disease phenotype. With the exponential growth of omics data, our method can aid in generating systems-level insights into disease progression.


Title #301: Rapid, Sensitive, and Accurate Evaluation of Drug Resistant Mutant (NS5A-Y93H) Strain Frequency in Genotype 1b HCV by Invader Assay.

Abstract: Daclatasvir and asunaprevir dual oral therapy is expected to achieve high sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with HCV genotype 1b infection. However, presence of the NS5A-Y93H substitution at baseline has been shown to be an independent predictor of treatment failure for this regimen. By using the Invader assay, we developed a system to rapidly and accurately detect the presence of mutant strains and evaluate the proportion of patients harboring a pre-treatment Y93H mutation. This assay system, consisting of nested PCR followed by Invader reaction with well-designed primers and probes, attained a high overall assay success rate of 98.9% among a total of 702 Japanese HCV genotype 1b patients. Even in serum samples with low HCV titers, more than half of the samples could be successfully assayed. Our assay system showed a better lower detection limit of Y93H proportion than using direct sequencing, and Y93H frequencies obtained by this method correlated well with those of deep-sequencing analysis (r = 0.85, P <0.001). The proportion of the patients with the mutant strain estimated by this assay was 23.6% (164/694). Interestingly, patients with the Y93H mutant strain showed significantly lower ALT levels (p=8.8 x 10-4), higher serum HCV RNA levels (p=4.3 x 10-7), and lower HCC risk (p=6.9 x 10-3) than those with the wild type strain. Because the method is both sensitive and rapid, the NS5A-Y93H mutant strain detection system established in this study may provide important pre-treatment information valuable not only for treatment decisions but also for prediction of disease progression in HCV genotype 1b patients.


Title #302: Initial test of a T9-like P300-based speller by an ALS patient.
PMID: 26083683
Authors: R. R. Ron-Angevin, S. S. Varona-Moya, L da LD. Silva-Sauer
Abstract: Visual P300-based brain-computer interface spellers offer a useful communication channel for locked-in patients, who are completely dependent in their daily lives. One of the research goals for these systems is to achieve greater communication rates by means of modifying some features of their interfaces, e.g., reducing the matrix size. However, such modifications may not work well with disabled end-users, such as patients of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), due to a supposed reduction of their cognitive resources. The purpose of the present study was to provide a proof of concept that ALS patients could efficiently use a P300-based speller with a 4 Ã 3 symbol matrix based on the T9 interface developed for mobile phones.

Abstract: Three new N-methyladenine-containing diterpenes, 2-oxoagelasines A (1) and F (2) and 10-hydro-9-hydroxyagelasine F (3), were isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Agelas nakamurai Hoshino together with eight known agelasine derivatives, 2-oxoagelasine B (4), agelasines A (5), B (6), D (7), E (8), F (9), and G (10), and ageline B (11). The structures of 1-3 were assigned on the basis of their spectroscopic data and their comparison with those of the literature. Compounds 3 and 5-11 inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis with inhibition zones of 10, 14, 15, 18, 14, 20, 12, and 12 mm at 20 Î¼g/disc, respectively. All compounds were inactive (IC50 > 10 Î¼M) against Huh-7 (hepatoma) and EJ-1 (bladder carcinoma) human cancer cell lines. Three 2-oxo derivatives (1, 2, and 4) exhibited markedly reduced biological activity against M. smegmatis. Moreover, compound 10 inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity with an IC50 value of 15 Î¼M.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the megakaryopoyesis and thrombopoiesis in preterm infants born to mothers with preeclampsia and the potential effects mediated by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) and thrombopoietin (TPO). A perspective case-control study was performed on 26 cord blood of preterm newborns born to mothers with preeclampsia (PE group) and 26 of preterms born to mothers without preeclampsia (control group). Circulating megakaryocyte count and megakaryocyte colony forming units (CFU-MK) were quantified by whole blood infiltration method and plasma clot culture system, respectively. Platelet activation markers, CD62P and CD63, were estimated by flow cytometry. Immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were employed to estimate plasma levels of sFlt1 and TPO of the two groups. When compared to the controls, infants born to mothers with PE had significantly lower peripheral platelet count (PE vs.

Title #307: Sumoylation regulates EXO1 stability and processing of DNA damage.

Abstract: DNA double-strand break repair by the error-free pathway of homologous recombination (HR) requires the concerted action of several factors. Among these, EXO1 and DNA2/BLM are responsible for the extensive resection of DNA ends to produce 3'-overhangs, which are essential intermediates for downstream steps of HR. Here we show that EXO1 is a SUMO target and that sumoylation affects EXO1 ubiquitylation and protein stability. We identify an UBC9-PIAS1/PIAS4-dependent mechanism controlling human EXO1 sumoylation in vivo and demonstrate conservation of this mechanism in yeast by the Ubc9-Siz1/Siz2 using an in vitro reconstituted system. Furthermore, we show physical interaction between EXO1 and the de-sumoylating enzyme SENP6 both in vitro and in vivo, promoting EXO1 stability. Finally, we identify the major sites of sumoylation in EXO1 and show that ectopic expression of a sumoylation-deficient form of EXO1 rescues the DNA damage-induced chromosomal aberrations observed upon wt-EXO1 expression. Thus, our study identifies a novel layer of regulation of EXO1, making the pathways that regulate its function an ideal target for therapeutic intervention.


Title #308: Versatility of electrospinning in the fabrication of fibrous mat and mesh nanostructures of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) and their magnetic and photocatalytic activities.
PMID: 26083677
Authors: S. S. Bharathkumar, M. M. Sakar, Rohith Vinod RV. K, S. S. Balakumar
Abstract: This study demonstrates the fabrication of electrospun bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3/BFO) fiber mat and fibrous mesh nanostructures consisting of aligned and random fibers respectively. The formation of these one dimensional (1D) nanostructures was mediated by the drum and plate collectors in the electrospinning process that yielded aligned and random nanofibers of BFO respectively. The single phase and rhombohedral crystal structure of the fabricated 1D BFO nanostructures are confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicated that the fabricated fibers are stoichiometric BFO with native oxidation states +3. The surface texture and morphology are analyzed using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. The average size of fibers in mat and mesh nanostructures is found to be 200 nm and 150 nm respectively. The band gap energy of BFO mat and mesh deduced from their UV diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) was found to be 2.44 eV and 2.39 eV, respectively, which evidenced the improved visible light receptivity of BFO mesh compared to that of the mat. Magnetization studies using a super conducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer revealed the weak ferromagnetic properties of BFO mesh and mat nanostructures that could emerge due to the dimension induced suppression of cycloidal spin structures. The photocatalytic degradation properties of the fibrous mesh are found to be enhanced compared to that of the mat. This could be attributed to the reduced band gap energy and an improved semiconductor band-bending phenomenon in the mesh that favoured the transportation of excited charge carriers to the photocatalyst-dye interfaces and the production of more number of reactive species that lead to the effective degradation of the dye molecules.


Title #309: A review of telavancin activity in in vitro biofilms and animal models of biofilm-associated infections.
PMID: 26083676
Authors: Cynthia C. Chan, Thomas C TC. Hardin, Jennifer I JI. Smart
Abstract: ABSTRACTâ Tissue- and device-associated biofilm infections are important medical problems. These infections are difficult to treat due to a high-level of tolerance to antibiotics. Telavancin has been studied in several in vitro biofilm models and has demonstrated efficacy against staphylococcal and enterococcal-associated biofilm infections, including those formed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was effective against the difficult-to-treat vancomycin- and glycopeptide-intermediate strains of S. aureus in these models. Furthermore, the efficacy of telavancin has been evaluated in several biofilm-related in vivo models, including osteomyelitis, endocarditis and device-associated infections in rabbits. Overall, telavancin exhibited similar or greater efficacy than vancomycin and other comparators in these animal models and maintained activity against vancomycin-intermediate and daptomycin nonsusceptible strains of S. aureus.

Abstract: A water-soluble benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) derivative that self-assembles into one-dimensional, helical, supramolecular polymers is functionalised at the periphery with one l-proline moiety. In water, the BTA-derivative forms micrometre long supramolecular polymers, which are stabilised by hydrophobic interactions and directional hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, we co-assemble a catalytically inactive, but structurally similar, BTA with the l-proline functionalised BTA to create co-polymers. This allows us to assess how the density of the l-proline units along the supramolecular polymer affects its activity and selectivity. Both the supramolecular polymers and co-polymers show high activity and selectivity as catalysts for the aldol reaction in water when using p-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone as the substrates for the aldol reaction. After optimisation of the reaction conditions, a consistent conversion of 92 Â± 7%, deanti of 92 Â± 3%, and eeanti of 97 Â± 1% are obtained with a concentration of l-proline as low as 1 mol%.

Abstract: Acetylation is a post-translational modification that occurs on thousands of proteins located in many cellular organelles. This process mediates many protein functions and modulates diverse biological processes. In mammalian cells, where acetyl-CoA is the primary acetyl donor, acetylation in the mitochondria is thought to occur by chemical means due to the relatively high concentration of acetyl-CoA located in this organelle. In contrast, acetylation outside of the mitochondria is thought to be mediated predominantly by acetyltransferase enzymes. Here we address the possibility that non-enzymatic chemical acetylation outside of the mitochondria may be more common than previously appreciated. We employed the Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array platform to perform an unbiased screen for human proteins that undergo chemical acetylation, which resulted in the identification of a multitude of proteins with diverse functions and cellular localization. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that basic residues typically precede the acetylated lysine in the -7 to -3 position, and we show by mutagenesis that these basic residues contribute to chemical acetylation capacity. We propose that these basic residues lower the pKa of the substrate lysine for efficient chemical acetylation. Many of the identified proteins reside outside of the mitochondria, and have been previously demonstrated to be acetylated in vivo. As such, our studies demonstrate that chemical acetylation occurs more broadly throughout the eukaryotic cell than previously appreciated, and suggests that this post-translational protein modification may have more diverse roles in protein function and pathway regulation.


Title #312: How do epidermal matrix metalloproteinases support re-epithelialization during skin healing?
PMID: 26083673
Authors: Anna A. Michopoulou, Patricia P. Rousselle
Abstract: Epithelialization of normal wounds occurs by an orderly series of events whereby keratinocytes migrate, proliferate, and differentiate to restore the epidermal barrier function. Keratinocyte migration is one of the earliest and crucial events determining the efficiency of the overall wound repair process. In response to various stimuli including that of growth factors, cytokines and the extracellular matrix, activated keratinocytes at the edges of the wound undergo dramatic morphological changes according to their migratory behaviour through development of protrusive adhesion contacts and cytoskeleton rearrangements. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by the upregulated expression of a new set of genes, among which are adhesion receptors and specific matrix degrading enzymes named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The tightly regulated spatial and temporal MMP expression is crucial for proper re-epithelialization. These multi-domain zinc-containing endopeptidases are necessary for the proper completion of multiple features of epidermal regeneration. They play a key role in the migration process by controlling the repeated cycles of keratinocyte attachment and retraction. In the meantime, they process, degrade or remodel the extracellular matrix often producing cleavages in a gain-of-function manner.


Title #313: Update on the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma development in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
PMID: 26083672
Authors: Minhee M. Kim, Dedee F DF. Murrell
Abstract: Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a recessively inherited blistering disorder due to mutations in the collagen VII gene, COL7A1. Patients with RDEB have up to a 50 fold increased incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) which is independent of ultraviolet (UV) exposure. The pathogenesis of cSCC development and its aggressive nature in RDEB remain unclear. To date there is no convincing evidence that RDEB SCC and UV SCC are distinct. A recent discovery of a remarkably distinct tumour microenvironment in part explains the aggressive nature of RDEB SCC and the importance of collagen VII expression as a potential therapeutic measure. The role of gram negative flagellate bacteria increasing the risk of SCC development in chronic wounds has recently been elucidated in RDEB.


Title #314: New easy handling and sampling device for bioavailability screening of topical formulations.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical assessment of topical drug formulations is widely carried out by using vertical diffusion cells (Franz type cell). Although Franz diffusion cell model is well designed for percutaneous absorption studies, the extent of drug penetration within the skin requires more adapted device. Recently, we have developed a new patented versatile, easy-to-use, and disposable diffusion cell called VitroPharma. In this study we have assessed the cutaneous bioavailability of caffeine as hydrophilic compound model using Franz diffusion cell and VitroPharma. The percutaneous absorption of caffeine assessed with Franz diffusion cell and VitroPharma was characterized by using (i) finite dose model and (ii) classical pharmacokinetic analysis. Furthermore, the follow-up of caffeine penetration within the skin was determined by sequential measurements of tissular drug concentration throughout the time of skin exposure with VitroPharma. However, classical experimental design using Franz diffusion cell involved unique determination of tissular concentration at the final point of skin exposure protocol. Finally, device equivalence between Franz diffusion cell and VitroPharma was claimed from percutaneous absorption data analysis. Concomitant assessment of dual penetration and permeation kinetics by using VitroPharma reinforced the understanding of skin drug delivery.


Title #315: Skin and arthropods: an effective interaction used by pathogens in vector-borne diseases.
PMID: 26083670
Authors: Quentin Q. Bernard, BenoÃ®t B. Jaulhac, Nathalie N. Boulanger
Abstract: In the last years, the skin has been described as a major interface in arthropod borne diseases. Although it constitutes an efficient immune and physical barrier, pathogens have developed effective strategies to thwart the host. In this process, the arthropod plays a major role. For mosquitoes, the quick blood meal is made through an efficient inoculation process directly into the blood vessel. For the long lasting blood meal of hard ticks, the sophisticated biting pieces and the tick saliva provide potent tools to help pathogen transmission. Lyme borreliosis and leishmaniases have been particularly well investigated in this context.


Title #316: Synthesis and DNA/RNA binding properties of conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA with a tetrahydrofuran backbone deriving from deoxyribose.
PMID: 26083668
Authors: Pitchanun P. Sriwarom, Panuwat P. Padungros, Tirayut T. Vilaivan
Abstract: Sugar-derived cyclic Î²-amino acids are important building blocks for designing of foldamers and other biomimetic structures. We report herein the first synthesis of a C-activated N-Fmoc-protected trans-(2S,3S)-2-aminotetrahydrofuran-3-carboxylic acid as a building block for Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. Starting from 2-deoxy-D-ribose, the product is obtained in 6.7% overall yield following an 11-step reaction sequence. The tetrahydrofuran amino acid is used as a building block for a new peptide nucleic acid (PNA), which exhibits excellent DNA binding affinity with high specificity. It also shows preference for binding to DNA over RNA, and specifically in antiparallel orientation. In addition, the presence of the hydrophilic tetrahydrofuran ring in the PNA structure reduces non-specific interactions and self-aggregation, which is a common problem in PNA due to its hydrophobic nature.

Abstract: A "turn-on" pattern Fe3+-selective fluorescent sensor was synthesized and characterized, showing high fluorescence discrimination of Fe3+ over Fe2+ and other tested ions. With a 62-fold fluorescence enhancement towards Fe3+, the probe was employed to detect Fe3+ in vivo in HeLa cells and C. elegans, and it was also successfully used to elucidate Fe3+ enrichment and exchange infected by Inx3 in hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells.


Title #319: The Mungo Mega-Lake Event, Semi-Arid Australia: Non-Linear Descent into the Last Ice Age, Implications for Human Behaviour.
PMID: 26083665
Authors: Kathryn E KE. Fitzsimmons, Nicola N. Stern, Colin V CV. Murray-Wallace, William W. Truscott, Cornel C. Pop
Abstract: The Willandra Lakes complex is one of the few locations in semi-arid Australia to preserve both paleoenvironmental and Paleolithic archeological archives at high resolution. The stratigraphy of transverse lunette dunes on the lakes' downwind margins record a late Quaternary sequence of wetting and drying. Within the Willandra system, the Lake Mungo lunette is best known for its preservation of the world's oldest known ritual burials, and high densities of archeological traces documenting human adaptation to changing environmental conditions over the last 45 ka. Here we identify evidence at Lake Mungo for a previously unrecognised short-lived, very high lake filling phase at 24 ka, just prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Mega-lake Mungo was up to 5 m deeper than preceding or subsequent lake full events and represented a lake volume increase of almost 250%. Lake Mungo was linked with neighboring Lake Leaghur at two overflow points, creating an island from the northern part of the Mungo lunette. This event was most likely caused by a pulse of high catchment rainfall and runoff, combined with neotectonic activity which may have warped the lake basin. It indicates a non-linear transition to more arid ice age conditions. The mega-lake restricted mobility for people living in the area, yet archeological traces indicate that humans rapidly adapted to the new conditions. People repeatedly visited the island, transporting stone tools across water and exploiting food resources stranded there. They either swam or used watercraft to facilitate access to the island and across the lake. Since there is no evidence for watercraft use in Australia between initial colonization of the continent prior to 45 ka and the mid-Holocene, repeated visits to the island may represent a resurrection of waterfaring technologies following a hiatus of at least 20 ky.


Title #320: Brain Mechanisms Supporting Violated Expectations of Pain.
PMID: 26083664
Authors: Fadel F. Zeidan, Oleg V OV. Lobanov, Robert A RA. Kraft, Robert C RC. Coghill
Abstract: The subjective experience of pain is influenced by interactions between prior experiences, future predictions and incoming afferent information. Expectations of high pain can exacerbate pain while expectations of low pain during a consistently noxious stimulus can produce significant reductions in pain. However, the brain mechanisms associated with processing mismatches between expected and experienced pain are poorly understood, but are important for imparting salience to a sensory event in order to override erroneous top-down expectancy-mediated information. The present investigation examined pain-related brain activation when expectations of pain were abruptly violated. After conditioning participants to cues predicting low or high pain, ten incorrectly cued stimuli were administered across 56 stimulus trials to determine if expectations would be less influential on pain when there is a high discordance between pre-stimulus cues and corresponding thermal stimulation. Incorrectly cued stimuli produced pain ratings and pain-related brain activation consistent with placebo analgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, and violated expectations. Violated expectations of pain were associated with activation in distinct regions of the inferior parietal lobe, including the supramarginal and angular gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobe, cerebellum and occipital lobe. Thus, violated expectations of pain engage mechanisms supporting salience-driven sensory discrimination, working memory, and associative learning processes. By overriding the influence of expectations on pain, these brain mechanisms are likely engaged in clinical situations where patients' unrealistic expectations for pain relief diminish the efficacy of pain treatments. Accordingly, these findings underscore the importance of maintaining realistic expectations to augment the effectiveness of pain management.

Abstract: The present study tested our hypothesis that university students with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience less satisfactory academic lives than those of students without IBS. We also verified the hypothesis that university students with IBS might have higher employment anxiety than students without IBS might. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,686 university students. Presence or absence of IBS was assessed via the Rome III Questionnaire. Two original items were used to evaluate academic life. The prevalence rates of IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, mixed IBS, and unsubtyped IBS in the study population were 5%, 2%, 10%, and 3%, respectively. Regarding academic life, the proportions of participants who experienced maladjustment and employment anxiety were 29% and 50%, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and faculty, the odds ratios for maladjustment and employment anxiety were significantly higher in students who screened positively, relative to those who screened negatively, for IBS (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.24-2.21; OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.68-2.81, respectively). In conclusion, maladjustment and anxiety over future employment were higher in university students with IBS relative to those without.

Title #325: Evaluation of a cone beam computed tomography geometry for image guided small animal irradiation.
PMID: 26083659

Abstract: The conventional imaging geometry for small animal cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is that a detector panel rotates around the head-to-tail axis of an imaged animal ('tubular' geometry). Another unusual but possible imaging geometry is that the detector panel rotates around the anterior-to-posterior axis of the animal ('pancake' geometry). The small animal radiation research platform developed at Johns Hopkins University employs the pancake geometry where a prone-positioned animal is rotated horizontally between an x-ray source and detector panel. This study is to assess the CBCT image quality in the pancake geometry and investigate potential methods for improvement. We compared CBCT images acquired in the pancake geometry with those acquired in the tubular geometry when the phantom/animal was placed upright simulating the conventional CBCT geometry. Results showed signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios in the pancake geometry were reduced in comparison to the tubular geometry at the same dose level. But the overall spatial resolution within the transverse plane of the imaged cylinder/animal was better in the pancake geometry. A modest exposure increase to two folds in the pancake geometry can improve image quality to a level close to the tubular geometry. Image quality can also be improved by inclining the animal, which reduces streak artifacts caused by bony structures. The major factor resulting in the inferior image quality in the pancake geometry is the elevated beam attenuation along the long axis of the phantom/animal and consequently increased scatter-to-primary ratio in that orientation. Not withstanding, the image quality in the pancake-geometry CBCT is adequate to support image guided animal positioning, while providing unique advantages of non-coplanar and multiple mice irradiation. This study also provides useful knowledge about the image quality in the two very different imaging geometries, i.e. pancake and tubular geometry, respectively.


Title #326: Effects of Alda-1, an Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-2 Agonist, on Hypoglycemic Neuronal Death.

Abstract: Hypoglycemic encephalopathy (HE) is caused by a lack of glucose availability to neuronal cells, and no neuroprotective drugs have been developed as yet. Studies on the pathogenesis of HE and the development of new neuroprotective drugs have been conducted using animal models such as the hypoglycemic coma model and non-coma hypoglycemia model. However, both models have inherent problems, and establishment of animal models that mimic clinical situations is desirable. In this study, we first developed a short-term hypoglycemic coma model in which rats could be maintained in an isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG) state for 2 min and subsequent hyperglycemia without requiring anti-seizure drugs and an artificial ventilation. This condition caused the production of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a cytotoxic aldehyde, in neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and a marked increase in neuronal death as evaluated by Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining. We also investigated whether N-(1,3-benzodioxole-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichlorobenzamide (Alda-1), a small-molecule agonist of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2, could attenuate 4-HNE levels and reduce hypoglycemic neuronal death. After confirming that EEG recordings remained isoelectric for 2 min, Alda-1 (8.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) was administered intravenously with glucose to maintain a blood glucose level of 250 to 270 mg/dL. Fewer 4-HNE and FJB-positive cells were observed in the cerebral cortex of Alda-1-treated rats than in DMSO-treated rats 24 h after glucose administration (P = 0.002 and P = 0.020). Thus, activation of the ALDH2 pathway could be a molecular target for HE treatment, and Alda-1 is a potentially neuroprotective agent that exerts a beneficial effect on neurons when intravenously administered simultaneously with glucose.


Title #327: Genome-wide association study of acute kidney injury after coronary bypass graft surgery identifies susceptibility loci.

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious complication of cardiac surgery. Since prior studies have supported a genetic basis for postoperative AKI, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AKI following coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The discovery data set consisted of 873 nonemergent CABG surgery patients with cardiopulmonary bypass (PEGASUS), while a replication data set had 380 cardiac surgical patients (CATHGEN). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were based on Illumina Human610-Quad (PEGASUS) and OMNI1-Quad (CATHGEN) BeadChips. We used linear regression with adjustment for a clinical AKI risk score to test SNP associations with the postoperative peak rise relative to preoperative serum creatinine concentration as a quantitative AKI trait. Nine SNPs meeting significance in the discovery set were detected. The rs13317787 in GRM7|LMCD1-AS1 intergenic region (3p21.6) and rs10262995 in BBS9 (7p14.3) were replicated with significance in the CATHGEN data set and exhibited significantly strong overall association following meta-analysis. Additional fine mapping using imputed SNPs across these two regions and meta-analysis found genome-wide significance at the GRM7|LMCD1-AS1 locus and a significantly strong association at BBS9. Thus, through an unbiased GWAS approach, we found two new loci associated with post-CABG AKI providing new insights into the pathogenesis of perioperative AKI.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ki.2015.161.


Title #328: A randomized trial of intravenous and oral iron in chronic kidney disease.
PMID: 26083656
Authors: Rajiv R. Agarwal, John W JW. Kusek, Maria K MK. Pappas
Abstract: Although iron is commonly used to correct iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), its effect on kidney function is unclear. To assess this, we randomly assigned patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and IDA to either open-label oral ferrous sulfate (69 patients to 325âmg three times daily for 8 weeks) or intravenous iron sucrose (67 patients to 200âmg every 2 weeks, total 1âg). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in slope of measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) change over two years. The trial was terminated early on the recommendation of an independent data and safety monitoring board based on little chance of finding differences in mGFR slopes, but a higher risk of serious adverse events in the intravenous iron treatment group. mGFR declined similarly over two years in both treatment groups (oral -3.6âml/min per 1.73âm(2), intravenous -4.0âml/min per 1.73âm(2), between-group difference -0.35âml/min per 1.73âm(2); 95% confidence interval -2.9 to 2.3). There were 36 serious cardiovascular events among 19 participants assigned to the oral iron treatment group and 55 events among 17 participants of the intravenous iron group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2.51 (1.56-4.04)). Infections resulting in hospitalizations had a significant adjusted incidence rate ratio of 2.12 (1.24-3.64). Thus, among non-dialyzed patients with CKD and IDA, intravenous iron therapy is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including those from cardiovascular causes and infectious diseases.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ki.2015.163.

Abstract: The study of kidney cancer pathogenesis and its treatment has been limited by the scarcity of genetically defined animal models. The FLCN gene that codes for the protein folliculin, mutated in Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome, presents a new target for mouse modeling of kidney cancer. Here we developed a kidney-specific knockout model by disrupting the mouse Flcn in the proximal tubules, thus avoiding homozygous embryonic lethality or neonatal mortality, and eliminating the requirement of loss of heterozygosity for tumorigenesis. This knockout develops renal cysts and early onset (6 months) of multiple histological subtypes of renal neoplasms featuring high tumor penetrance. Although the majority of the tumors were chromophobe renal cell carcinomas in affected mice under 1 year of age, papillary renal cell carcinomas predominated in the kidneys of older knockout mice. This renal neoplasia from cystic hyperplasia at 4 months to high-grade renal tumors by 16 months represented the progression of tumorigenesis. The mTOR and TGF-Î² signalings were upregulated in Flcn-deficient tumors, and these two activated pathways may synergetically cause renal tumorigenesis. Treatment of knockout mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for 10 months led to the suppression of tumor growth. Thus, our model recapitulates human Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© kidney tumorigenesis, provides a valuable tool for further study of Flcn-deficient renal tumorigenesis, and tests new drugs/approaches to their treatment.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ki.2015.177.


Title #330: Sirtuin and metabolic kidney disease.
PMID: 26083654
Authors: Shu S. Wakino, Kazuhiro K. Hasegawa, Hiroshi H. Itoh
Abstract: Sirtuin is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase. One of its isoforms, Sirt1, is a key molecule in glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism. The renal protective effects of Sirt1 are found in various models of renal disorders with metabolic impairment, such as diabetic nephropathy. Protective effects include the maintenance of glomerular barrier function, anti-fibrosis effects, anti-oxidative stress effects, and regulation of mitochondria function and energy metabolism. Various target molecules subject to direct deacetylation or epigenetic gene regulation have been identified as effectors of the renal protective function of sirtuin. Recently, it was demonstrated that Sirt1 expression decreases in proximal tubules before albuminuria in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy, and that albuminuria is suppressed in proximal tubule-specific mice overexpressing Sirt1. These findings suggest that decreased Sirt1 expression in proximal tubular cells causes abnormal nicotine metabolism and reduces the supply of nicotinamide mononucleotide from renal tubules to glomeruli. This further decreases expression of Sirt1 in glomerular podocytes and increases expression of a tight junction protein, claudin-1, which results in albuminuria. Activators of the sirtuin family of proteins, including resveratrol, may be important in the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ki.2015.157.


Title #331: Sclerostin and DKK1: new players in renal bone and vascular disease.
PMID: 26083653
Authors: Pieter P. Evenepoel, Patrick P. D'Haese, Vincent V. Brandenburg
Abstract: For more than a decade, the Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway has been the focus of intense basic and clinical research in the bone field because of its importance in skeletal development and maintenance of bone mass. Wnt activation increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption. The Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling pathway is tightly regulated by several inhibitors, among which Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin have been most comprehensively studied. Mounting evidence indicates that a disturbed Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling is also implicated in the pathogenesis of the chronic kidney disease-associated bone and mineral disorder (CKD-MBD) and affects its various components. DKK1 and sclerostin, more specifically, may be involved in the intense cross-talk between the kidneys, vasculature, and bone. Studies exploring clinical correlates of circulating sclerostin and DKK1 levels so far yielded conflicting results. Biological variability and analytical issues account at least partly for this inconsistency. Antibodies neutralizing Wnt inhibitors may be an appealing strategy to prevent or treat CKD-MBD. Caution is however warranted as sclerostin not only opposes mineralization in the bone but possibly also in the vasculature. Additional studies are required to define determinants of Wnt inhibitors in CKD and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recently introduced pharmaceuticals targeting these inhibitors.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ki.2015.156.


Title #332: Mechanisms of Cachexia in Chronic Disease States.
PMID: 26083652
Authors: Tadashi T. Yoshida, Patrice P. Delafontaine
Abstract: Sarcopenia and cachexia are muscle wasting syndromes associated with aging and with many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). While mechanisms are complex, these conditions are often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased Ang II levels and cachexia, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment improves weight loss. It was found that Ang II infusion in rodents leads to skeletal muscle wasting. Ang II increases cytokines and circulating hormones, such as tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, serum amyloid-A and glucocorticoids, which regulate muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ang II-induced muscle wasting is caused by alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, enhanced muscle protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and decreased appetite resulting from the downregulation of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides, such as Npy and orexin. Ang II also inhibits 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity and disrupts normal energy balance via the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphatase PP2CÎ±. Furthermore, Ang II inhibits skeletal muscle stem (satellite) cell proliferation, leading to lowered muscle regenerative capacity. Distinct satellite cell angiotensin receptor subtypes have different effects on different stages of differentiation and are critical for the regulation of muscle regeneration. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in mechanisms underlying cachexia in chronic disease states, and it is a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in patients with diseases such as CHF and CKD.

Title #334: Traumatic Brain Injury and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.
PMID: 26083647
Authors: John B JB. Hiebert, Qiuhua Q. Shen, Amanda R AR. Thimmesch, Janet D JD. Pierce
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States and causes mitochondrial damage leading to impaired brain function. The purpose of this review is to (1) describe TBI processes and manifestations, (2) examine the mitochondrial alterations after TBI, specifically increased reactive oxygen species production, decreased bioenergetics and apoptosis and (3) current TBI treatments. There are various degrees of severity of TBI, yet all affect mitochondrial function. Currently, health care professionals use various methods to assess TBI severity-from brain imaging to serum biomarkers. The major cause of TBI-associated brain damage is secondary injury, which is mainly from mitochondrial injury dysfunction. Mitochondrial injury leads to oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis and decreased cellular energy production. These brain cellular alterations impair neurologic functions, which are observed in individuals with TBI. The complex mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI requires treatment that specifically addresses the secondary injury. There are numerous therapies being used, including (1) hypothermia, (2) hyperbaric oxygen, (3) exercise and (4) antioxidants. Researchers are exploring novel approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat TBI focusing on maintaining mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Incorporating spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and first-principles calculations, we resolve spin-polarized states and consequent features in a pentacene-Co hybrid system. The pentacene adsorption site and the Co stacking are identified via investigations into the structural distortion of pentacene. Near the Fermi energy, spin-dependent recovery of the molecule symmetry and an inversion of spin-polarization in pentacene with respect to Co are observed. The experimental findings and calculation results are interpreted by a $p_{z}$-$d$ hybridization model, in which spin-dependent splitting of molecular orbitals happens at metal-organic spinterfaces.

Abstract: Arylpiperazine-based dopaminergic/serotonergic ligands exert neuroprotective activity. We examined the effect of arylpiperazine D2 /5-HT1A ligands, N-{4-[2-(4-phenyl-piperazin-1-yl)-ethyl}-phenyl]-picolinamide (6a) and N-{3-[2-(4-phenyl-piperazin-1-yl)-ethyl]-phenyl}-picolinamide (6b), in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of neuroinflammation. Both compounds (10 mg/kg i.p.) reduced EAE clinical signs in spinal cord homogenate-immunized Dark Agouti rats. Compound 6b was more efficient in delaying the disease onset and reducing the maximal clinical score, which correlated with its higher affinity for D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. The protection was retained if treatment was limited to the effector (from day 8 onwards), but not the induction phase (day 0-7) of EAE. Compound 6b reduced CNS immune infiltration and expression of mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, IL-1, and GM-CSF, TH 1 cytokine IFN-Î³, TH 17 cytokine IL-17, as well as the signature transcription factors of TH 1 (T-bet) and TH 17 (RORÎ³t) cells. Arylpiperazine treatment reduced apoptosis and increased the activation of anti-apoptotic mediators Akt and p70S6 kinase in the CNS of EAE animals. The in vitro treatment with 6b protected oligodendrocyte cell line OLN-93 and neuronal cell line PC12 from mitogen-activated normal T cells or myelin basic protein-activated encephalitogenic T cells. In conclusion, arylpiperazine dopaminergic/serotonergic ligands suppress EAE through a direct neuroprotective action and decrease in CNS inflammation. This article is protected by copyright.

Title #337: Expanding the Caring Lens: Nursing and Medical Students Reflecting on Images of Older People.
PMID: 26083643
Authors: Gabrielle G. Brand, Karen K. Miller, Rosemary R. Saunders, Helen H. Dugmore, Christopher C. Etherton-Beer
Abstract: In changing higher education environments, health profession's educators have been increasingly challenged to prepare future health professionals to care for ageing populations. This paper will report on an exploratory, mixed method research study that used an innovative photo-elicitation technique and interprofessional small group work in the classroom to enhance the reflective learning experience of medical and nursing students. Data were collected from both pre and post questionnaires and focus groups to explore shifts in perceptions towards older persons following the reflective learning session. The qualitative data revealed how using visual images of older persons provides a valuable learning space for reflection. Students found meaning in their own learning by creating shared storylines that challenged their perceptions of both older people and themselves as future health professionals. These data supports the use of visual methodologies to enhance engagement, reflection and challenge students to explore and deepen their understanding in gerontology.


Title #338: Nox4 Is Dispensable for Exercise Induced Muscle Fibre Switch.
PMID: 26083642
Authors: Juri J. Vogel, FlÃ¡via F. Figueiredo de Rezende, Susanne S. Rohrbach, Min M. Zhang, Katrin K. SchrÃ¶der
Abstract: By producing H2O2, the NADPH oxidase Nox4 is involved in differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Exercise alters the composition of slow and fast twitch fibres in skeletal. Here we hypothesized that Nox4 contributes to exercise-induced adaptation such as changes in muscle metabolism or muscle fibre specification and studied this in wildtype and Nox4-/- mice.

Title #340: When Medical News Comes from Press Releases-A Case Study of Pancreatic Cancer and Processed Meat.
PMID: 26083640

Abstract: The media have a key role in communicating advances in medicine to the general public, yet the accuracy of medical journalism is an under-researched area. This project adapted an established monitoring instrument to analyse all identified news reports (n = 312) on a single medical research paper: a meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Cancer which showed a modest link between processed meat consumption and pancreatic cancer. Our most significant finding was that three sources (the journal press release, a story on the BBC News website and a story appearing on the 'NHS Choices' website) appeared to account for the content of over 85% of the news stories which covered the meta analysis, with many of them being verbatim or moderately edited copies and most not citing their source. The quality of these 3 primary sources varied from excellent (NHS Choices, 10 of 11 criteria addressed) to weak (journal press release, 5 of 11 criteria addressed), and this variance was reflected in the accuracy of stories derived from them. Some of the methods used in the original meta-analysis, and a proposed mechanistic explanation for the findings, were challenged in a subsequent commentary also published in the British Journal of Cancer, but this discourse was poorly reflected in the media coverage of the story.


Title #341: Phenyl esters are potent inhibitors of caseinolytic protease P and reveal a stereogenic switch for de-oligomerization.
PMID: 26083639
Authors: Mathias W MW. Hackl, Markus M. Lakemeyer, Maria M. Dahmen, Manuel M. Glaser, Axel A. Pahl, Katrin K. Lorenz-Baath, Thomas T. Menzel, Sonja S. Sievers, Thomas T. Boettcher, Iris I. Antes, Herbert H. Waldmann, Stephan Axel SA. Sieber
Abstract: Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) represents a central bacterial degradation machinery that is involved in cell homeostasis and pathogenicity. The functional role of ClpP has been studied by genetic knockouts and through the use of beta-lactones, which remain the only specific inhibitors of ClpP discovered to date. Beta-lactones have served as chemical tools to manipulate ClpP in several organisms, however, their potency, selectivity and stability is limited. Despite detailed structural insights into the composition and conformational flexibility of the ClpP active site, no rational efforts to design specific non-beta-lactone inhibitors have been reported to date. In this work, an unbiased screen of more than 137,000 compounds was used to identify five phenyl ester compounds as highly potent ClpP inhibitors that were selective for bacterial, but not human ClpP. The potency of phenyl esters largely exceeded that of beta-lactones in ClpP peptidase and protease inhibition assays and displayed unique target selectivity in living S. aureus cells. Analytical studies revealed that while phenyl esters are cleaved like native peptide substrates, they remain covalently trapped as acyl-enzyme intermediates in the active site. The synthesis of 36 derivatives and subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies provided insights into conserved structural elements that are important for inhibition potency and acylation reactivity. Moreover, the stereochemistry of a methyl-substituent at the alpha position to the ester, resembling amino acid side chains in peptide substrates, impacted ClpP complex stability, causing either dissociation into heptamers or retention of the tetradecameric state. Mechanistic insights into this intriguing stereo switch and the phenyl ester binding mode were obtained by molecular docking experiments.


Title #342: Patient loyalty model.
PMID: 26083638
Authors: Sik S. Sumaedi, I Gede Mahatma Yuda IG. Bakti, Tri T. Rakhmawati, Nidya Judhi NJ. Astrini, Medi M. Yarmen, Tri T. Widianti
Abstract: Purpose - This study aims to investigate the simultaneous effect of subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and trust on patient loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data were collected through survey. The respondents of the survey are 157 patients of a health-care service institution in Bogor, Indonesia. Multiple regressions analysis was performed to test the conceptual model and the proposed hypotheses. Findings - The findings showed that subjective norm and trust influence patient loyalty positively. However, this research also found that perceived behavioral control does not influence patient loyalty significantly. Research limitations/implications - The survey was only conducted at one health-care service institution in Bogor, Indonesia. In addition, convenience sampling method was used. These conditions may cause that the research results can not be generalized to the other contexts. Therefore, replication research is needed to test the stability of the findings in the other contexts. Practical implications - Health-care service institutions need to pay attention to trust and subjective norm to establish patient loyalty. Originality/value - This study is believed to be the first to develop and test patient loyalty model that includes subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and trust.


Title #343: Sense of community and job satisfaction among social and health care managers.
PMID: 26083637
Authors: Mai-Stiina MS. Lampinen, Elina Annikki EA. Viitanen, Anne Irmeli AI. Konu
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how the factors associated with sense of community at work are connected with job satisfaction among the front-line managers and middle managers in social and health-care services in Finland. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire prepared for this study was sent to 241 social and health-care managers (front line and middle managers) in Finland. A total of 136 of managers responded to the survey (response rate was 56 per cent). Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. Findings - Alongside job meaningfulness, open communication and good flow of information within the organization, sense of security provided by close relationships at work and managers' own superiors' appreciation of their leadership skills all are related to managers' job satisfaction. Originality/value - The study adds to our understanding of factors which are connected to the job satisfaction among social and health-care managers'. The findings of this study can be used in the development of leadership to support managers in coping at work.


Title #344: Changes in commitment to change among leaders in home help services.
PMID: 26083636
Authors: Kristina K. Westerberg, Susanne S. Tafvelin
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of the this study was to explore the development of commitment to change among leaders in the home help services during organizational change and to study this development in relation to workload and stress. During organizational change initiatives, commitment to change among leaders is important to ensure the implementation of the change. However, little is known of development of commitment of change over time. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a qualitative design with semi-structured interviews with ten leaders by the time an organizational change initiative was launched and follow-up one year later. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the interviews. Findings - Commitment to change is not static, but seems to develop over time and during organizational change. At the first interview, leaders had a varied pattern reflecting different dimensions of commitment to change. One year later, the differences between leaders' commitment to change was less obvious. Differences in commitment to change had no apparent relationship with workload or stress. Research limitations/implications - The data were collected from one organization, and the number of participants were small which could affect the results on workload and stress in relation to commitment to change. Practical implications - It is important to support leaders during organizational change initiatives to maintain their commitment. One way to accomplish this is to use management team meetings to monitor how leaders perceive their situation. Originality/value - Qualitative, longitudinal and leader studies on commitment to change are all unusual, and taken together, this study shows new aspects of commitment.


Title #345: Manager traits and quality-of-care performance in hospitals.
PMID: 26083635
Authors: Kjeld Harald KH. Aij, RenÃ© L M C RL. Aernoudts, Gepke G. Joosten
Abstract: Purpose - This paper aims to assess the impact of the leadership traits of chief executive officers (CEOs) on hospital performance in the USA. The effectiveness and efficiency of the CEO is of critical importance to the performance of any organization, including hospitals. Management systems and manager behaviours (traits) are of crucial importance to any organization because of their connection with organizational performance. To identify key factors associated with the quality of care delivered by hospitals, the authors gathered perceptions of manager traits from chief executive officers (CEOs) and followers in three groups of US hospitals delivering different levels of quality of care performance. Design/methodology/approach - Three high- and three low-performing hospitals were selected from the top and bottom 20th percentiles, respectively, using a national hospital ranking system based on standard quality of care performance measures. Three lean hospitals delivering intermediate performance were also selected. A survey was used to gather perceptions of manager traits (providing a modern or lean management system inclination) from CEOs and their followers in the three groups, which were compared. Findings - Four traits were found to be significantly different (alpha < 0.05) between lean (intermediate-) and low-performing hospitals. The different perceptions between these two hospital groups were all held by followers in the low-performing hospitals and not the CEOs, and all had a modern management inclination. No differences were found between lean (intermediate-) and high-performing hospitals, or between high- and low-performing hospitals. Originality/value - These findings support a need for hospital managers to acquire appropriate traits to achieve lean transformation, support a benefit of measuring manager traits to assess progress towards lean transformation and lend weight to improved quality of care that can be delivered by hospitals adopting a lean system of management.


Title #346: A qualitative evaluation of a pilot leadership programme for dentists.
PMID: 26083634
Authors: Jonathan J. Walsh, Nicholas N. Taylor, Donna D. Hough, Paul P. Brocklehurst
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to evaluate a pilot training programme run by Health Education North West to promote clinical leadership amongst general dental practitioners (GDPs). New powers and responsibilities for clinicians have caused a fundamental shift in the way that local services are planned and delivered in England. GDPs are being appointed onto the boards of local professional networks (LPNs) to influence the way that services are delivered at a local level. Analogous to clinical commissioning groups in medicine, the role of LPNs is to ensure that GDPs lead change and drive up the quality of service provision. Clinical leadership has been argued to be fundamentally important in these new structures, but has received little attention in the dental literature. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews and a focus group were held with participants of the pilot to explore their understanding and experience of clinical leadership. These were recorded, transcribed verbatim and underwent thematic analysis. Findings - Nineteen codes were identified and organized into four themes: nature of clinical leadership, challenges for clinical leaders in dentistry, Leadership Exploration and Discovery programme evaluation and future direction. Practical implications - The research provides an understanding of how GDPs conceptualise clinical leadership and provides recommendations for future leadership training programmes. Originality/value - This is the first evaluation of a leadership programme for GDPs and so helps address the paucity of evidence in the dental literature.


Title #347: Do we need medical leadership or medical engagement?
PMID: 26083633
Authors: Peter P. Spurgeon, Paul P. Long, John J. Clark, Frank F. Daly
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address issues of medical leadership within health systems and to clarify the associated conceptual issues, for example, leadership versus management and medical versus clinical leadership. However, its principle contribution is to raise the issue of the purpose or outcome of medical leadership, and, in this respect, it argues that it is to promote medical engagement. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to provide evidence, both from the literature and empirically, to suggest that enhanced medical engagement leads to improved organisational performance and, in doing so, to review the associated concepts. Findings - Building on current evidence from the UK and Australia, the authors strengthen previous findings that effective medical leadership underpins the effective organisational performance. Research limitations/implications - There is a current imbalance between the size of the databases on medical engagement between the UK (very large) and Australia (small but developing). Practical implications - The authors aim to equip medical leaders with the appropriate skill set to promote and enhance greater medical engagement. The focus of leaders in organisations should be in creating a culture that fosters and supports medical engagement. Social implications - This paper provides empowerment of medical professionals to have greater influence in the running of the organisation in which they deliver care. Originality/value - The paper contains, for the first time, linked performance data from the Care Quality Commission in the UK and from Australia with the new set of medical engagement findings.


Title #348: Effect of Incorporation of Pretreatment Serum Carcinoembryonic Antigen Levels Into AJCC Staging for Colon Cancer on 5-Year Survival.
PMID: 26083632
Authors: Pragatheeshwar P. Thirunavukarasu, Chetasi C. Talati, Sumeet S. Munjal, Kris K. Attwood, Stephen B SB. Edge, Valerie V. Francescutti
Abstract: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has proposed the inclusion of pretreatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (C stage) into the conventional TNM staging system of colon cancer. The latter proposal has yet to be widely adopted because of the lack of long-term survival estimates of after C-stage incorporation into AJCC staging.


Title #349: A Conserved Glycan in the C2 Domain of HIV-1 Envelope Acts as a Molecular Switch to Control X4 Utilization by Clonal Variants with Identical V3 Loops.
PMID: 26083631
Authors: Francesca F. Lombardi, Kyle J KJ. Nakamura, Thomas T. Chen, Edwin R ER. Sobrera, Nicole H NH. Tobin, Grace M GM. Aldrovandi
Abstract: Nearly all persons newly infected with HIV-1 harbor exclusively CCR5-using virus. CXCR4-using variants eventually arise in up to 50% of patients infected with subtypes B or D. This transition to efficient CXCR4 utilization is often co-incident with progression to AIDS. The basis for HIV-1's initial dependence on CCR5, the selective force(s) that drive CXCR4-utilization, and the evolutionary pathways by which it occurs are incompletely understood. Greater knowledge of these processes will inform interventions at all stages, from vaccination to cure. The determinants of co-receptor use map primarily, though not exclusively, to the V3 loop of gp120. In this study, we describe five clonal variants with identical V3 loops but divergent CXCR4 use. Mutagenesis revealed two residues controlling this phenotypic switch: a rare polymorphism in C1 and a highly conserved N-glycan in C2. To our knowledge, this is the first description of co-receptor usage regulated by the N-glycan at position 262.

Title #351: The Ketogenic Diet Alters the Hypoxic Response and Affects Expression of Proteins Associated with Angiogenesis, Invasive Potential and Vascular Permeability in a Mouse Glioma Model.
PMID: 26083629

Abstract: The successful treatment of malignant gliomas remains a challenge despite the current standard of care, which consists of surgery, radiation and temozolomide. Advances in the survival of brain cancer patients require the design of new therapeutic approaches that take advantage of common phenotypes such as the altered metabolism found in cancer cells. It has therefore been postulated that the high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate protein ketogenic diet (KD) may be useful in the treatment of brain tumors. We have demonstrated that the KD enhances survival and potentiates standard therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma, yet the mechanisms are not fully understood.


Title #352: The Impact of Dopant Segregation on the Maximum Carrier Density in Si:P.
PMID: 26083628
Authors: Joris G JG. Keizer, Sarah R SR. McKibbin, Michelle Y MY. Simmons
Abstract: Abrupt dopant profiles and low resistivity are highly sought after qualities in the silicon microelectronics industry and, more recently, in the development of an all epitaxial Si:P based quantum computer. By increasing the active carrier density in silicon to the point where the material becomes superconducting, whilst maintaining a low thermal budget it will be possible to fabricate nanoscale superconducting devices using the highly successful technique of depassivation lithography. In this work we investigate the dopant profile and activation in multiple high density Si:P delta-layers fabricated by stacking individual layers with intervening silicon growth. We determine that dopant activation is ultimately limited by the formation of P-P dimers due to the segregation of dopants between multi-layers. By increasing the encapsulation thickness between subsequent layers, thereby minimizing the formation of these deactivating defects, we are able to achieve an active carrier density of 4.5*10^14 cm^-2 for a triple layer. The results of electrical characterization are combined with those of secondary ion mass spectroscopy to construct a probability incorporation model that accurately describes the impact of P segregation on the final active carrier density in Si:P multi-layers. Our model predicts that a 3D active carrier density of 8.5*10^20 cm^-3 (1.7 atm. %) can be achieved.


Title #353: Differential Analysis of the Secretome of WRL68 Cells Infected with the Chikungunya Virus.
PMID: 26083627
Authors: Christina Li-Ping CL. Thio, Rohana R. Yusof, Ali A. Ashrafzadeh, Syareena S. Bahari, Puteri Shafinaz PS. Abdul-Rahman, Saiful Anuar SA. Karsani
Abstract: The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod borne virus. In the last 50 years, it has been the cause of numerous outbreaks in tropical and temperate regions, worldwide. There is limited understanding regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in CHIKV replication and how the virus interacts with its host. In the present study, comparative proteomics was used to identify secreted host proteins that changed in abundance in response to early CHIKV infection. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyse and compare the secretome profiles of WRL-68 cells infected with CHIKV against mock control WRL-68 cells. The analysis identified 25 regulated proteins in CHIKV infected cells. STRING network analysis was then used to predict biological processes that may be affected by these proteins. The processes predicted to be affected include signal transduction, cellular component and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, regulation of cytokine stimulus and immune response. These results provide an initial view of CHIKV may affect the secretome of infected cells during early infection. The results presented here will compliment earlier results from the study of late host response. However, functional characterization will be necessary to further enhance our understanding of the roles played by these proteins in the early stages of CHIKV infection in humans.


Title #354: Optimization of Drug Delivery by Drug-Eluting Stents.
PMID: 26083626
Authors: Franz F. Bozsak, David D. Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Zachary Z. Sternberger, Paul P. Belitz, Thomas T. Bewley, Jean-Marc JM. Chomaz, Abdul I AI. Barakat
Abstract: Drug-eluting stents (DES), which release anti-proliferative drugs into the arterial wall in a controlled manner, have drastically reduced the rate of in-stent restenosis and revolutionized the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, late stent thrombosis remains a safety concern in DES, mainly due to delayed healing of the endothelial wound inflicted during DES implantation. We present a framework to optimize DES design such that restenosis is inhibited without affecting the endothelial healing process. To this end, we have developed a computational model of fluid flow and drug transport in stented arteries and have used this model to establish a metric for quantifying DES performance. The model takes into account the multi-layered structure of the arterial wall and incorporates a reversible binding model to describe drug interaction with the cells of the arterial wall. The model is coupled to a novel optimization algorithm that allows identification of optimal DES designs. We show that optimizing the period of drug release from DES and the initial drug concentration within the coating has a drastic effect on DES performance. Paclitaxel-eluting stents perform optimally by releasing their drug either very rapidly (within a few hours) or very slowly (over periods of several months up to one year) at concentrations considerably lower than current DES. In contrast, sirolimus-eluting stents perform optimally only when drug release is slow. The results offer explanations for recent trends in the development of DES and demonstrate the potential for large improvements in DES design relative to the current state of commercial devices.


Title #355: Involvement of the heterodimeric interface region of the nucleotide binding domain-2 (NBD2) in the CFTR quaternary structure and membrane stability.
PMID: 26083625
Authors: Micoud M. Julien, Sylvain S. Chauvet, K E KE. Ludwig Scheckenbach, Nadia N. Alfaidy, Marc M. Chanson, Mohamed M. Benharouga
Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the only member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily that functions as a chloride channel. The predicted structure of CFTR protein contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), each followed by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2). The opening of the Cl(-) channel is directly linked to ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's NBD1 and NBD2 domains. The presence of a heterodimeric interfaces (HI) region in NBD1 and NBD2 generated a head to tail orientation necessary for channel activity. This process was also suggested to promote important conformational changes in the associated transmembrane domains of CFTR, which may impact the CFTR plasma membrane stability. To better understand the role of the individual HI region in this process, we generated recombinant CFTR protein with suppressed HI-NBD1 and HI-NBD2. Our results indicate that HI-NBD2 deletion leads to the loss of the dimerization profile of CFTR that affect its plasma membrane stability. We conclude that, in addition to its role in Cl(-) transport, HI-NBD2 domain confers membrane stability of CFTR by consolidating its quaternary structure through interactions with HI-NBD1 region.


Title #356: Pre-stress Driven Improvement in Fracture Behavior of In Situ Sputtered Zinc Oxide Thin Films on Stretched Polymer Substrates.
PMID: 26083624
Authors: Hong Rak HR. Choi, Senthil Kumar SK. Eswaran, Yong Soo YS. Cho
Abstract: Flexible electronic devices need to survive bending or stretching operation without mechanical failure. If inorganic thin films are involved in the device structure, the evolution of cracks is a major challenge to overcome. Here, we report a novel way to improve substantially the fracture behavior of films that are based on intentional utilization of residual stress on the films by in situ sputtering on a stretched polymer substrate. The in situ sputtering combined with a stabilization stage yielded ZnO:Al thin films with a nearly two-fold improvement in crack initiation strain, which indicates greater resistance to bending. The critical strain of the optimal ZnO:Al films was ~1.83 %, which is a significant improvement compared to the current tolerance value of ~1 %. This was accompanied by a ~300 % improvement in fracture energy. We attributed the improved fracture behavior to the presence of residual compressive stresses, which creates a barrier for crack formation by acting oppositely to the applied bending strain.

Title #358: Illumination angle insensitive single indium phosphide tapered nanopillar solar cell.
PMID: 26083622
Authors: Wai Son WS. Ko, Thai-Truong Duc TT. Tran, Indrasen I. Bhattacharya, Kar Wei KW. Ng, Hao H. Sun, Connie J CJ. Chang-Hasnain
Abstract: Low cost, high efficiency photovoltaic can help accelerate the adoption of solar energy. Using tapered Indium Phosphide nanopillars grown on a silicon substrate, we demonstrate a single nanopillar photovoltaic exhibiting illumination angle insensitive response. The photovoltaic employs a novel regrown core-shell p-i-n junction to improve device performance by eliminating shunt current paths, resulting in a high VOC of 0.534 V and a power conversion efficiency of 19.6%. Enhanced broadband light absorption is also demonstrated over a wide spectral range of 400-800 nm.


Title #359: How well are lesbians treated in UK fertility clinics?
PMID: 26083621
Authors: Helen H. Priddle
Abstract: Legislation regulating fertility treatment in the United Kingdom originally discouraged treatment without a father, resulting in many clinics denying access to lesbian couples. Lesbians now enjoy rights to legal union, dual parenthood and protection against discrimination. Consequently, increasing numbers seek fertility treatment. This is a growing stakeholder group, but it is unknown whether UK licensed centres are serving them adequately. Data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority suggests live birth rates after in vitro fertilisation for lesbians is comparable to estimates for natural attempt at pregnancy for heterosexuals, whereas success rates with donor insemination are lower. Unsurprisingly, live birth rates for lesbians after in vitro fertilisation are higher compared with heterosexual couples (the latter attending with fertility issues). However, outcomes for lesbians after donor insemination are slightly lower, potentially due to increased female age. Rather than adopting a one-heterosexual-size-fits-all approach, lesbian couples may benefit from new treatment pathways. They also have a different experience of fertility treatment, some reporting a wish to be presumed fertile rather than medicalised, and others encountering heterosexism by fertility professionals. Additionally, some lesbians with known fertility issues have needed to resort to legal action to obtain the publicly funded treatment they are entitled to.


Title #360: Prevalence and Characteristics of Overweight and Obesity in Indigenous Australian Children: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 26083620
Authors: Suzanne Marie SM. Dyer, Judith Streak JS. Gomersall, Lisa Gaye LG. Smithers, Carol C. Davy, Dylan T DT. Coleman, Jackie Mary JM. Street
Abstract: Evidence-based profiling of obesity and overweight in Indigenous Australian children has been poor. This study systematically reviewed evidence of the prevalence and patterns of obesity/overweight, with respect to gender, age, remoteness and birth weight, in Indigenous Australian children, 0-18Â years (PROSPERO CRD42014007626). Study quality and risk of bias were assessed. 25 publications (21 studies) met inclusion criteria, with large variations in prevalence for obesity or overweight (11% to 54%) reported. A high degree of heterogeneity in study design was observed, few studies (6/21) were representative of the target population, and few appropriately recruited Indigenous children (8/21). Variability in study design, conduct and small sample sizes mean that it is not possible to derive a single estimate for prevalence although two high-quality studies indicate at least one in four Indigenous Australian children are overweight or obese. Four of six studies reporting on gender, found overweight/obesity higher in girls and eight studies reporting on overweight/obesity by age suggest prevalence increases with age with one high quality large national study reporting total overweight/obesity as 22.4% of children aged 2-4Â years, 27.5% of those aged 5-9, 38.5% aged 10-14 and 36.3% aged 15-17. Three of four studies, reporting obesity/overweight by region, found lower rates for children living in more remote areas than urban areas.


Title #361: Is Spousal Violence Being "Vertically Transmitted" through Victims? Findings from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012-13.
PMID: 26083619
Authors: Syeda S. Kanwal Aslam, Sidra S. Zaheer, Kashif K. Shafique
Abstract: Violence against women is regarded as a major violation of human rights, and several socio-behavioral aspects among victims have been identified as important determinants of spousal violence experience. Pakistani nationally representative contextual evidence is scarce in this regard. We aimed to estimate prevalence of spousal violence, and explore its association with intergenerational transfer, and attitudinal acceptance of violence, among Pakistani ever-married women.

Abstract: Longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC) bears a high risk for development of UC-associated colorectal carcinoma (UCC). The inflammatory microenvironment influences microRNA expression, which in turn deregulates target gene expression. microRNA-26b (miR-26b) was shown to be instrumental in normal tissue growth and differentiation. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of miR-26b in inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves dysregulation of mucosal immunity in response to environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The bacterial microbiota is often altered in IBD, but the connection to disease is not fully clarified and gut fungi have recently been suggested to play a role as well. In this study, we compared microbes from all 3 domains of life-bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota-in pediatric patients with IBD and healthy controls.

Abstract: Recent cross-sectional studies suggest that restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity or risk factors. We evaluated whether primary or secondary RLS was associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease in a retrospective cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC).


Title #367: The Origin and Early Radiation of Archosauriforms: Integrating the Skeletal and Footprint Record.
PMID: 26083612
Authors: Massimo M. Bernardi, Hendrik H. Klein, Fabio Massimo FM. Petti, MartÃ­n D MD. Ezcurra
Abstract: We present a holistic approach to the study of early archosauriform evolution by integrating body and track records. The ichnological record supports a Late Permian-Early Triassic radiation of archosauriforms not well documented by skeletal material, and new footprints from the Upper Permian of the southern Alps (Italy) provide evidence for a diversity not yet sampled by body fossils. The integrative study of body fossil and footprint data supports the hypothesis that archosauriforms had already undergone substantial taxonomic diversification by the Late Permian and that by the Early Triassic archosauromorphs attained a broad geographical distribution over most parts of Pangea. Analysis of body size, as deduced from track size, suggests that archosauriform average body size did not change significantly from the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. A survey of facies yielding both skeletal and track record indicate an ecological preference for inland fluvial (lacustrine) environments for early archosauromorphs. Finally, although more data is needed, Late Permian chirotheriid imprints suggest a shift from sprawling to erect posture in archosauriforms before the end-Permian mass extinction event. We highlight the importance of approaching palaeobiological questions by using all available sources of data, specifically through integrating the body and track fossil record.


Title #368: Gender-Specific Associations between Circulating T-Cadherin and High Molecular Weight-Adiponectin in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease.
PMID: 26083608
Authors: Andreas W AW. Schoenenberger, Dennis D. Pfaff, Boris B. Dasen, Agne A. Frismantiene, Paul P. Erne, Therese J TJ. Resink, Maria M. Philippova
Abstract: Close relationships exist between presence of adiponectin (APN) within vascular tissue and expression of T-cadherin (T-cad) on vascular cells. APN and T-cad are also present in the circulation but here their relationships are unknown. This study investigates associations between circulating levels of high molecular weight APN (HMW-APN) and T-cad in a population comprising 66 women and 181 men with angiographically proven stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Plasma HMW-APN and T-cad were measured by ELISA and analysed for associations with baseline clinical characteristics and with each other. In multivariable analysis BMI and HDL were independently associated with HMW-APN in both genders, while diabetes and extent of coronary stenosis were independently associated with T-cad in males only. Regression analysis showed no significant association between HMW-APN and T-cad in the overall study population. However, there was a negative association between HMW-APN and T-cad (P=0.037) in a subgroup of young men (age <60 years, had no diabetes and no or 1-vessel CAD) which persisted after multivariable analysis with adjustment for all potentially influential variables (P=0.021). In the corresponding subgroup of women there was a positive association between HMW-APN and T-cad (P=0.013) which disappeared after adjustment for HDL. After exclusion of the young men, a positive association (P=0.008) between HMW-APN and T-cad was found for the remaining participants of the overall population which disappeared after adjustment for HDL and BMI. The existence of opposing correlations between circulating HMW-APN and T-cad in male and female patient populations underscores the necessity to consider gender as a confounding variable when evaluating biomarker potentials of APN and T-cad.


Title #369: Validating precision - how many measurements do we need?
PMID: 26083607
Authors: Arne A. ÃSberg, Kristine Bodal KB. Solem, Gustav G. Mikkelsen
Abstract: A quantitative analytical method should be sufficiently precise, i.e. the imprecision measured as a standard deviation should be less than the numerical definition of the acceptable standard deviation. We propose that the entire 90% confidence interval for the true standard deviation shall lie below the numerical definition of the acceptable standard deviation in order to assure that the analytical method is sufficiently precise. We also present power function curves to ease the decision on the number of measurements to make.

PMID: 26083600
Authors: Fabiana M FM. Flores, Frederico F. Dagnese, Carlos B CB. Mota, Fernando F. Copetti
Abstract: Hippotherapy uses horseback riding movements for therapeutic purposes. In addition to the horse's movement, the choice of equipment and types of floor are also useful in the intervention. The quantification of dynamic parameters that define the interaction of the surface of contact between horse and rider provides insight into how the type of floor surface variations act upon the subject's postural control.


Title #377: Functional Expression and Characterization of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Avt3p as a Vacuolar Amino Acid Exporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PMID: 26083598

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Avt3p and Avt4p mediate the extrusion of several amino acids from the vacuolar lumen into the cytosol. SpAvt3p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a homologue of these vacuolar amino acid transporters, has been indicated to be involved in spore formation. In this study, we confirmed that GFP-SpAvt3p localized to the vacuolar membrane in S. pombe. The amounts of various amino acids increased significantly in the vacuolar pool of avt3Î cells, but decreased in that of avt3+-overexpressing avt3Î cells. These results suggest that SpAvt3p participates in the vacuolar compartmentalization of amino acids in S. pombe. To examine the export activity of SpAvt3p, we expressed the avt3+ gene in S. cerevisiae cells. We found that the heterologously overproduced GFP-SpAvt3p localized to the vacuolar membrane in S. cerevisiae. Using the vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from avt3+-overexpressing S. cerevisiae cells, we detected the export activities of alanine and tyrosine in an ATP-dependent manner. These activities were inhibited by the addition of a V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A, thereby suggesting that the activity of SpAvt3p is dependent on a proton electrochemical gradient generated by the action of V-ATPase. In addition, the amounts of various amino acids in the vacuolar pools of S. cerevisiae cells were decreased by the overproduction of SpAvt3p, which indicated that SpAvt3p was functional in S. cerevisiae cells. Thus, SpAvt3p is a vacuolar transporter that is involved in the export of amino acids from S. pombe vacuoles.


Title #378: Automated High-Throughput Characterization of Single Neurons by Means of Simplified Spiking Models.
PMID: 26083597
Authors: Christian C. Pozzorini, Skander S. Mensi, Olivier O. Hagens, Richard R. Naud, Christof C. Koch, Wulfram W. Gerstner
Abstract: Single-neuron models are useful not only for studying the emergent properties of neural circuits in large-scale simulations, but also for extracting and summarizing in a principled way the information contained in electrophysiological recordings. Here we demonstrate that, using a convex optimization procedure we previously introduced, a Generalized Integrate-and-Fire model can be accurately fitted with a limited amount of data. The model is capable of predicting both the spiking activity and the subthreshold dynamics of different cell types, and can be used for online characterization of neuronal properties. A protocol is proposed that, combined with emergent technologies for automatic patch-clamp recordings, permits automated, in vitro high-throughput characterization of single neurons.

Title #380: Isolating gait-related movement artifacts in electroencephalography during human walking.
PMID: 26083595
Authors: Julia E JE. Kline, Helen J HJ. Huang, Kristine L KL. Snyder, Daniel P DP. Ferris
Abstract: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide an insight into human brain function during real-world activities with walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize brain activity during walking, but the relative contributions of movement artifact and electrocortical activity have been difficult to quantify. We aimed to characterize movement artifact recorded by EEG electrodes at a range of walking speeds and to test the efficacy of artifact removal methods. We also quantified the similarity between movement artifact recorded by EEG electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer.


Title #381: Comparison of aspirin and indobufen in healthy volunteers.
PMID: 26083594
Authors: Jong-Young JY. Lee, Ki-Chul KC. Sung, Hyo-In HI. Choi
Abstract: The aim of this study is to quantify the extent and recovery of platelet inhibition after administration of indobufen and aspirin in healthy volunteers. Indobufen inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly inhibiting the platelet cyclooxygenase enzyme, thereby suppressing thromboxane synthesis. Twenty healthy volunteers completed the study and received aspirin (200âmg/day for 2 weeks) followed by a 4-week washout period and then indobufen (200âmg twice a day for 2 weeks). The percent (%) inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) was assessed using arachidonic acid (0.5âmg/ml) and adenosine diphosphate (5âÂµM) at 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours after last dose of each drug. IPA assessed using arachidonic acid as the agonist was similar at 4 hours after the last dose of indobufen (81.07âÂ±â9.36%) and aspirin (96.99âÂ±â0.29%, pâ=â0.10), but significantly lower at 12 hours (74.04âÂ±â9.55% vs. 97.94âÂ±â0.28%, pâ=â0.02), 24 hours (33.39âÂ±â11.13% vs. 97.48âÂ±â0.32%, pâ<â0.001) and 48 hours (14.12âÂ±â9.74% vs. 98.22âÂ±â0.31%, pâ<â0.001) after indobufen, compared to the relative values for aspirin. IPA assessed using adenosine diphosphate as the agonist was similar in the two groups at 4, 12 and 24 hours after the last dose, but significantly lower 48 hours after the last dose of indobufen, compared to the relative value for aspirin (1.98âÂ±â3.57% vs. 12.61âÂ±â2.71%, pâ=â0.002). Indobufen (200âmg twice a day) caused equivalent initial inhibition of platelet aggregation to aspirin (200âmg daily), and the anti-aggregation effect diminished faster than after aspirin.

Title #383: Spectroscopic and structural characterization of three silaisocyanides: exploring an elusive class of reactive molecules at high resolution.
PMID: 26083592
Authors: Sven S. Thorwirth, Ralf I RI. Kaiser, Kyle N KN. Crabtree, Michael C MC. McCarthy
Abstract: Silaisocyanoacetylene, HCCNSi, silaisocyanodiacetylene, HC4NSi, and silaisocyanogen, NCNSi, have been identified spectroscopically for the first time. All three transient species were observed at high spectral resolution at centimeter wavelengths (5-40 GHz) by microwave spectroscopy. From detection of less abundant isotopic species and high-level quantum-chemical calculations, accurate empirical equilibrium structures have been derived for HCCNSi and NCNSi. All three molecules are promising candidates for future radio astronomical detection owing in part to large calculated dipole moments.


Title #384: Blood-Based Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Infections in.
PMID: 26083591
Authors: William J WJ. Steinbach
Abstract: The cornerstone to improving outcomes in invasive fungal infections in children is early, accurate diagnosis. With the sensitivity of blood culture for candidemia estimated to be approximately 50%, and the likelihood of Aspergillus growing in culture from bronchoalveolar lavage even worse, newer molecular fungal biomarkers are paramount to achieving that overall clinical goal. Often the patients at risk for invasive fungal infections are fragile enough that a blood-based strategy is all that can be safely employed. This brief review will highlight newer developments and thoughts focused only on blood-based fungal biomarkers for immunocompromised children.

Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common bacteria causing acute otitis media (AOM). In Japan, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced for voluntary vaccination of children in 2010, and it became a recommended vaccination in April 2013. We surveyed the serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of S. pneumoniae isolates obtained from the middle ear fluid of Japanese children with AOM.


Title #386: Pertussis Across the Globe: Recent Epidemiologic Trends From 2000-2013.

Abstract: Pertussis has reemerged as a problem across the world. To better understand the nature of the resurgence, we reviewed recent epidemiologic data and we report disease trends from across the world. Published epidemiologic data from January 2000 to July 2013 were obtained via PubMed searches and open-access websites. Data on vaccine coverage and reported pertussis cases from 2000 through 2012 from the 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions were also reviewed. Findings are confounded by the lack of systematic and comparable observations in many areas of the world, but also by the cyclic nature of pertussis with peaks occurring every 3 to 5 years. It appears that pertussis incidence has increased in school-age children in North America and western Europe, where acellular pertussis vaccines are used, but an increase has also occurred in some countries that use whole-cell vaccines. Worldwide, pertussis remains a serious health concern, especially for infants, who bear the greatest disease burden. Factors that may contribute to the resurgence include lack of booster immunizations, low vaccine coverage, improved diagnostic methods, and genetic changes in the organism. To better understand the epidemiology of pertussis and optimize disease control, it is important to improve surveillance worldwide, irrespective of pertussis vaccine types and schedules used in each country.

Title #391: RhoA-mediated FMNL1 regulates GM130 for actin assembly and phosphorylates MAPK for spindle formation in mouse oocyte meiosis.
PMID: 26083584
Authors: Fei F. Wang, Liang L. Zhang, Xing X. Duan, Guang-Li GL. Zhang, Zhen-Bo ZB. Wang, Qiang Q. Wang, Bo B. Xiong, Shao-Chen SC. Sun
Abstract: Formin-like 1 (FMNL1) is a member of Formin family proteins which are the actin nucleators. Although FMNL1 activities have been shown to be essential for cell adhesion, cytokinesis, cell polarization and migration in mitosis, the functional roles of mammalian FMNL1 during oocyte meiosis remain uncertain. In this study, we investigated the functions of FMNL1 in mouse oocytes using specific morpholino (MO) microinjection and live cell imaging. Immunofluorescent staining showed that in addition to its cytoplasmic distribution, FMNL1 was primarily localized at the spindle poles after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). FMNL1 knockdown caused the low rate of polar body extrusion and resulted in large polar bodies. Time-lapse microscopic and immunofluorescence intensity analysis indicated that this might be due to the aberrant actin expression levels. Cortical polarity was disrupted as shown by a loss of actin cap and cortical granule free domain (CGFD) formation, which was confirmed by a failure of meiotic spindle positioning. And this might be the reason for the large polar body formation. Spindle formation was also disrupted, which might be due to the abnormal localization of p-MAPK. These results indicated that FMNL1 affected both actin dynamics and spindle formation for the oocyte polar body extrusion. Moreover, FMNL1 depletion resulted in aberrant localization and expression patterns of a cis-Golgi marker protein, GM130. Finally, we found that the small GTPase RhoA might be the upstream regulator of FMNL1. Taken together, our data indicate that FMNL1 is required for spindle organization and actin assembly through a RhoA-FMNL1/GM130 pathway during mouse oocyte meiosis.


Title #392: Molecular Sensing with Hyperpolarized (129) Xe Using Switchable Chemical Exchange Relaxation Transfer.
PMID: 26083583
Authors: Francesco F. Zamberlan, ClÃ©mentine C. Lesbats, Nicola J NJ. Rogers, James L JL. Krupa, Galina E GE. Pavlovskaya, Neil R NR. Thomas, Henryk M HM. Faas, Thomas T. Meersmann
Abstract: An approach for hyperpolarized (129) Xe molecular sensors is explored using paramagnetic relaxation agents that can be deactivated upon chemical or enzymatic reaction with an analyte. Cryptophane encapsulated (129) Xe within the vicinity of the paramagnetic center experiences fast relaxation that, through chemical exchange of xenon atoms between cage and solvent pool, causes accelerated hyperpolarized (129) Xe signal decay in the dissolved phase. In this proof-of-concept work, the relaxivity of Gadolinium(III) -DOTA on (129) Xe in the solvent was increased eightfold through tethering of the paramagnetic molecule to a cryptophane cage. This potent relaxation agent can be 'turned off' specifically for (129) Xe through chemical reactions that spatially separate the Gd(III) centre from the attached cryptophane cage. Unlike (129) Xe chemical shift based sensors, the new concept does not require high spectral resolution and may lead to a new generation of responsive contrast agents for molecular MRI.

Title #394: Mechanical and structural comparison between primary tumor and lymph node metastasis cells in colorectal cancer.

Abstract: SW480 and SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines derive from primary tumour and lymph-node metastasis of the same patient, respectively. For this reason, these cells represent an ideal system to analyse phenotypic variations associated with the metastatic process. In this study we analysed SW480 and SW620 cytoskeleton remodelling by measuring the cells' mechanics and morphological properties using different microscopic techniques. We observed that different specialized functions of cells, i.e. the capacity to metastasize of elongated cells inside the primary tumour and the ability to intravasate and resist shear forces of the stream of cells derived from lymph node metastasis, are reflected in their mechanical properties. We demonstrated that, together with stiffness and adhesion between the AFM tip and the cell surface, cell shape, actin organization and surface roughness are strictly related and are finely modulated by colorectal cancer cells to better accomplish their specific tasks in cancer growth and invasion.


Title #395: Magnetic Shielding in and Around Oxazole, Imidazole and Thiazole: How Does the Second Heteroatom Affect Aromaticity and Bonding?
PMID: 26083580
Authors: Kate E KE. Horner, Peter B PB. Karadakov
Abstract: The isotropic magnetic shielding distributions in the regions of space surrounding oxazole, imidazole and thiazole are used to investigate aromaticity and bonding in these five-membered heterocycles with two heteroatoms. This is achieved by constructing HF-GIAO and MP2-GIAO (Hartree-Fock and second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory with gauge-including atomic orbitals) isotropic shielding plots, within the 6-311++G(d,p) basis, using regular two-dimensional 0.05 A grids in the molecular plane and in planes 0.5 A and 1 A above it. The extent of isotropic shielding delocalization in the contour plots in planes 1 A above the molecular plane, a new sensitive two-dimensional aromaticity criterion, indicates that aromaticity decreases in the order thiazole > imidazole > oxazole; in combination with previous results on furan, pyrrole and thiophene (J. Org. Chem. 2013, 78, 8037-9043) the aromaticity ordering in the six five-membered heterocycles becomes thiophene > thiazole > pyrrole > imidazole > furan > oxazole. The results suggest that the inclusion of a second heteroatom in a five-membered heterocycle has a detrimental effect on its aromaticity which is very minor in oxazole, when compared to furan, and small but noticeable in imidazole and pyrrole, and in thiazole and thiophene.


Title #396: TNFÎ± mediates stress-induced depression by upregulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in a mouse model of unpredictable chronic mild stress.
PMID: 26083579

Abstract: Depression is often preceded by exposure to stressful life events. Chronic stress causes perturbations in the immune system, and up-regulates production of proinflammatory cytokines, which has been proposed to be associated with the pathogenesis of clinical depression. However, the potential mechanisms by which stress-induced proinflammatory cytokines lead to the development of depression are not well understood. Here, we sought to screen the main proinflammatory cytokines and the potential mechanisms linking inflammation to depression-like behavior during unpredictable, chronic, mild stress (UCMS), in vivo. Mice were allocated into four groups in each separate experiment: saline-control, saline-UCMS, drug-control and drug-UCMS. Development of depression-like behavior was reflected as a reduction in sucrose preference, and increased immobility in both the forced swim and tail suspension tests. The following drugs were administered intraperitoneally: the pan-anti-inflammatory tetracycline derivative, minocycline (30Â mg/kg, daily), the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)Î± monoclonal antibody, infliximab (10Â mg/kg, twice weekly), and the indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT, 10 mg/mouse, daily). Plasma TNFÎ±, IL-1Î² and IL-18 increased significantly after the four-week UCMS exposure. Pretreatment of mice with minocycline completely blocked any upregulation. Concurrent with development of depression-like behaviors, the concentration of TNFÎ± in plasma and the cerebral cortex increased remarkably. The tryptophan-degrading enzyme IDO was up-regulated in the cortex following UCMS exposure. Treatment of mice with minocycline, infliximab or 1-MT prevented the development of depression-like behaviors. Furthermore, blockade of TNFÎ± inhibited expression of IDO and protected cortical neurons from UCMS-induced damage. These results suggest that TNFÎ± plays a critical role in mediating UCMS-induced depression through up-regulation of IDO and subsequent damage of cortical neurons.

Abstract: Magnesium is highly involved in the metabolic network such that even subtle disturbances in its homeostasis affect many cellular functions, including calcium homeostasis, signal transduction, energy metabolism, membrane stability and cell proliferation. Recently, magnesium level has been proposed to modulate the priming and activity of immune cells. We studied the behavior of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T lymphocytes after altering the magnesium/calcium balance. We used two different populations of primary APCs, i.e. bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages, while D10.G4.1 cells served as a model of responding Th2 cells. Our principal findings are the following: (i) the extracellular magnesium concentration had no significant impact on endocytosis by bone marrow-derived APCs, (ii) high concentrations of extracellular magnesium, with or without calcium antagonists, significantly decreased IL-4 and IL-10 secretion by Th2 cells in a co-culture system of APCs and Th2 lymphocytes, (iii) proliferation of Th2 cells in co-culture systems was significantly inhibited by calcium antagonists independently from extracellular magnesium concentrations. Our results suggest that alterations of magnesium and calcium homeostasis impact on some crucial steps of the immune response.


Title #398: Influences of extent of conjugation on the aggregation-induced emission quantum efficiency in silole derivatives - A computational study.
PMID: 26083577
Authors: Zhigang Z. Shuai, Qian Q. Peng, Yujun Y. Xie, Tian T. Zhang, Zhen Z. Li, Yuanping Y. Yi
Abstract: The photophysical properties of a series of silole derivatives, with hydrogen (TPS), bromine (BrTPS), and conjugated phenyl (HPS), triphenylsilyethynyl (BTPES) and dimethylfluorene (BFTPS) substituents at 2, 5-positions in both gas and aggregate phases have been investigated computationally by employing the correlation function rate formalism coupled with hybrid quantum/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. It is found that the solid-state fluorescence quantum efficiency first increases sharply with the degree of -conjugation of the 2, 5-substituents, then levels off, and finally starts to decrease slightly. This is because that the side-group conjugation tends to enhance the radiative decay rate in both gas and solid phases. However,futher increase of conjugation leads to saturation in the radiative decay rate but increases the non-raditiave decay rate due to the decreased energy gap.


Title #399: Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) Is Regulated by Food Intake, Improves Glucose Tolerance and Induces Mucinous Metaplasia.

Abstract: Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), also called intestinal trefoil factor or Itf, is a 59 amino acid peptide found as a homodimer predominantly along the gastrointestinal tract and in serum. TFF3 expression is elevated during gastrointestinal adenoma progression and has been shown to promote mucosal wound healing. Here we show that in contrast to other trefoil factor family members, TFF1 and TFF2, TFF3 is highly expressed in mouse duodenum, jejunum and ileum and that its expression is regulated by food intake. Overexpression of TFF3 using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, or daily administration of recombinant TFF3 protein in vivo improved glucose tolerance in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Body weight, fasting insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol and leptin levels were not affected by TFF3 treatment. Induction of mucinous metaplasia was observed in mice with AAV-mediated TFF3 overexpression, however, no such adverse histological effect was seen after the administration of recombinant TFF3 protein. Altogether these results suggest that the therapeutic potential of targeting TFF3 to treat T2D may be limited.


Title #400: Potential therapeutic targets for sepsis in women.
PMID: 26083575
Authors: Maximilian M. Weniger, Jan G JG. D'Haese, Martin K MK. Angele, Irshad H IH. Chaudry
Abstract: Gender is increasingly recognized as a key factor in trauma and sepsis. Multiple clinical and experimental studies on sepsis have shown a distinct advantage of females in the proestrus cycle to survive sepsis compared with age-matched males. In addition, estrogen treatment is beneficial in non-proestrus cycles and also in ovarectomized females. In this manuscript, the effects of gender and sex hormones in sepsis are summarized and potential gender-specific therapeutic strategies in women are evaluated. Areas covered: This review comprises current clinical studies on the effect of gender in sepsis and gives an overview on gender and sex hormone-related effects on immune cells and organ function. Based on clinical and experimental data, potential therapeutic targets are presented. Expert opinion: Estrogens and estrogen-receptor agonists have been extensively shown to be beneficial in the setting of sepsis. Clinical data, however, do not clearly support their therapeutic use. This discrepancy appears to be mainly due to insufficient study design in clinical trials conducted up to now. Therefore, improved study protocols with exact analysis of the patients' hormonal status are needed to clarify the role of gender and sex hormones in trauma and sepsis.


Title #401: The inner and outer of our thorax: silicone breast implants and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
PMID: 26083574

Abstract: Pulmonary alveolar (phospholipo)proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease, predominantly autoimmune in nature. This case report describes a patient with insidious dyspnoea since 5â£years and a milky appearance of her bronchoalveolar fluid, leading to the diagnosis of PAP. The onset of symptoms coincided with an exchange of her silicone breast implants. Giant cell reaction in axillary adenopathies pointed towards silicone leakage. Adjuvants, such as silicone, might boost pre-existing antigen reactions of the immune system, potentially leading to autoimmune phenomena.


Title #402: Sex Differences in Spatial Memory in Brown-Headed Cowbirds: Males Outperform Females on a Touchscreen Task.
PMID: 26083573
Authors: MÃ©lanie F MF. Guigueno, Scott A SA. MacDougall-Shackleton, David F DF. Sherry
Abstract: Spatial cognition in females and males can differ in species in which there are sex-specific patterns in the use of space. Brown-headed cowbirds are brood parasites that show a reversal of sex-typical space use often seen in mammals. Female cowbirds, search for, revisit and parasitize hosts nests, have a larger hippocampus than males and have better memory than males for a rewarded location in an open spatial environment. In the current study, we tested female and male cowbirds in breeding and non-breeding conditions on a touchscreen delayed-match-to-sample task using both spatial and colour stimuli. Our goal was to determine whether sex differences in spatial memory in cowbirds generalizes to all spatial tasks or is task-dependant. Both sexes performed better on the spatial than on the colour touchscreen task. On the spatial task, breeding males outperformed breeding females. On the colour task, females and males did not differ, but females performed better in breeding condition than in non-breeding condition. Although female cowbirds were observed to outperform males on a previous larger-scale spatial task, males performed better than females on a task testing spatial memory in the cowbirds' immediate visual field. Spatial abilities in cowbirds can favour males or females depending on the type of spatial task, as has been observed in mammals, including humans.


Title #403: Incidence of bradycardia at arrival to the operating room after oral or intravenous premedication with clonidine in children.
PMID: 26083572
Authors: Peter G PG. Larsson, Staffan S. Eksborg, Per-Arne PA. LÃ¶nnqvist
Abstract: Clonidine has been advocated as a valid alternative for premedication in children but one of the few limitations is its association with reduced heart rate (HR), which thus raises the question of the safety of clonidine as premedication in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of bradycardia in children premedicated with oral or intravenous clonidine as compared to children not receiving pharmacologic premedication.


Title #404: KIAA1549: BRAF Gene Fusion and FGFR1 Hotspot Mutations Are Prognostic Factors in Pilocytic Astrocytomas.
PMID: 26083571

Abstract: Up to 20% of patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) experience a poor outcome. BRAF alterations and Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) point mutations are key molecular alterations in Pas, but their clinical implications are not established. We aimed to determine the frequency and prognostic role of these alterations in a cohort of 69 patients with PAs. We assessed KIAA1549:BRAF fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization and BRAF (exon 15) mutations by capillary sequencing. In addition, FGFR1 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and this was compared with gene amplification and hotspot mutations (exons 12 and 14) assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and capillary sequencing. KIAA1549:BRAF fusion was identified in almost 60% of cases. Two tumors harbored mutated BRAF. Despite high FGFR1 expression overall, no cases had FGFR1 amplifications. Three cases harbored a FGFR1 p.K656E point mutation. No correlation was observed between BRAF and FGFR1 alterations. The cases were predominantly pediatric (87%), and no statistical differences were observed in molecular alterations-related patient ages. In summary, we confirmed the high frequency of KIAA1549:BRAF fusion in PAs and its association with a better outcome. Oncogenic mutations of FGFR1, although rare, occurred in a subset of patients with worse outcome. These molecular alterations may constitute alternative targets for novel clinical approaches, when radical surgical resection is unachievable.


Title #405: Targeting Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1Î± in a New Orthotopic Model of Glioblastoma Recapitulating the Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment.

Abstract: Tissue hypoxia and necrosis represent pathophysiologic and histologic hallmarks of glioblastoma (GBM). Although hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±) plays crucial roles in the malignant phenotypes of GBM, developing HIF-1Î±-targeted agents has been hampered by the lack of a suitable preclinical model that recapitulates the complex biology of clinical GBM. We present a new GBM model, MGG123, which was established from a recurrent human GBM. Orthotopic xenografting of stem-like MGG123 cells reproducibly generated lethal tumors that were characterized by foci of palisading necrosis, hypervascularity, and robust stem cell marker expression. Perinecrotic neoplastic cells distinctively express HIF-1Î± and are proliferative in both xenografts and the patient tissue. The xenografts contain scattered hypoxic foci that were consistently greater than 50 Î¼m distant from blood vessels, indicating intratumoral heterogeneity of oxygenation. Hypoxia enhanced HIF-1Î± expression in cultured MGG123 cells, which was abrogated by the HIF-1Î± inhibitors digoxin or ouabain. In vivo, treatment of orthotopic MGG123 xenografts with digoxin decreased HIF-1Î± expression, vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels, and CD34-positive vasculature within the tumors, and extended survival of mice bearing the aggressive MGG123 GBM. This preclinical tumor model faithfully recapitulates the GBM-relevant hypoxic microenvironment and stemness and is a suitable platform for studying disease biology and developing hypoxia-targeted agents.


Title #406: Neuropathologic Characterization of Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6 Associated With Cardiomyopathy and Hydrops Fetalis and Severe Multisystem Respiratory Chain Deficiency due to Novel RARS2 Mutations.

Abstract: Autosomal recessive mutations in the RARS2 gene encoding the mitochondrial arginyl-transfer RNA synthetase cause infantile-onset myoencephalopathy pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6). We describe 2 sisters with novel compound heterozygous RARS2 mutations who presented perinatally with neurologic features typical of PCH6 but with additional features including cardiomyopathy, hydrops, and pulmonary hypoplasia and who died at 1 day and 14 days of age. Magnetic resonance imaging findings included marked cerebellar hypoplasia, gyral immaturity, punctate lesions in cerebral white matter, and unfused deep cerebral grey matter. Enzyme histochemistry of postmortem tissues revealed a near-global cytochrome c oxidase-deficiency; assessment of respiratory chain enzyme activities confirmed severe deficiencies involving complexes I, III, and IV. Molecular genetic studies revealed 2 RARS2 gene mutations: a c.1A>G, p.? variant predicted to abolish the initiator methionine, and a deep intronic c.613-3927C>T variant causing skipping of exons 6-8 in the mature RARS2 transcript. Neuropathologic investigation included low brain weights, small brainstem and cerebellum, deep cerebral white matter pathology, pontine nucleus neuron loss (in 1 sibling), and peripheral nerve pathology. Mitochondrial respiratory chain immunohistochemistry in brain tissues confirmed an absence of complexes I and IV immunoreactivity with sparing of mitochondrial numbers. These cases expand the clinical spectrum of RARS2 mutations, including antenatal features and widespread mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies in postmortem brain tissues.


Title #407: Cerebrospinal Fluid Particles in Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease.

Abstract: Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains diverse lipid particles, including lipoproteins that are distinct from their plasma counterparts and contain apolipoprotein (apo) E isoforms, apoJ, and apoAI, and extracellular vesicles, which can be detected by annexin V binding. The aim of this study was to develop a method to quantify CSF particles and evaluate their relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We used a flow cytometric assay to detect annexin V-, apoE-, apoAI-, apoJ-, and amyloid (A) Î²42-positive particles in CSF from 131 research volunteers who were neurologically normal or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, or Parkinson disease. APOE Îµ4/Îµ4 participants had CSF apoE-positive particles that were more frequently larger but at an 88% lower level versus those in APOE Îµ3/Îµ3 or APOE Îµ3/Îµ4 patients; this finding was reproduced in conditioned medium from mouse primary glial cell cultures with targeted replacement of apoE. Cerebrospinal fluid apoE-positive and Î²-amyloid (AÎ²42)-positive particle concentrations were persistently reduced one-third to one-half in middle and older age subjects; apoAI-positive particle concentration progressively increased approximately 2-fold with age. Both apoAI-positive and annexin V-positive CSF particle levels were reduced one-third to one-half in CSF of MCI and/or AD dementia patients versus age-matched controls. Our approach provides new methods to investigate CNS lipid biology in relation to neurodegeneration and perhaps develop new biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment monitoring.


Title #408: Hippocampal Sclerosis of Aging Can Be Segmental: Two Cases and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a neurodegenerative disease that mimics Alzheimer disease (AD) clinically and has a prevalence rivaling AD in advanced age. Whereas clinical biomarkers are not yet optimized, HS-Aging has distinctive pathological features that distinguish it from other diseases with "hippocampal sclerosis" pathology, such as epilepsy, cerebrovascular perturbations, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. By definition, HS-Aging brains show neuronal cell loss and gliosis in the hippocampal formation out of proportion to AD-type pathology; it is strongly associated with aberrant TDP-43 pathology and arteriolosclerosis. Here, we describe 2 cases of "segmental" HS-Aging in which "sclerosis" in the hippocampus was evident only in a subset of brain sections by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. In these cases, TDP-43 pathology was more widespread on immunostained sections than the neuronal cell loss and gliosis seen in H&E stains. The 2 patients were cognitively intact at baseline and were tracked longitudinally over a decade using cognitive studies with at least 1 neuroimaging scan. We discuss the relevant HS-Aging literature, which indicates the need for a clearer consensus-based delineation of "hippocampal sclerosis" and TDP-43 pathologies in aged subjects.

Title #411: Limited Health Knowledge as a Reason for Non-Use of Four Common Complementary Health Practices.
PMID: 26083564
Authors: Adam A. Burke, Richard L RL. Nahin, Barbara J BJ. Stussman
Abstract: Complementary health practices are an important element of health/healthcare seeking behavior among adults in the United States. Reasons for use include medical need, prevention and wellness promotion, and cultural relevance. Survey studies published over the past several decades have provided important information on the use of complementary health practices, such as acupuncture and yoga. A review of the literature, however, reveals an absence of studies looking specifically at who does not use these approaches, and why not.

Title #413: Analytical calculation of the lower bound on timing resolution for PET scintillation detectors comprising high-aspect-ratio crystal elements.
PMID: 26083559
Authors: Joshua W JW. Cates, Ruud R. Vinke, Craig S CS. Levin
Abstract: Excellent timing resolution is required to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain available from the incorporation of time-of-flight (ToF) information in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET). As the detector's timing resolution improves, so does SNR, reconstructed image quality, and accuracy. This directly impacts the challenging detection and quantification tasks in the clinic. The recognition of these benefits has spurred efforts within the molecular imaging community to determine to what extent the timing resolution of scintillation detectors can be improved and develop near-term solutions for advancing ToF-PET. Presented in this work, is a method for calculating the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on timing resolution for scintillation detectors with long crystal elements, where the influence of the variation in optical path length of scintillation light on achievable timing resolution is non-negligible. The presented formalism incorporates an accurate, analytical probability density function (PDF) of optical transit time within the crystal to obtain a purely mathematical expression of the CRLB with high-aspect-ratio (HAR) scintillation detectors. This approach enables the statistical limit on timing resolution performance to be analytically expressed for clinically-relevant PET scintillation detectors without requiring Monte Carlo simulation-generated photon transport time distributions. The analytically calculated optical transport PDF was compared with detailed light transport simulations, and excellent agreement was found between the two. The coincidence timing resolution (CTR) between two [Formula: see text] mm[Formula: see text] LYSO:Ce crystals coupled to analogue SiPMs was experimentally measured to be [Formula: see text] ps FWHM, approaching the analytically calculated lower bound within 6.5%.

Title #417: Pet Therapy in Correctional Institutions: A Perspective From Relational-Cultural Theory.
PMID: 26083555
Authors: Rita R. Thomas, Jonathan J. Matusitz
Abstract: In this article the authors apply Relational-Cultural Theory to pet therapy in correctional institutions. An important premise is that when pet therapy is used in prisons a symbiotic relationship develops between pets and prison inmates which, at the same time, improve their relationships with people themselves. Relational-Cultural Theory posits that relationships with individuals are not just a means to an end. Rather, good relationships promote growth and healthy development; they also cultivate reciprocal empathy. Hence, a major reason of suffering for most people is their experience of isolation; healing can occur in growth-fostering relationships.


Title #418: In situ Delivery of Tumour Antigen- and Adjuvant-Loaded Liposomes Boosts Antigen-Specific T Cell Responses by Human Dermal Dendritic Cells.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DC) play an important role in tumour control via the induction of tumour specific T cell responses and are therefore an ideal target for immunotherapy. The human skin is an attractive site for tumour vaccination as it contains various DC subsets. The simultaneous delivery of tumour antigen with an adjuvant is beneficial for cross-presentation and the induction of tumour-specific T cell responses. We therefore developed liposomes that contain the melanoma-associated antigen gp100280-288 peptide and TLR4 ligand MPLA as adjuvant. These liposomes are efficiently taken up by monocyte-derived DC and antigen presentation to CD8(+) T cells was significantly higher with MPLA-modified liposomes as compared to non-modified liposomes or the co-administration of soluble MPLA. We used a human skin explant model to evaluate the efficiency of intradermal delivery of liposomes. Liposomes were efficiently taken up by CD1a(+) and especially CD14(+) dermal DC. Induction of CD8(+) T cell responses by emigrated dermal DC was significantly higher when MPLA was incorporated into the liposomes as compared to non-modified liposomes or co-administration of soluble MPLA. Thus, the modification of antigen-carrying liposomes with TLR ligand MPLA significantly enhances tumour-specific T cell responses by dermal DC and is an attractive vaccination strategy in human skin.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 17 June 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.226.

Abstract: The era of targeted therapy has introduced a new therapeutic perspective for melanoma patients. Treatment with BRAF(V600) inhibitors has improved overall and disease-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAF(V600) mutations. Although the BRAF(V600E) mutation appears to play a critical role in tumor initiation, its expression during tumor progression remains controversial. In fact, various authors claim that BRAF(V600E) heterogeneity is evident in melanoma tumors. Herein, we investigated the pattern of BRAF(V600E) expression in matched primary and metastatic samples from 140 patients. Using a combination of real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses, we demonstrated that BRAF(V600E) expression is homogeneous in melanoma tumors and hypothesized that the heterogeneity described by others might be attributable to technical issues when molecular methods are used. We also demonstrated the high efficiency of the anti-BRAF(V600E) VE1 antibody for the detection of BRAF(V600E) mutations in melanoma tumors.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 17 June 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.229.


Title #420: Selective Photooxidation of a Mustard-Gas Simulant Catalyzed by a Porphyrinic Metal-Organic Framework.
PMID: 26083551
Authors: Yangyang Y. Liu, Ashlee J AJ. Howarth, Joseph T JT. Hupp, Omar K OK. Farha
Abstract: The photooxidation of a mustard-gas simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), is studied using a porphyrin-based metal-organic framework (MOF) catalyst. At room temperature and neutral pH value, singlet oxygen is generated by PCN-222/MOF-545 using an inexpensive and commercially available light-emitting diode. The singlet oxygen produced by PCN-222/MOF-545 selectively oxidizes CEES to the comparatively nontoxic product 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) without formation of the highly toxic sulfone product. In comparison to current methods, which utilize hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, this is a more realistic, convenient, and effective method for mustard-gas detoxification.


Title #421: Graphene/Pentacene Barristor with Ion-Gel Gate Dielectric: Flexible Ambipolar Transistor with High Mobility and On/Off Ratio.
PMID: 26083550

Abstract: High-quality channel layer is required for next-generation flexible electronic devices. Graphene is a good candidate due to its high carrier mobility and unique ambipolar transport characteristics but typically shows a low on/off ratio caused by gapless band structure. Popularly investigated organic semiconductors, such as pentacene, suffer from poor carrier mobility. Here we propose a graphene/pentacene channel layer with high-k ion-gel gate dielectric. The graphene/pentacene device shows both high on/off ratio and carrier mobility as well as excellent mechanical flexibility. Most importantly, it reveals ambipolar behaviors and related negative differential resistance, which are controlled by external bias. Therefore, our graphene/pentacene barristor with ion-gel gate dielectric can offer various flexible device applications with high performances.

Abstract: Cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) forming the BBB (blood-brain barrier) are at the interface of the immune and the central nervous systems and thus may play an important role in the functional integration of the two systems. Here we investigated how CECs recognize and respond to pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns in order to regulate the functions of the neurovascular unit. First we detected the expression of several NOD-like receptors (NLRs) - including NOD1, NOD2, NLRC4, NLRC5, NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP5, NLRP9, NLRP10, NLRP12, NLRA and NLRX - in human brain endothelial cells. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-1Î² had stimulatory effects on the transcription of many of these receptors. Expression of key inflammasome components (NOD2, NLRP3 and caspase-1) along with caspase-cleaved interleukins IL-1Î² and IL-33 could be induced by priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and activation with muramyl dipeptide (MDP). In addition, combined treatment with LPS and MDP resulted in IL-1Î² secretion in a caspase- and ERK1/2 kinase-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate that NLRs and inflammasomes can be activated in cerebral endothelial cells, which may confer an unexplored role to the BBB in neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory processes.

Title #426: Ammonia Binds to the Dangler Manganese of the Photosystem II Oxygen Evolving Complex.
PMID: 26083545
Authors: Paul H PH. Oyala, Troy A TA. Stich, Richard J RJ. Debus, R David RD. Britt
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray structures of Photosystem II reveal several potential sub- strate binding sites at the water-oxidizing/oxygen-evolving 4MnCa cluster. Aspartate- 61 of the D1 protein hydrogen bonds with one such water (W1), which is bound to the dangler Mn4A of the oxygen-evolving complex. Comparison of pulse EPR spectra of 14NH3 and 15NH3 bound to wild-type Synechocystis PSII and a D1-D61A mutant lacking this H-bonding interaction demonstrates that ammonia binds as a terminal NH3 at this dangler Mn4A site, and not as a partially deprotonated bridge between two metal centers. The implications of this finding on identifying the binding sites of the substrate and the subsequent mechanism of dioxygen formation are discussed.

Title #428: Assessing Nutritional Parameters of Brown Bear Diets among Ecosystems Gives Insight into Differences among Populations.
PMID: 26083536
Authors: Claudia C. LÃ³pez-Alfaro, Sean C P SC. Coogan, Charles T CT. Robbins, Jennifer K JK. Fortin, Scott E SE. Nielsen
Abstract: Food habit studies are among the first steps used to understand wildlife-habitat relationships. However, these studies are in themselves insufficient to understand differences in population productivity and life histories, because they do not provide a direct measure of the energetic value or nutritional composition of the complete diet. Here, we developed a dynamic model integrating food habits and nutritional information to assess nutritional parameters of brown bear (Ursus arctos) diets among three interior ecosystems of North America. Specifically, we estimate the average amount of digestible energy and protein (per kilogram fresh diet) content in the diet and across the active season by bears living in western Alberta, the Flathead River (FR) drainage of southeast British Columbia, and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). As well, we estimate the proportion of energy and protein in the diet contributed by different food items, thereby highlighting important food resources in each ecosystem. Bear diets in Alberta had the lowest levels of digestible protein and energy through all seasons, which might help explain the low reproductive rates of this population. The FR diet had protein levels similar to the recent male diet in the GYE during spring, but energy levels were lower during late summer and fall. Historic and recent diets in GYE had the most energy and protein, which is consistent with their larger body sizes and higher population productivity. However, a recent decrease in consumption of trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), whitebark pine nuts (Pinus albicaulis), and ungulates, particularly elk (Cervus elaphus), in GYE bears has decreased the energy and protein content of their diet. The patterns observed suggest that bear body size and population densities are influenced by seasonal availability of protein an energy, likely due in part to nutritional influences on mass gain and reproductive success.


Title #429: Diatoms and Other Epibionts Associated with Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) Sea Turtles from the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica.
PMID: 26083535
Authors: Roksana R. Majewska, Mario M. Santoro, Federico F. BolaÃ±os, Gerardo G. Chaves, Mario M. De Stefano
Abstract: Although the sea turtles have long been familiar and even iconic to marine biologists, many aspects of their ecology remain unaddressed. The present study is the first of the epizoic diatom community covering the olive ridley turtle's (Lepidochelys olivacea) carapace and the first describing diatoms living on sea turtles in general, with the primary objective of providing detailed information on turtle epibiotic associations. Samples of turtle carapace including the associated diatom biofilm and epizoic macro-fauna were collected from Ostional beach (9Â° 59Â´ 23.7Â´Â´ N 85Â° 41Â´ 52.6Â´Â´ W), Costa Rica, during the arribada event in October 2013. A complex diatom community was present in every sample. In total, 11 macro-faunal and 21 diatom taxa were recorded. Amongst diatoms, the most numerous were erect (Achnanthes spp., Tripterion spp.) and motile (Haslea sp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., Proschkinia sp.) forms, followed by adnate Amphora spp., while the most common macro-faunal species was Stomatolepas elegans (Cirripedia). Diatom densities ranged from 8179 Â± 750 to 27685 Â± 4885 cells mm-2. Epizoic microalgae were either partly immersed or entirely encapsulated within an exopolymeric coat. The relatively low diatom species number, stable species composition and low inter-sample dissimilarities (14.4% on average) may indicate a mutualistic relationship between the epibiont and the basibiont. Dispersal of sea turtle diatoms is probably highly restricted and similar studies will help to understand both diatom diversity, evolution and biogeography, and sea turtle ecology and foraging strategies.


Title #430: Nanoparticle Stabilized Capsules for the Treatment of Bacterial Biofilms.

Abstract: Bacterial biofilms are widely associated with persistent infections. High resistance to conventional antibiotics and prevalent virulence makes eliminating these bacterial communities challenging therapeutic targets. We describe here the fabrication of a nanoparticle-stabilized capsule with a multicomponent core for the treatment of biofilms. The peppermint oil and cinnamaldehyde combination that comprises the core of the capsules act as potent antimicrobial agents. An in situ reaction at the oil/water interface between the nanoparticles and cinnamaldehyde structurally augments the capsules to efficiently deliver the essential oil payloads, effectively eradicating biofilms of clinically isolated pathogenic bacteria strains. In contrast to their antimicrobial action, the capsules selectively promoted fibroblast proliferation in a mixed bacteria/mammalian cell system making them promising for wound healing applications.


Title #431: Validation of functional imaging as a biomarker for radiation treatment response.
PMID: 26083533
Authors: C. C. Jentsch, B. B. Beuthien-Baumann, E G C EG. Troost, G. G. Shakirin
Abstract: Major advances in radiotherapy techniques, increasing knowledge of tumour biology and the ability to translate these advances into new therapeutic approaches are important goals towards more individualized cancer treatment. With the development of non-invasive functional and molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scanning and MRI, there is now a need to evaluate potential new biomarkers for tumour response prediction, for treatment individualization is not only based on morphological criteria but also on biological tumour characteristics. The goal of individualization of radiotherapy is to improve treatment outcome and potentially reduce chronic treatment toxicity. This review gives an overview of the molecular and functional imaging modalities of tumour hypoxia and tumour cell metabolism, proliferation and perfusion as predictive biomarkers for radiation treatment response in head and neck tumours and in lung tumours. The current status of knowledge on integration of PET/CT/MRI into treatment management and bioimage-guided adaptive radiotherapy are discussed.


Title #432: Putative Effect of Aquifer Recharge on the Abundance and Taxonomic Composition of Endemic Microbial Communities.
PMID: 26083532
Authors: Renee J RJ. Smith, James S JS. Paterson, Cally A CA. Sibley, John L JL. Hutson, James G JG. Mitchell
Abstract: Drought events and the overexploitation of freshwater resources have led to the increased need to manage groundwater reserves. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), whereby artificial water is injected into aquifers for storage, is one of the proposed methods by which freshwater supplies can be increased. Microbial clogging following injection, however, is a major issue. Here, during laboratory simulations of ASR, we used flow cytometry and bar-coded pyrosequencing to investigate changes in microbial abundance and community dynamics. Bacterial abundance ranged from 5.0 Ã 104 to 1.4 Ã 107 cells ml-1 before the addition of synthetic wastewater. Following wastewater addition, a 25-fold decrease in abundance was observed, coinciding with a 12-fold increase in viral abundance. Taxa shifted from an overrepresentation of Sphingomonadales, Sphingobacteriales, Rhodospirillales, Caulobacterales, Legionellales, Bacillales, Fusobacteriales and Verrucomicrobiales prior to the addition of synthetic wastewater to Burkholderiales, Actinomycetales, Pseudomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Rhodobacterales, Thizobiales and Thiotrichales following the addition of synthetic wastewater. Furthermore, a significant difference in overall taxonomic composition between the groundwater samples before and after the addition of synthetic wastewater was observed, with water samples exhibiting more similarity to sediment samples after wastewater was added. Collectively, these results suggest that ASR may alter the taxonomic composition of endemic microbial communities and that complete profiles of groundwater properties, including microbial community abundance and composition need to be taken into consideration when selecting aquifers for ASR practices.


Title #433: Rhinacanthin C Inhibits Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Resorption: Roles of TRAF6/TAK1/MAPKs/NF-ÎºB/NFATc1 Signaling.
PMID: 26083531

Abstract: Rhinacanthin C is a naphthoquinone ester with anti-inflammatory activity, found in Rhinacanthus nasutus (L) Kurz (Acanthaceae). We found that rhinacanthin C inhibited osteoclast differentiation stimulated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) in mouse bone marrow macrophage cultures, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory mechanisms of rhinacanthin C in osteoclastogenesis. Rhinacanthin C suppressed RANKL-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) expression. Phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and NF-ÎºB, but not p38, was inhibited by rhinacanthin C, which also inhibited RANKL-stimulated TRAF6-TAK1 complex formation. Thus, the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of rhinacanthin C is mediated by a cascade of inhibition of RANKL-induced TRAF6-TAK1 association followed by activation of MAPKs/NF-ÎºB; this leads to suppression of c-Fos and NFATc1, which regulate transcription of genes associated with osteoclast differentiation. In vivo, rhinacanthin C also reduced RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption in mouse calvaria. Rhinacanthin C also suppressed LPS-stimulated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. Rhinacanthin C may provide a novel therapy for abnormal bone lysis that occurs during inflammatory bone resorption.


Title #434: Transient Rechargeable Batteries Triggered by Cascade Reactions.

Abstract: Transient battery is a new type of technology that allows the battery to disappear by an external trigger at any time. In this work, we successfully demonstrated the first transient rechargeable batteries based on dissoluble electrodes such as V2O5 as the cathode and lithium metal as the anode as well as a biodegradable separator and battery encasement (PVP and sodium alginate, respectively). All the components are robust in a traditional Lithium-ion Battery (LIB) organic electrolyte and disappear in water completely within minutes due to triggered cascade reactions. With a simple cut-and-stack method, we designed a fully transient device with an area of 0.5 cm by 1 cm and total energy of 0.1 joules. A shadow-mask technique was used to demonstrate the miniature device, which is compatible with transient electronics manufacturing. The materials, fabrication methods, and integration strategy discussed will be of interest for future developments in transient, self-powered electronics. The demonstration of a miniature Li battery shows the feasibility towards system integration for all transient electronics.


Title #435: Substantial Oxygen Flux in Dual-Phase Membrane of Ceria and Pure Electronic Conductor by Tailoring the Surface.
PMID: 26083529
Authors: Jong Hoon JH. Joo, Kyong Sik KS. Yun, Jung-Hwa JH. Kim, Younki Y. Lee, Chung-Yul CY. Yoo, Ji Haeng JH. Yu
Abstract: The oxygen permeation flux of dual-phase doped ceria membranes, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-Î´-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3Â±Î´ (GDC/LSM), has been systematically studied as a function of their LSM content, thickness, and coating material. The electronic percolation threshold of this GDC/LSM membrane occurs at about 20 vol% LSM. The coated LSM20 (80 vol% GDC, 20 vol% LSM) dual-phase membrane exhibits a maximum oxygen flux of 2.2 mLÂ·cm-2Â·min-1 at 850 Â°C, indicating that to enhance the oxygen permeation flux, the LSM content should be adjusted to the minimum value at which electronic percolation is maintained. The oxygen ion conductivity of the dual-phase membrane is reliably calculated from oxygen flux data by considering the effects of surface oxygen exchange. Thermal cycling tests confirm the mechanical stability of the membrane. Furthermore, a dual-phase membrane prepared here with a cobalt-free coating remains chemically stable in a CO2 atmosphere at a lower temperature (800 Â°C) than has previously been achieved.

Title #437: Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in Dystrophin-Deficient Muscle Cells: Effects on Regeneration Capacity, Inflammation Response and Oxidative Stress.
PMID: 26083527

Abstract: The present study evaluated low-level laser therapy (LLLT) effects on some physiological pathways that may lead to muscle damage or regeneration capacity in dystrophin-deficient muscle cells of mdx mice, the experimental model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Primary cultures of mdx skeletal muscle cells were irradiated only one time with laser and analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. The LLLT parameter used was 830 nm wavelengths at 5 J/cmÂ² fluence. The following groups were set up: Ctrl (untreated C57BL/10 primary muscle cells), mdx (untreated mdx primary muscle cells), mdx LA 24 (mdx primary muscle cells - LLLT irradiated and analyzed after 24 h), and mdx LA 48 (mdx primary muscle cells - LLLT irradiated and analyzed after 48 h). The mdx LA 24 and mdx LA 48 groups showed significant increase in cell proliferation, higher diameter in muscle cells and decreased MyoD levels compared to the mdx group. The mdx LA 48 group showed significant increase in Myosin Heavy Chain levels compared to the untreated mdx and mdx LA 24 groups. The mdx LA 24 and mdx LA 48 groups showed significant increase in [Ca2+]i. The mdx group showed significant increase in H2O2 production and 4-HNE levels compared to the Ctrl group and LLLT treatment reduced this increase. GSH levels and GPx, GR and SOD activities increased in the mdx group. Laser treatment reduced the GSH levels and GR and SOD activities in dystrophic muscle cells. The mdx group showed significant increase in the TNF-Î± and NF-ÎºB levels, which in turn was reduced by the LLLT treatment. Together, these results suggest that the laser treatment improved regenerative capacity and decreased inflammatory response and oxidative stress in dystrophic muscle cells, indicating that LLLT could be a helpful alternative therapy to be associated with other treatment for dystrophinopathies.


Title #438: Nonsteroidal antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor.
PMID: 26083526
Authors: Peter P. Kolkhof, Christina C. Nowack, Frank F. Eitner
Abstract: The broad clinical use of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is limited by the potential risk of inducing hyperkalemia when given on top of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Drug discovery campaigns have been launched aiming for the identification of nonsteroidal MRAs with an improved safety profile. This review analyses the evidence for the potential of improved safety profiles of nonsteroidal MRAs and the current landscape of clinical trials with nonsteroidal MRAs.


Title #439: The Effect of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Blockade Medications on Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography: A Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 26083525
Authors: Zhijun Z. Wu, Huan H. Zhang, Wei W. Jin, Yan Y. Liu, Lin L. Lu, Qiujing Q. Chen, Ruiyan R. Zhang
Abstract: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is the main complication of contrast media administration (CM) in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There are inconsistent results in the literature regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) on CIN. We evaluated the association between the administration of ACEI/ARBs and CIN, as well as the effect of ACEI/ARBs on post-procedural changes in renal function index, in patients undergoing CAG.

Abstract: Although childhood cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related deaths among children younger than 14 years of age, it is relatively rare. Each year, an average of 910 children are diagnosed with cancer in Canada, and 139 children die of the disease. Cancers in children differ biologically from those usually found in adults. The majority of cancers in adults are carcinomas of the epithelial tissues that line organs such as the breast, lung, colon and prostate. In children, carcinomas are rare and childhood tumours are more likely to be embryonic or hematopoietic in origin. Leukemias, lymphomas and central nervous system cancers represent the largest diagnostic groups. Compared to cancers in adults, cancers in children have shorter latency periods and are generally more aggressive, invasive and advanced at diagnosis. Despite the high ranking of cancer as a cause of death in children, survival rates have improved substantially over the last two decades so that more children survive cancer than ever before. However, over 60% of childhood cancer survivors face long-term physical and mental side-effects from the disease and its treatment, and nearly 30% have severe or life-threatening late effects. Survivors of childhood cancer have an 11-fold increased risk of death, an increased risk of second cancers up to 30 years after treatment and a wide variety of chronic physical, psychosocial and cognitive problems. The recognition of the unique nature of cancers in this age group and extensive long-term late effects has led many countries to establish specialized pediatric cancer surveillance and follow-up systems. In 2009, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) launched a pan-Canadian specialized childhood cancer surveillance system that actively follows children aged up to 14 years treated at one of the 17 pediatric oncology centres across the country. The Cancer in Young People in Canada (CYP-C) program is a renewal of the federal government's Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control program (CCCSCP). Established under the Brighter Futures Initiative in 1992, the program includes comprehensive data on a child's cancer diagnosis, treatments, outcomes and health care utilization. In this article, we describe the strengths and successes of CYP-C by highlighting rigour in data collection and quality control methodology as well as recent achievements and future directions.

Abstract: Inorganic arsenic and its metabolites are considered dangerous to human health. Although several studies have reported associations between low-level arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus in the United States and Mexico, this association has not been studied in the Canadian population. We evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by total arsenic concentration in urine, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 3151 adult participants in Cycle 1 (2007-2009) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS).


Title #443: A population-based cohort study of oral health in South Brazil: The Porto Alegre Study.

Abstract: Few population-based cohort studies have been established in Dentistry and this is especially true for Latin America. We conducted a population-based prospective study focusing on oral health in Porto Alegre, south Brazil, and herein we describe its methodology and discuss directions for further research. The cohort was established in 2001 using a multistage probability sample of 1,465 toothed and 121 edentulous subjects. A 5-year follow-up was performed in 2006 that included 755 individuals. The main aim of this study was to determine the pattern and risk factors for periodontal disease progression and tooth loss incidence. A full-mouth protocol was used including periodontal assessments at six sites per tooth. Primary outcomes were periodontal attachment loss and tooth loss. Oral mucosal lesions, dental plaque, gingivitis, supragingival calculus, probing depths, gingival recession, and dental caries were also assessed. This is the first population-based cohort study to focus on periodontal disease in Latin America. Findings will contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of periodontal disease and provide valuable data for the planning and implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Title #461: Antarctic moss stress assessment based on chlorophyll content and leaf density retrieved from imaging spectroscopy data.
PMID: 26083501
Authors: ZbynÄk Z. MalenovskÃ½, Johanna D JD. Turnbull, Arko A. Lucieer, Sharon A SA. Robinson
Abstract: The health of several East Antarctic moss-beds is declining as liquid water availability is reduced due to recent environmental changes. Consequently, a noninvasive and spatially explicit method is needed to assess the vigour of mosses spread throughout rocky Antarctic landscapes. Here, we explore the possibility of using near-distance imaging spectroscopy for spatial assessment of moss-bed health. Turf chlorophyll a and b, water content and leaf density were selected as quantitative stress indicators. Reflectance of three dominant Antarctic mosses Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Schistidium antarctici was measured during a drought-stress and recovery laboratory experiment and also with an imaging spectrometer outdoors on water-deficient (stressed) and well-watered (unstressed) moss test sites. The stress-indicating moss traits wereÂ derived from visible and near infrared turf reflectance using a nonlinear support vector regression. Laboratory estimates of chlorophyll content and leaf density were achieved with the lowest systematic/unsystematic root mean square errors of 38.0/235.2Â nmolÂ g(-1) DW and 0.8/1.6Â leavesÂ mm(-1) , respectively. Subsequent combination of these indicators retrieved from field hyperspectral images produced small-scale maps indicating relative moss vigour. Once applied and validated on remotely sensed airborne spectral images, this methodology could provide quantitative maps suitable for long-term monitoring of Antarctic moss-bed health.


Title #462: Control of Protein Activity and Cell Fate Specification via Light-Mediated Nuclear Translocation.
PMID: 26083500
Authors: Hayretin H. Yumerefendi, Daniel J DJ. Dickinson, Hui H. Wang, Seth P SP. Zimmerman, James E JE. Bear, Bob B. Goldstein, Klaus K. Hahn, Brian B. Kuhlman
Abstract: Light-activatable proteins allow precise spatial and temporal control of biological processes in living cells and animals. Several approaches have been developed for controlling protein localization with light, including the conditional inhibition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) with the Light Oxygen Voltage (AsLOV2) domain of phototropin 1 from Avena sativa. In the dark, the switch adopts a closed conformation that sterically blocks the NLS motif. Upon activation with blue light the C-terminus of the protein unfolds, freeing the NLS to direct the protein to the nucleus. A previous study showed that this approach can be used to control the localization and activity of proteins in mammalian tissue culture cells. Here, we extend this result by characterizing the binding properties of a LOV/NLS switch and demonstrating that it can be used to control gene transcription in yeast. Additionally, we show that the switch, referred to as LANS (light-activated nuclear shuttle), functions in the C. elegans embryo and allows for control of nuclear localization in individual cells. By inserting LANS into the C. elegans lin-1 locus using Cas9-triggered homologous recombination, we demonstrated control of cell fate via light-dependent manipulation of a native transcription factor. We conclude that LANS can be a valuable experimental method for spatial and temporal control of nuclear localization in vivo.

Title #465: Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis and Natural Conception: A Comparison of Live Birth Rates in Patients with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Associated with Translocation.
PMID: 26083495
Authors: Shinichiro S. Ikuma, Takeshi T. Sato, Mayumi M. Sugiura-Ogasawara, Motoi M. Nagayoshi, Atsushi A. Tanaka, Satoru S. Takeda
Abstract: Established causes of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) include antiphospholipid syndrome, uterine anomalies, parental chromosomal abnormalities, particularly translocations, and abnormal embryonic karyotypes. The number of centers performing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for patients with translocations has steadily increased worldwide. The live birth rate with PGD was reported to be 27-54%. The live birth rate with natural conception was reported to be 37-63% on the first trial and 65-83% cumulatively. To date, however, there has been no cohort study comparing age and the number of previous miscarriages in matched patients undergoing or not undergoing PGD. Thus, we compared the live birth rate of patients with RPL associated with a translocation undergoing PGD with that of patients who chose natural conception.


Title #466: Deciphering Signaling Pathway Networks to Understand the Molecular Mechanisms of Metformin Action.

Abstract: A drug exerts its effects typically through a signal transduction cascade, which is non-linear and involves intertwined networks of multiple signaling pathways. Construction of such a signaling pathway network (SPNetwork) can enable identification of novel drug targets and deep understanding of drug action. However, it is challenging to synopsize critical components of these interwoven pathways into one network. To tackle this issue, we developed a novel computational framework, the Drug-specific Signaling Pathway Network (DSPathNet). The DSPathNet amalgamates the prior drug knowledge and drug-induced gene expression via random walk algorithms. Using the drug metformin, we illustrated this framework and obtained one metformin-specific SPNetwork containing 477 nodes and 1,366 edges. To evaluate this network, we performed the gene set enrichment analysis using the disease genes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer, one T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset, three cancer GWAS datasets, and one GWAS dataset of cancer patients with T2D on metformin. The results showed that the metformin network was significantly enriched with disease genes for both T2D and cancer, and that the network also included genes that may be associated with metformin-associated cancer survival. Furthermore, from the metformin SPNetwork and common genes to T2D and cancer, we generated a subnetwork to highlight the molecule crosstalk between T2D and cancer. The follow-up network analyses and literature mining revealed that seven genes (CDKN1A, ESR1, MAX, MYC, PPARGC1A, SP1, and STK11) and one novel MYC-centered pathway with CDKN1A, SP1, and STK11 might play important roles in metformin's antidiabetic and anticancer effects. Some results are supported by previous studies. In summary, our study 1) develops a novel framework to construct drug-specific signal transduction networks; 2) provides insights into the molecular mode of metformin; 3) serves a model for exploring signaling pathways to facilitate understanding of drug action, disease pathogenesis, and identification of drug targets.

Title #469: ERCC1 and TS Expression as Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers in Metastatic Colon Cancer.
PMID: 26083491

Abstract: In patients with metastatic colon cancer, response to first line chemotherapy is a strong predictor of overall survival (OS). Currently, oncologists lack diagnostic tests to determine which chemotherapy regimen offers the greatest chance for response in an individual patient. Here we present the results of gene expression analysis for two genes, ERCC1 and TS, measured with the commercially available ResponseDX: Colon assay (Response Genetics, Los Angeles, CA) in 41 patients with de novo metastatic colon cancer diagnosed between July 2008 and August 2013 at the University of California, San Diego. In addition ERCC1 and TS expression levels as determined by RNAseq and survival data for patients in TCGA were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. We found that patients with low expression of ERCC1 (n = 33) had significantly longer median OS (36.0 vs. 10.1 mo, HR 0.29, 95% CI .095 to .84, log-rank p = 9.0x10-6) and median time to treatment to failure (TTF) following first line chemotherapy (14.1 vs. 2.4 mo, HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.048 to 0.58, log-rank p = 5.3x10-4) relative to those with high expression (n = 4). After accounting for the covariates age, sex, tumor grade and ECOG performance status in a Cox proportional hazard model the association of low ERCC1 with longer OS (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26, p = 0.0448) and TTF (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.21, p = 0.0053) remained significant. Patients with low TS expression (n = 29) had significantly longer median OS (36.0 vs. 14.8 mo, HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.074 to 0.82, log-rank p = 0.022) relative to those with high expression (n = 12). The combined low expression of ERCC1/TS was predictive of response in patients treated with FOLFOX (40% vs. 91%, RR 2.3, Fisher's exact test p = 0.03, n = 27), but not with FOLFIRI (71% vs. 71%, RR 1.0, Fisher's exact test p = 1, n = 14). Overall, these findings suggest that measurement of ERCC1 and TS expression has potential clinical utility in managing patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.


Title #470: Stress-Immune-Growth Interactions: Cortisol Modulates Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling and JAK/STAT Pathway in Rainbow Trout Liver.
PMID: 26083490
Authors: Anju M AM. Philip, Mathilakath M MM. Vijayan
Abstract: Chronic stress is a major factor in the poor growth and immune performance of salmonids in aquaculture. However, the molecular mechanisms linking stress effects to growth and immune dysfunction is poorly understood. The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), a family of genes involved in the inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway, negatively regulates growth hormone and cytokine signaling, but their role in fish is unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that cortisol modulation of SOCS gene expression is a key molecular mechanism leading to growth and immune suppression in response to stress in fish. Exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver slices to cortisol, mimicking stress level, upregulated SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 mRNA abundance and this response was abolished by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the presence of putative glucocorticoid response elements in rainbow trout SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 promoters. Prior cortisol treatment suppressed acute growth hormone (GH)-stimulated IGF-1 mRNA abundance in trout liver and this involved a reduction in STAT5 phosphorylation and lower total JAK2 protein expression. Prior cortisol treatment also suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 but not IL-8 transcript levels; the former but not the latter cytokine expression is via JAK/STAT phosphorylation. LPS treatment reduced GH signaling, but this was associated with the downregulation of GH receptors and not due to the upregulation of SOCS transcript levels by this endotoxin. Collectively, our results suggest that upregulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 transcript levels by cortisol, and the associated reduction in JAK/STAT signaling pathway, may be a novel mechanism leading to growth reduction and immune suppression during stress in trout.


Title #471: Genomic Comparison of Non-Typhoidal Salmonella enterica Serovars Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Hadar and Kentucky Isolates from Broiler Chickens.
PMID: 26083489
Authors: Akhilesh S AS. Dhanani, Glenn G. Block, Ken K. Dewar, Vincenzo V. Forgetta, Edward E. Topp, Robert G RG. Beiko, Moussa S MS. Diarra
Abstract: Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, associated with different foods including poultry products, are important causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. The colonization of the chicken gut by S. enterica could result in the contamination of the environment and food chain. The aim of this study was to compare the genomes of 25 S. enterica serovars isolated from broiler chicken farms to assess their intra- and inter-genetic variability, with a focus on virulence and antibiotic resistance characteristics.


Title #472: Multi-stimuli-responsive chiral organogels based on peptide derivatives.
PMID: 26083487
Authors: Chang-Wei CW. Liu, Ming M. Su, Xue-Liang XL. Li, Teng T. Xue, Na N. Liu, Jun J. Yin, Yuan-Yuan YY. Zhu, Zong-Quan ZQ. Wu
Abstract: A series of chiral aryl amide compounds bearing peptide pendants have been investigated as low molecular weight gelators. A mechanistic study reveals that complementary hydrogen bonding from peptide pendants is the main driving force for the formation of organogels. This new class of organogels can exhibit multi-stimuli-responsive behavior upon applying (1) thermal, (2) pH, (3) enantiomeric purity, and (4) fluoride anion stimuli. Enantiomeric purity as a new external stimulus displays sensitive stimuli-responsiveness; only 0.02 equiv. of the enantiomer can completely disassemble the gel aggregate. They will serve as excellent smart materials with potential applications in chiral sensors, recognition, and separation.


Title #473: A Peculiar New Pampatheriidae (Mammalia: Xenarthra: Cingulata) from the Pleistocene of Argentina and Comments on Pampatheriidae Diversity.
PMID: 26083486
Authors: FlÃ¡vio F. GÃ³is, Laureano RaÃºl LR. GonzÃ¡lez Ruiz, Gustavo Juan GJ. Scillato-YanÃ©, Esteban E. Soibelzon
Abstract: Pampatheriidae are a group of cingulates native to South American that are known from the middle Miocene to the lower Holocene. Two genera have been recognized between the lower Pleistocene and the lower Holocene: Pampatherium Gervais and Ameghino (Ensenadan, Bonaerian and Lujanian, lower Pleistocene-lower Holocene) and Holmesina Simpson (Blancan, Irvingtonian, upper Pliocene-lower Holocene). They have been mainly differentiated by their osteoderm morphology and cranio-dental characters. These taxa had a wide latitudinal distribution, extending from the southern part of South America (PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s, Argentina) to North America (Florida, USA). In this contribution, we describe a new genus and species of Pampatheriidae for the lower and middle Pleistocene of Buenos Aires Province and for the upper Pleistocene of Santa Fe Province (Argentina).The new taxon is represented by disarticulated osteoderms, one skull element, two thoracic vertebrae and a right femur and patella. It has extremely complex osteoderm ornamentations and particular morphological characters of the cranial element and femur that are not found in any other species of the family. This new taxon, recorded in the lower-middle Pleistocene (Ensenadan Stage/Age) and in the upper Pleistocene-early Holocene (Lujanian Stage/Age), is incorporated to the Pleistocene mammal assemblage of South America. Finally, the Pampatheriidae diversity is greater during the Lujanian Stage/Age than the Ensenadan Stage/Age.


Title #474: How to test the effect of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy?
PMID: 26083485

Abstract: Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is frequently used for the prevention of recurrent ischemic events. Various laboratory methods are used to detect the effect of these drugs administered in monotherapy, however their value in dual therapy has not been explored. Here, we determined which methods used for testing the effect of clopidogrel or aspirin are influenced by the other antiplatelet agent. One arm of the study included 53 ischemic stroke patients being on clopidogrel monotherapy showing effective inhibition of the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Laboratory tests routinely used for the detection of aspirin resistance (arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation/secretion, AA-induced thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production in platelet-rich plasma and VerifyNow Aspirin assay) were carried out on samples obtained from these patients. The other arm of the study involved 52 patients with coronary artery disease being on aspirin monotherapy. Methods used for testing the effect of clopidogrel (ADP-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, flow cytometric analysis of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation and a newly developed P2Y12-specific platelet aggregation (ADP[PGE1] test)) were performed on samples obtained from these patients. Clopidogrel monotherapy significantly inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, moreover, AA-induced TXB2 production was also significantly decreased. VASP phosphorylation and AA-induced platelet aggregation showed fair correlation in patients taking clopidogrel only. Clopidogrel did not inhibit the VerifyNow Aspirin test significantly. Aspirin monotherapy influenced ADP-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, but did not have an effect on VASP phosphorylation and on the ADP[PGE1] platelet aggregation test.


Title #475: Disproportionate Cochlear Length in Genus Homo Shows a High Phylogenetic Signal during Apes' Hearing Evolution.

Abstract: Changes in lifestyles and body weight affected mammal life-history evolution but little is known about how they shaped species' sensory systems. Since auditory sensitivity impacts communication tasks and environmental acoustic awareness, it may have represented a deciding factor during mammal evolution, including apes. Here, we statistically measure the influence of phylogeny and allometry on the variation of five cochlear morphological features associated with hearing capacities across 22 living and 5 fossil catarrhine species. We find high phylogenetic signals for absolute and relative cochlear length only. Comparisons between fossil cochleae and reconstructed ape ancestral morphotypes show that Australopithecus absolute and relative cochlear lengths are explicable by phylogeny and concordant with the hypothetized ((Pan,Homo),Gorilla) and (Pan,Homo) most recent common ancestors. Conversely, deviations of the Paranthropus oval window area from these most recent common ancestors are not explicable by phylogeny and body weight alone, but suggest instead rapid evolutionary changes (directional selection) of its hearing organ. Premodern (Homo erectus) and modern human cochleae set apart from living non-human catarrhines and australopiths. They show cochlear relative lengths and oval window areas larger than expected for their body mass, two features corresponding to increased low-frequency sensitivity more recent than 2 million years ago. The uniqueness of the "hypertrophied" cochlea in the genus Homo (as opposed to the australopiths) and the significantly high phylogenetic signal of this organ among apes indicate its usefulness to identify homologies and monophyletic groups in the hominid fossil record.

Title #478: Bilateral iliopsoas haemophilic "soft tissue pseudotumours": A case report.
PMID: 26083481
Authors: Achmad Fauzi AF. Kamal, Ananto Satya AS. Pradana, Yogi Y. Prabowo
Abstract: Haemophilic soft tissue pseudotumour is one of the rarest complications of haemophilia that caused by repetitive bleeding resulting in an encapsulated mass of clotted blood and necrotic tissue. Soft tissue pseudotumour may not only cause flexion contracture but also chronic pain and femoral nerve compression that cause severe disability. Thus, surgical excision is the treatment of choice. It should only be carried out in a major haemophilic center by an integrated multidisciplinary surgical team.

Authors: Bin B. Xia, Oladazimi O. Maysam, Sandra S. Veser, Lei L. Cao, Jie J. Li, Jie J. Jia, Hong H. Xie, Niels N. Birbaumer
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) movement control is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) research because being able to move, for example, a cursor with the brain will enable patients with motor disabilities to control their environment. However, it is still a challenge to continuously control 2D movement with a non-invasive BCI system. In this paper, we developed a 2D cursor control with motor imagery BCI tasks allowing users to move a cursor to any position by using a combination strategy. With this strategy, a user can combine multiple motor imagery tasks, alternatively or simultaneously, to control 2D movements.

Worland, Rama Krishna RK. Narla, Kimberly E KE. Fultz, Sabita S. Sankar
Abstract: We report here the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a novel series of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitors. A series of 4,6- or 1,7-disubstituted-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazine-2(1H)-ones were optimized for in vivo efficacy. These efforts resulted in the identification of compounds with excellent mTOR kinase inhibitory potency, with exquisite kinase selectivity over the related lipid kinase PI3K. The improved PK properties of this series allowed for exploration of in vivo efficacy and ultimately the selection of CC-223 for clinical development.


Title #482: Base-Displaced Intercalated Conformation of the 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline N(2)-dG DNA Adduct Positioned at the Nonreiterated G(1) in the NarI Restriction Site.
PMID: 26083477
Authors: Kallie M KM. Stavros, Edward K EK. Hawkins, Carmelo J CJ. Rizzo, Michael P MP. Stone
Abstract: The conformation of an N(2)-dG adduct arising from the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), a potent food mutagen, was determined in 5'-d(C(1)T(2)C(3)X(4)G(5)C(6)G(7)C(8)C(9)A(10)T(11)C(12))-3':5'-d(G(13)A(14)T(15)G(16)G(17)C(18)G(19)C(20)C(21)G(22)A(23)G(24))-3'; X = N(2)-dG-IQ, in which the modified nucleotide X(4) corresponds to G(1) in the 5'-d(G(1)G(2)CG(3)CC)-3' NarI restriction endonuclease site. Circular dichroism (CD) revealed blue shifts relative to the unmodified duplex, consistent with adduct-induced twisting, and a hypochromic effect for the IQ absorbance in the near UV region. NMR revealed that the N(2)-dG-IQ adduct adopted a base-displaced intercalated conformation in which the modified guanine remained in the anti conformation about the glycosidic bond, the IQ moiety intercalated into the duplex, and the complementary base C(21) was displaced into the major groove. The processing of the N(2)-dG-IQ lesion by hpol Î· is sequence-dependent; when placed at the reiterated G(3) position, but not at the G(1) position, this lesion exhibits a propensity for frameshift replication [Choi, J. Y., et al. (2006) J. Biol. Chem., 281, 25297-25306]. The structure of the N(2)-dG-IQ adduct at the nonreiterated G(1) position was compared to that of the same adduct placed at the G(3) position [Stavros, K. M., et al. (2014) Nucleic Acids Res., 42, 3450-3463]. CD indicted minimal spectral differences between the G(1) vs G(3) N(2)-dG-IQ adducts. NMR indicated that the N(2)-dG-IQ adduct exhibited similar base-displaced intercalated conformations at both the G(1) and G(3) positions. This result differed as compared to the corresponding C8-dG-IQ adducts placed at the same positions. The C8-dG-IQ adduct adopted a minor groove conformation when placed at position G(1) but a base-displaced intercalated conformation when placed at position G(3) in the NarI sequence. The present studies suggest that differences in lesion bypass by hpol Î· may be mediated by differences in the 3'-flanking sequences, perhaps modulating the ability to accommodate transient strand slippage intermediates.


Title #483: Analysis of the GGGGCC Repeat Expansions of the C9orf72 Gene in SCA3/MJD Patients from China.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders are a heterogeneous group of chronic progressive diseases and have pathological mechanisms in common. A certain causative gene identified for a particular disease may be found to play roles in more than one neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed the GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9orf72 gene in patients with SCA3/MJD from mainland China to determine whether the C9orf72 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD. In our study, there were no pathogenic repeats (>30 repeats) detected in either the patients or controls. SCA3/MJD patients with intermediate/intermediate or short/intermediate genotype (short: <7 repeats; intermediate: 7-30 repeats) of the GGGGCC repeats had an earlier onset compared with those with short/short genotype. The presence of the intermediate allele of the GGGGCC repeats in the patients decreased the age at onset by nearly 3 years. Our study firstly demonstrate that the development of SCA3/MJD may involve some physiological functions of the C9orf72 gene and provide new evidence to the hypothesis that a specific mutation identified in one of the neurodegenerative disorders may be a modulator in this class of diseases.


Title #484: Tuning the cavities of zirconium-based MIL-140 frameworks to modulate CO2 adsorption.
PMID: 26083475
Authors: Weibin W. Liang, Ravichandar R. Babarao, Tamara L TL. Church, Deanna M DM. D'Alessandro
Abstract: A combined experimental and computational study has revealed the interplay between the framework pore size and functionality on the CO2 adsorption performance of zirconium-based MIL-140 frameworks. The CO2-sorbent interactions were markedly influenced by pore-confinement effects which arise from the Ï-stacked arrangement of the ligands within the framework backbone.


Title #485: Effects of Vaccination with 10-Valent Pneumococcal Non-Typeable Haemophilus influenza Protein D Conjugate Vaccine (PHiD-CV) on the Nasopharyngeal Microbiome of Kenyan Toddlers.

Abstract: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce the prevalence of vaccine serotypes carried in the nasopharynx. Because this could alter carriage of other potential pathogens, we assessed the nasopharyngeal microbiome of children who had been vaccinated with 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV).


Title #486: Human Performance in a Realistic Instrument-Control Task during Short-Term Microgravity.
PMID: 26083473
Authors: Fabian F. Steinberg, Michael M. Kalicinski, Marc M. Dalecki, Otmar O. Bock
Abstract: Previous studies have documented the detrimental effects of microgravity on human sensorimotor skills. While that work dealt with simple, laboratory-type skills, we now evaluate the effects of microgravity on a complex, realistic instrument-control skill. Twelve participants controlled a simulated power plant during the short-term microgravity intervals of parabolic flight as well as during level flight. To this end they watched multiple displays, made strategic decisions and used multiple actuators to maximize their virtual earnings from the power plant. We quantified control efficiency as the participants' net earnings (revenue minus expenses), motor performance as hand kinematics and dynamics, and stress as cortisol level, self-assessed mood and self-assessed workload. We found that compared to normal gravity, control efficiency substantially decreased in microgravity, hand velocity slowed down, and cortisol level and perceived physical strain increased, but other stress and motor scores didn't change. Furthermore, control efficiency was not correlated with motor and stress scores. From this we conclude that realistic instrument control was degraded in short-term microgravity. This degradation can't be explained by the motor and/or stress indicators under study, and microgravity affected motor performance differently in our complex, realistic skill than in the simple, laboratory-type skills of earlier studies.

Title #488: Nucleophilic Functionalization of the Calix[6]arene Para- and Meta-Position via p-Bromodienone Route.
PMID: 26083470
Authors: Margherita M. De Rosa, Annunziata A. Soriente, Gerardo G. Concilio, Carmen C. Talotta, Carmine C. Gaeta, Placido P. Neri
Abstract: It is here demonstrated that the p-bromodienone route, previously reported for calix[4]arenes, is also effective for the functionalization of the calix[6]arene macrocycle. Thus, alcoholic O-nucleophiles can be introduced at the calix[6]arene exo rim. In addition, the reaction of a calix[6]arene p-bromodienone derivative with an actived aromatic substrate, such as resorcinol, led to the first example of a meta-functionalized, inherently chiral calix[6]arene derivative.


Title #489: Image-guided drug delivery: preclinical applications and clinical translation.
PMID: 26083469
Authors: Tarun T. Ojha, Larissa L. Rizzo, Gert G. Storm, Fabian F. Kiessling, Twan T. Lammers
Abstract: Image-guided drug delivery refers to the combination of drug targeting and imaging. Preclinically, image-guided drug delivery can be used for several different purposes, including for monitoring biodistribution, target site accumulation, off-target localization, drug release and drug efficacy. Clinically, it holds significant potential for preselecting patients. In this editorial, we briefly summarize the main principles of image-guided drug delivery, and we describe its potential for facilitating, furthering and personalizing nanomedicine treatments.

Abstract: Trichomonas vaginalis infection is associated with an increased risk of HIV infection in exposed-seronegative women (ESN) despite their unique immune quiescent profile. It is important to understand possible mechanisms, such as recruitment of activated T cells, by which T. vaginalis could facilitate HIV infection in this population.


Title #491: Independent Demographic Responses to Climate Change among Temperate and Tropical Milksnakes (Colubridae: Genus Lampropeltis).
PMID: 26083467
Authors: Sara S. Ruane, Omar O. Torres-Carvajal, Frank T FT. Burbrink
Abstract: The effects of Late Quaternary climate change have been examined for many temperate New World taxa, but the impact of Pleistocene glacial cycles on Neotropical taxa is less well understood, specifically with respect to changes in population demography. Here, we examine historical demographic trends for six species of milksnake with representatives in both the temperate and tropical Americas to determine if species share responses to climate change as a taxon or by area (i.e., temperate versus tropical environments). Using a multilocus dataset, we test for the demographic signature of population expansion and decline using non-genealogical summary statistics, as well as coalescent-based methods. In addition, we determine whether range sizes are correlated with effective population sizes for milksnakes. Results indicate that there are no identifiable trends with respect to demographic response based on location, and that species responded to changing climates independently, with tropical taxa showing greater instability. There is also no correlation between range size and effective population size, with the largest population size belonging to the species with the smallest geographic distribution. Our study highlights the importance of not generalizing the demographic histories of taxa by region and further illustrates that the New World tropics may not have been a stable refuge during the Pleistocene.


Title #492: Response of Methanogens in Arctic Sediments to Temperature and Methanogenic Substrate Availability.
PMID: 26083466

Abstract: Although cold environments are major contributors to global biogeochemical cycles, comparatively little is known about their microbial community function, structure, and limits of activity. In this study a microcosm based approach was used to investigate the effects of temperature, and methanogenic substrate amendment, (acetate, methanol and H2/CO2) on methanogen activity and methanogen community structure in high Arctic wetlands (Solvatnet and Stuphallet, Svalbard). Methane production was not detected in Stuphallet sediment microcosms (over a 150 day period) and occurred within Solvatnet sediments microcosms (within 24 hours) at temperatures from 5 to 40Â°C, the maximum temperature being at far higher than in situ maximum temperatures (which range from air temperatures of -1.4 to 14.1Â°C during summer months). Distinct responses were observed in the Solvatnet methanogen community under different short term incubation conditions. Specifically, different communities were selected at higher and lower temperatures. At lower temperatures (5Â°C) addition of exogenous substrates (acetate, methanol or H2/CO2) had no stimulatory effect on the rate of methanogenesis or on methanogen community structure. The community in these incubations was dominated by members of the Methanoregulaceae/WCHA2-08 family-level group, which were most similar to the psychrotolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanosphaerula palustris strain E1-9c. In contrast, at higher temperatures, substrate amendment enhanced methane production in H2/CO2 amended microcosms, and played a clear role in structuring methanogen communities. Specifically, at 30Â°C members of the Methanoregulaceae/WCHA2-08 predominated following incubation with H2/CO2, and Methanosarcinaceaeand Methanosaetaceae were enriched in response to acetate addition. These results may indicate that in transiently cold environments, methanogen communities can rapidly respond to moderate short term increases in temperature, but not necessarily to the seasonal release of previously frozen organic carbon from thawing permafrost soils. However, as temperatures increase such inputs of carbon will likely have a greater influence on methane production and methanogen community structure. Understanding the action and limitations of anaerobic microorganisms within cold environments may provide information which can be used in defining region-specific differences in the microbial processes; which ultimately control methane flux to the atmosphere.


Title #493: A highly selective, reversible inhibitor identified by comparative chemoproteomics modulates diacylglycerol lipase activity in neurons.

Cravatt, Mario M. van der Stelt
Abstract: Diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL)-Î± and -Î² are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Selective and reversible inhibitors are required to study the function of DAGLs in neuronal cells in an acute and temporal fashion, but they are currently lacking. Here, we describe the identification of a highly selective DAGL inhibitor using structure-guided and a chemoproteomics strategy to characterize the selectivity of the inhibitor in complex proteomes. Key to the success of this approach is the use of comparative and competitive activity-based proteome profiling (ABPP), in which broad-spectrum and tailor-made activity-based probes are combined to report on the inhibition of a protein family in its native environment. Competitive ABPP with broad-spectrum fluorophosphonate-based probes and specific Î²-lactone-based probes led to the discovery of Î±-ketoheterocycle LEI105 as a potent, highly selective and reversible dual DAGL-Î±/DAGL-Î² inhibitor. LEI105 did not affect other enzymes involved in endocannabinoid metabolism including abhydrolase domain-containing protein 6, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 12, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase and did not display affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Targeted lipidomics revealed that LEI105 concentration-dependently reduced 2-AG levels, but not anandamide levels, in Neuro2A cells. We show that cannabinoid CB1-receptor-mediated short-term synaptic plasticity in a mouse hippocampal slice model can be reduced by LEI105. Thus, we have developed a highly selective DAGL inhibitor and provide new pharmacological evidence to support the hypothesis that 'on demand biosynthesis' of 2-AG is responsible for retrograde signaling.

Title #496: Relationship between Cornea and Lid Margin Position on the Appearance of Strabismus.
PMID: 26083461
Authors: Dong Hyun DH. Wang, Jee Ho JH. Chang
Abstract: Previous strabismus appearance studies using images from real face photographs could not preclude the effect of other facial landmarks, such as position and contour of brow, nose, and facial outline, from pure effect of ocular deviation itself. With conceptualized drawings of eyes, we simulated strabismus deviation and collected the responses of observers.


Title #497: Staging of cervical cancer based on tumor heterogeneity characterized by texture features on (18)F-FDG PET images.
PMID: 26083460
Authors: Wei W. Mu, Zhe Z. Chen, Ying Y. Liang, Wei W. Shen, Feng F. Yang, Ruwei R. Dai, Ning N. Wu, Jie J. Tian
Abstract: The aim of the study is to assess the staging value of the tumor heterogeneity characterized by texture features and other commonly used semi-quantitative indices extracted from (18)F-FDG PET images of cervical cancer (CC) patients. Forty-two patients suffering CC at different stages were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we proposed a new tumor segmentation method by combining the intensity and gradient field information in a level set framework. Secondly, fifty-four 3D texture features were studied besides of SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Through correlation analysis, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, some independent indices showed statistically significant differences between the early stage (ES, stages I and II) and the advanced stage (AS, stages III and IV). Then the tumors represented by those independent indices could be automatically classified into ES and AS, and the most discriminative feature could be chosen. Finally, the robustness of the optimal index with respect to sampling schemes and the quality of the PET images were validated. Using the proposed segmentation method, the dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance were 91.78âââÂ±âââ1.66% and 7.94âââÂ±âââ1.99âmm, respectively. According to the correlation analysis, all the fifty-eight indices could be divided into 20 groups. Six independent indices were selected for their highest areas under the ROC curves (AUROC), and showed significant differences between ES and AS (Pââ<ââ0.05). Through automatic classification with the support vector machine (SVM) Classifier, run percentage (RP) was the most discriminative index with the higher accuracy (88.10%) and larger AUROC (0.88). The Pearson correlation of RP under different sampling schemes is 0.9991âââÂ±âââ0.0011. RP is a highly stable feature and well correlated with tumor stage in CC, which suggests it could differentiate ES and AS with high accuracy.


Title #498: PCVs in individuals at increased risk of pneumococcal disease: a literature review.
PMID: 26083459
Authors: Mark A MA. Fletcher, Paul P. Balmer, Eric E. Bonnet, Nathalie N. Dartois
Abstract: The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in childhood pneumococcal immunization programs successfully reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease in children. Nonetheless, there remains a high burden of pneumococcal disease in adults, especially the elderly, and children/adults with chronic medical conditions. Two pneumococcal vaccines are currently available for adults at risk of pneumococcal disease: the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and the more recently licensed PCV13. As it is not possible to determine vaccine efficacy in all populations at risk of pneumococcal disease, immunogenicity studies, measuring pneumococcal-specific antibody concentrations and/or the opsonophagocytic activity of serum can provide valuable comparative data for PPV and PCV immunization. This article provides consolidated data on the immunogenicity of PCVs (largely PCV7, and a few studies with PCV9 or PCV13) based on a review of immunogenicity/safety studies in populations (mainly pediatric) at increased risk of pneumococcal disease.

Title #500: Small-Molecule-Mediated Degradation of the Androgen Receptor Through Hydrophobic Tagging.

Abstract: Androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription is a major driver of prostate tumor cell proliferation. Consequently, it is the target of several antitumor chemotherapeutic agents, including the AR antagonist MDV3100/enzalutamide. Recent studies have shown that a single AR mutation (F876L) converts MDV3100 action from an antagonist to an agonist. Here we describe the generation of a novel class of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) to address this resistance mechanism. Molecules containing hydrophobic degrons linked to small-molecule AR ligands induce AR degradation, reduce expression of AR target genes and inhibit proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. These results suggest that selective AR degradation may be an effective therapeutic prostate tumor strategy in the context of AR mutations that confer resistance to second-generation AR antagonists.


Title #501: Closing Yield Gaps: How Sustainable Can We Be?
PMID: 26083456
Authors: Prajal P. Pradhan, GÃ¼nther G. Fischer, Harrij H. van Velthuizen, Dominik E DE. Reusser, Juergen P JP. Kropp
Abstract: Global food production needs to be increased by 60-110% between 2005 and 2050 to meet growing food and feed demand. Intensification and/or expansion of agriculture are the two main options available to meet the growing crop demands. Land conversion to expand cultivated land increases GHG emissions and impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services. Closing yield gaps to attain potential yields may be a viable option to increase the global crop production. Traditional methods of agricultural intensification often have negative externalities. Therefore, there is a need to explore location-specific methods of sustainable agricultural intensification. We identified regions where the achievement of potential crop calorie production on currently cultivated land will meet the present and future food demand based on scenario analyses considering population growth and changes in dietary habits. By closing yield gaps in the current irrigated and rain-fed cultivated land, about 24% and 80% more crop calories can respectively be produced compared to 2000. Most countries will reach food self-sufficiency or improve their current food self-sufficiency levels if potential crop production levels are achieved. As a novel approach, we defined specific input and agricultural management strategies required to achieve the potential production by overcoming biophysical and socioeconomic constraints causing yield gaps. The management strategies include: fertilizers, pesticides, advanced soil management, land improvement, management strategies coping with weather induced yield variability, and improving market accessibility. Finally, we estimated the required fertilizers (N, P2O5, and K2O) to attain the potential yields. Globally, N-fertilizer application needs to increase by 45-73%, P2O5-fertilizer by 22-46%, and K2O-fertilizer by 2-3 times compared to the year 2010 to attain potential crop production. The sustainability of such agricultural intensification largely depends on the way management strategies for closing yield gaps are chosen and implemented.


Title #502: A novel form of ficin from Ficus carica latex: Purification and characterization.
PMID: 26083455
Authors: Danielle D. Baeyens-Volant, AndrÃ© A. Matagne, Rachida R. El Mahyaoui, Ruddy R. Wattiez, Mohamed M. Azarkan
Abstract: A novel ficin form, named ficin E, was purified from fig tree latex by a combination of cation-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, Thiopropyl Sepharose 4B and fplc-gel filtration chromatography. The new ficin appeared not to be sensitive to thiol derivatization by a polyethylene glycol derivative, allowing its purification. The protease is homogeneous according to PAGE, SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, N-terminal micro-sequencing analyses and E-64 active site titration. N-terminal sequencing of the first ten residues has shown high identity with the other known ficin (iso)forms. The molecular weight was found to be (24,294Â±10)Da by mass spectrometry, a lower value than the apparent molecular weight observed on SDS-PAGE, around 27kDa. Far-UV CD data revealed a secondary structure content of 22% Î±-helix and 26% Î²-sheet. The protein is not glycosylated as shown by carbohydrate analysis. pH and temperature measurements indicated maxima activity at pH 6.0 and 50Â°C, respectively. Preliminary pH stability analyses have shown that the protease conserved its compact structure in slightly acidic, neutral and alkaline media but at acidic pH (<3), the formation of some relaxed or molten state was evidenced by 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid binding characteristics. Comparison with the known ficins A, B, C, D1 and D2 (iso)forms revealed that ficin E showed activity profile that looked like ficin A against two chromogenic substrates while it resembled ficins D1 and D2 against three fluorogenic substrates. Enzymatic activity of ficin E was not affected by Mg(2+), Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) at a concentration up to 10mM. However, the activity was completely suppressed by Zn(2+) at a concentration of 1mM. Inhibitory activity measurements clearly identified the enzyme as a cysteine protease, being unaffected by synthetic (Pefabloc SC, benzamidine) and by natural proteinaceous (aprotinin) serine proteases inhibitors, by aspartic proteases inhibitors (pepstatin A) and by metallo-proteases inhibitors (EDTA, EGTA). Surprisingly, it was well affected by the metallo-protease inhibitor o-phenanthroline. The enzymatic activity was however completely blocked by cysteine proteases inhibitors (E-64, iodoacetamide), by thiol-blocking compounds (HgCl2) and by cysteine/serine proteases inhibitors (TLCK and TPCK). This is a novel ficin form according to peptide mass fingerprint analysis, specific amidase activity, SDS-PAGE and PAGE electrophoretic mobility, N-terminal sequencing and unproneness to thiol pegylation.


Title #503: Prevalence and specificity of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases in fungi.
PMID: 26083454
Authors: Lorena L. Butinar, Martina M. MohorÄiÄ, ValÃ©rie V. Deyris, Katia K. Duquesne, Gilles G. Iacazio, Magalie M. Claeys-Bruno, Josepha J. Friedrich, VÃ©ronique V. Alphand
Abstract: Out of 107 fungal strains belonging to three phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota) and 46 genera, 86 exhibited Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) activity against racemic bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenone. The strains were classified into three "profiles" based on regio- and enantioselectivity. Statistical analyses of our results, extended by literature data, showed that these profiles could be related to the taxonomic classification of the strains, and suggest that the BVMOs from the Zygomycota phylum may be different in their primary structures from established ones.


Title #504: Chemical constituents of Abies fabri.

Abstract: Systematic phytochemical investigations on Abies fabri resulted in the isolation of 94 compounds, consisting of 68 terpenoids, six lignans, seven flavonoids, and 13 other miscellaneous chemical constituents. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods, and the absolute configurations of three of these previously unknown compounds were determined by Cu-KÎ± X-ray crystallographic analysis. Twelve previously unreported compounds, one artifact, and one potential artifact were identified, including six triterpenoids, four diterpenoids, two sesquiterpenoids, one lignan, and one phenol. 23-Hydroxy-3-oxolanosta-8,24-dien-26,23-olide showed weak cytotoxic activity against A549 and THP-1 cells with the IC50 values of 5.3 and 5.1Î¼M, respectively.


Title #505: Building Agency Capacity for Trauma-Informed Evidence-Based Practice and Field Instruction.
PMID: 26083452
Authors: Virginia V. Strand, Marciana M. Popescu, Robert R. Abramovitz, Sean S. Richards
Abstract: Through this article the authors describe how schools of social work offering a child and adolescent trauma specialization actively partnered with their community-based field placement agencies to achieve a dual purpose: help agencies sustain the capacity for evidence-based trauma treatment (EBTT) and provide sufficient EBTT MSW student field placement sites that support preparation of trauma-informed practitioners by schools of social work. Development and description of the specific conceptual framework used to inform the trauma-informed organizational change initiative is described. Results of an Organizational Readiness assessment undertaken at six agencies reflect a strong alignment between implementation drivers identified in the literature (Fixsen, Blase, Naoom, & Wallace, 2009) and the conceptual framework. The manner in which these results are being used by schools of social work and their agency partners in sustaining the implementation of evidence-based trauma treatment is reviewed, and implications for future research, education, and practice is discussed.


Title #506: Phase Coexistence in a Dynamic Phase Diagram.
PMID: 26083451
Authors: Luigi L. Gentile, Luigi L. Coppola, Sandor S. Balog, Kell K. Mortensen, Giuseppe A GA. Ranieri, Ulf U. Olsson
Abstract: Metastability and phase coexistence are important concepts in colloidal science. Typically, the phase diagram of colloidal systems is considered at the equilibrium without the presence of an external field. However, several studies have reported phase transition under mechanical deformation. The reason behind phase coexistence under shear flow is not fully understood. Here, multilamellar vesicle (MLV)-to-sponge (L3 ) and MLV-to-LÎ± transitions upon increasing temperature are detected using flow small-angle neutron scattering techniques. Coexistence of LÎ± and MLV phases at 40âÂ°C under shear flow is detected by using flow NMR spectroscopy. The unusual rheological behavior observed by studying the lamellar phase of a non-ionic surfactant is explained using (2) H NMR and diffusion flow NMR spectroscopy with the coexistence of planar lamellar-multilamellar vesicles. Moreover, a dynamic phase diagram over a wide range of temperatures is proposed.


Title #507: High Performance Graphene Nano-ribbon Thermoelectric Devices by Incorporation and Dimensional Tuning of Nanopores.
PMID: 26083450
Authors: Md M. Sharafat Hossain, Feras F. Al-Dirini, Faruque M FM. Hossain, Efstratios E. Skafidas
Abstract: Thermoelectric properties of Graphene nano-ribbons (GNRs) with nanopores (NPs) are explored for a range of pore dimensions in order to achieve a high performance two-dimensional nano-scale thermoelectric device. We reduce thermal conductivity of GNRs by introducing pores in them in order to enhance their thermoelectric performance. The electrical properties (Seebeck coefficient and conductivity) of the device usually degrade with pore inclusion; however, we tune the pore to its optimal dimension in order to minimize this degradation, enhancing the overall thermoelectric performance (high ZT value) of our device. We observe that the side channel width plays an important role to achieve optimal performance while the effect of pore length is less pronounced. This result is consistent with the fact that electronic conduction in GNRs is dominated along its edges. Ballistic transport regime is assumed and a semi-empirical method using Huckel basis set is used to obtain the electrical properties, while the phononic system is characterized by Tersoff empirical potential model. The proposed device structure has potential applications as a nanoscale local cooler and as a thermoelectric power generator.


Title #508: Novel Kidins220/ARMS Splice Isoforms: Potential Specific Regulators of Neuronal and Cardiovascular Development.
PMID: 26083449

Abstract: Kidins220/ARMS is a transmembrane protein playing a crucial role in neuronal and cardiovascular development. Kidins220/ARMS is a downstream target of neurotrophin receptors and interacts with several signalling and trafficking factors. Through computational modelling, we found two potential sites for alternative splicing of Kidins220/ARMS. The first is located between exon 24 and exon 29, while the second site replaces exon 32 by a short alternative terminal exon 33. Here we describe the conserved occurrence of several Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms at RNA and protein levels. Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms display spatio-temporal regulation during development with distinct patterns in different neuronal populations. Neurotrophin receptor stimulation in cortical and hippocampal neurons and neuroendocrine cells induces specific Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms and alters the appearance kinetics of the full-length transcript. Remarkably, alternative terminal exon splicing generates Kidins220/ARMS variants with distinct cellular localisation: Kidins220/ARMS containing exon 32 is targeted to the plasma membrane and neurite tips, whereas Kidins220/ARMS without exon 33 mainly clusters the full-length protein in a perinuclear intracellular compartment in PC12 cells and primary neurons, leading to a change in neurotrophin receptor expression. Overall, this study demonstrates the existence of novel Kidins220/ARMS splice isoforms with unique properties, revealing additional complexity in the functional regulation of neurotrophin receptors, and potentially other signalling pathways involved in neuronal and cardiovascular development.


Title #509: Coupling mitogenesis and mitophagy for longevity.
PMID: 26083448
Authors: Konstantinos K. Palikaras, Eirini E. Lionaki, Nektarios N. Tavernarakis
Abstract: Maintenance of mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis requires both generation of newly synthesized and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria. Impaired mitochondrial function and excessive mitochondrial content are major characteristics of ageing and several human pathophysiological conditions, highlighting the pivotal role of the coordination between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial mass homeostasis remain obscure. In our recent study, we demonstrate that DCT-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of mammalian BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX, is a key mediator of mitophagy promoting longevity under stress. DCT-1 acts downstream of the PINK-1-PDR-1/Parkin pathway and is ubiquitinated upon mitophagy-inducing conditions to mediate the removal of damaged mitochondria. Accumulation of damaged mitochondria triggers SKN-1 activation, which initiates a bipartite retrograde signaling pathway stimulating the coordinated induction of both mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy genes. Taken together, our results unravel a homeostatic feedback loop that allows cells to adjust their mitochondrial population in response to environmental and intracellular cues. Age-dependent decline of mitophagy both inhibits removal of dysfunctional or superfluous mitochondria and impairs mitochondrial biogenesis resulting in progressive mitochondrial accretion and consequently, deterioration of cell function.

Abstract: Fusarium oxysporum causes wilt disease in many plant families, and many genes are involved in its development or growth in host plants. A recent study revealed that vacuolar amino acid transporters play an important role in spore formation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To investigate the role of vacuolar amino acid transporters of this phytopathogenic fungus, the FOXG_11334 (FoAVT3) gene from F. oxysporum was isolated and its function was characterized. Transcription of FoAVT3 was upregulated after rapamycin treatment. A green fluorescent protein fusion of FoAvt3p was localized to vacuolar membranes in both S. cerevisiae and F. oxysporum. Analysis of the amino acid content of the vacuolar fraction and amino acid transport activities using vacuolar membrane vesicles from S. cerevisiae cells heterologously expressing FoAVT3 revealed that FoAvt3p functions as a vacuolar amino acid transporter, exporting neutral amino acids. We conclude that the FoAVT3 gene encodes a vacuolar neutral amino acid transporter.

Abstract: Cell surface display using the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris has been extensively developed for application in bioindustrial processes. Due to the rigid structure of their cell walls, a number of proteins have been successfully displayed on their cell surfaces. It was previously reported that the viral binding protein Rab7 from the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (PmRab7) and its binding partner envelope protein VP28 of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) could independently protect shrimp against WSSV infection. Thus, we aimed to display these two proteins independently on the cell surfaces of 2 yeast clones with the ultimate goal of using a mixture of the two clones as an orally deliverable, antiviral agent to protect shrimp against WSSV infection. PmRab7 and VP28 were modified by N-terminal tagging to the C-terminal half of S. cerevisiae Î±-agglutinin. DNA fragments, harboring fused-gene expression cassettes under control of an alcohol oxidase I (AOX1) promoter were constructed and used to transform the yeast cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies specific to both proteins demonstrated that mutated PmRab7 (mPmRab7) and partial VP28 (pVP28) were localized on the cell surfaces of the respective clones, and fluorescence intensity for each was significantly higher than that of control cells by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using cells displaying mPmRab7 or pVP28 revealed that the binding of specific antibodies for each was dose-dependent, and could be saturated. In addition, the binding of mPmRab7-expressing cells with free VP28, and vice versa was dose dependent. Binding between the two surface-expressed proteins was confirmed by an assay showing agglutination between cells expressing complementary mPmRab7 and pVP28. In summary, our genetically engineered P. pastoris can display biologically active mPmRab7 and pVP28 and is now ready for evaluation of efficacy in protecting shrimp against WSSV by oral administration.


Title #512: Malignant Hypertension and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: False Friends.
PMID: 26083445
Authors: Hossam H. Abdalla, Mostafa M. Alfishawy, Michael M. Babigumira, Tayyaba T. Bashir
Abstract: BACKGROUND Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare hematologic disorder resulting in hemolysis of red blood cells, consumption of platelets, and occlusion of microvasculature. Malignant hypertension is the clinical syndrome of severe elevations in blood pressure and funduscopic hypertensive retinopathy, including bilateral flame-shaped hemorrhage and papilledema. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with features of TTP and malignant hypertension treated with plasma exchange and developing end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSIONS Given the diagnostic uncertainty at presentation, clinicians should quickly intervene to control hypertension and institute plasma exchange as needed.


Title #513: Congenital Paraesophageal Hernia in a Cat.
PMID: 26083444
Authors: Kim K. Tong, Reunan R. Guillou, Doc D. VÃ©t
Abstract: A 3 mo old male domestic shorthair weighing 2 kg was presented for acute onset of anorexia, lethargy, paradoxical breathing, and a palpable mass effect in the cranial abdomen. Initial diagnostics and imaging suggested a pleuroperitoneal or hiatal hernia. Emergency abdominal exploration was performed, and a complex type II paraesophageal hiatal hernia was identified. The entire stomach, greater and lesser omenta, spleen, left limb of the pancreas, and the proximal segment of the descending duodenum were herniated through a discrete defect in the phrenicoesophageal ligament. After reduction of the herniated organs back into the abdomen, a phrenicoplasty, esophagopexy, and left-sided fundic gastropexy were performed. The cat recovered uneventfully from the procedure and was free of any signs of disease for at least 30 mo postoperatively. This is the first detailed report of the findings and successful surgical treatment of a complex congenital, type II paraesophageal hiatal hernia with complete herniation of the stomach, omenta, and spleen in a cat.


Title #514: Outcome and Prognostic Indicators in Cats Undergoing Splenectomy for Splenic Mast Cell Tumors.
PMID: 26083443
Authors: Kelly A KA. Kraus, Craig A CA. Clifford, Garrett J GJ. Davis, Kristina M KM. Kiefer, Kenneth J KJ. Drobatz
Abstract: This was a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating the outcome and clinical parameters associated with the postoperative prognosis of 36 cats with splenic mast cell tumors treated with splenectomy. Clinical parameters reviewed included signalment, clinical history, results of staging tests, surgical variables, administration of blood products, presence of metastasis, postoperative complications, administration of chemotherapy postoperatively, chemotherapy protocol, and response to chemotherapy. Overall median survival time was 390 days (range, 2-1737 days). Administration of a blood product (P < .0001), metastasis to a regional lymph node (P = .022), and evidence of either concurrent or historical neoplasia (P = .037) were negatively associated with survival. Response to chemotherapy (P = .0008) was associated with an improved median survival time. Larger-scale prospective studies evaluating different chemotherapy protocols are required to elucidate the discrepancy between lack of survival benefit with administration of chemotherapy and improvement in survival time with positive response to chemotherapy.


Title #515: Distribution, Complications, and Outcome of Footpad Injuries in Pet and Military Working Dogs.
PMID: 26083442
Authors: Lane A LA. Hansen, Kurt M KM. Hazenfield, Francisco F. Olea-Popelka, Dan D DD. Smeak
Abstract: This study reports the findings of 120 traumatic pad injuries in pet and military dogs. Most dogs (68%) presented with a laceration to a thoracic limb footpad, and one-third of dogs were middle-aged castrated males. Metacarpal pads were most commonly injured. Short-term complications were noted in 27% of dogs. No long-term complications were identified. No disability from pad injury was present at the completion of healing. Concurrent injuries to adjacent structures were uncommon and did not affect outcome. Dogs with full-thickness pad lacerations were at greater risk for major short-term complications compared to dogs with partial-thickness pad lacerations (odds ratio, 7.27; P = .001). Military working dogs with full-thickness pad lacerations were at greater risk for major short-term complications than pet dogs with a similar injury. When major complications developed in dogs with full-thickness pad injuries, time to final healing was significantly longer (by a median of 12 days). The partial-thickness pad lesions healed uneventfully regardless of whether they were bandaged, surgically repaired, or left to heal by second intention. Suture repair and bandaging of full-thickness lesions could not be shown to either decrease the risk for complications or improve healing. Future work should focus on establishing standards for footpad treatment to reduce complications.


Title #516: Bilateral Ovotestes in a 78, XX SRY-Negative Beagle Dog.

Abstract: This report describes a disorder of the sexual development in a beagle dog resulting in an intersex condition. A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-Î²-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism.


Title #517: Methylmalonic Aciduria Secondary to Selective Cobalamin Malabsorption in a Yorkshire Terrier.
PMID: 26083440
Authors: Gerard G. McLauchlan, Angela A. McLaughlin, Adrian C AC. Sewell, Rory R. Bell
Abstract: An 8 wk old male Yorkshire terrier was presented with a 2 wk history of recurrent hypoglycemia, lethargy, and seizures. Investigations revealed a marked increase in blood ammonia, low serum cobalamin, and increased levels of urinary methylmalonic acid (MMA) excretion. No liver vascular abnormality was detected. The patient was diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin malabsorption. The patient responded well to parenteral cobalamin administration, and the urinary MMA levels normalized rapidly following instigation of treatment. Due to the suspected hereditary nature of selective cobalamin deficiency, one sibling of this dog was screened and found to be normal. This is the first reported case of MMA secondary to hypocobalaminemia in Yorkshire terriers, and the second report of this disease in a dog in the United Kingdom. Given the fact that clinical signs of MMA are similar to those seen in dogs with portosystemic shunts and that Yorkshire terriers are predisposed to liver vascular abnormalities, this case report adds important clinical information to the current available literature.


Title #518: Sternal Cleft Associated with Cantrell's Pentalogy in a German Shepherd Dog.
PMID: 26083439
Authors: Manuel M. Benlloch-Gonzalez, Cyrill C. Poncet
Abstract: A 5 mo old male German shepherd dog weighing 15.5 kg was presented with an abdominal wall hernia and exercise intolerance. Physical examination showed a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur and an area of cutaneous atrophy overlying a midline supraumbilical wall defect. Thoracic radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasound examination revealed a congenital caudal sternal cleft, a supraumbilical diastasis rectus, and a patent ductus arteriosus. Exploratory surgery confirmed defects of the pars sternalis of the diaphragm and caudoventral pericardium and a persistent left cranial vena cava. Those findings were compatible with Cantrell's pentalogy. Surgical treatment included ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus through the sternal cleft, diaphragmatic reconstruction with paracostal extension of the diaphragmatic defect, pericardial and linea alba appositional reconstruction, and primary approximation of the sternal halves. Growth and exercise activity were normal 10 mo after surgery. The discovery of a midline cranial abdominal wall, pericardial, diaphragmatic, or sternal defect should prompt a thorough examination to rule out any possible associated syndrome. Cantrell's pentalogy presents various degrees of expression and is rare in dogs. Management involves early surgical repair of congenital anomalies to protect the visceral structures. The prognosis in dogs with mild forms of the syndrome is encouraging.


Title #519: Urothorax Associated with Uroperitoneum in a Dog Without Diaphragmatic Disruption.
PMID: 26083438
Authors: Paraskevi P PP. Tsompanidou, Tilemahos L TL. Anagnostou, George M GM. Kazakos, Lysimachos G LG. Papazoglou, Eugenia S ES. Flouraki, Michail N MN. Patsikas
Abstract: Accumulation of urine in the pleural space secondary to uroperitoneum with no disruption of the diaphragm appears to be a rare pathological condition. A 2 yr old male mixed-breed dog was referred with dyspnea and abdominal pain after a road traffic accident. Plain radiographs demonstrated pleural effusion and reduced serosal detail in the abdominal cavity that was compatible with fluid accumulation. Retrograde urethrography revealed a pelvic urethra rupture. Biochemical analysis of the pleural and abdominal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of urothorax and uroperitoneum. The dog underwent a prepubic urethrostomy and intensive care management. The dog was reported to be in good health after a follow up time of 10 mo. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of urothorax associated with uroperitoneum with no detectable defects of the diaphragm in a dog.


Title #520: An Unusual Case of a Nasal Foreign Body in a Cat with Chronic Nasal Discharge.
PMID: 26083437
Authors: Emma E. Bellei, Luciano L. Pisoni, Monika M. Joechler, Marco M. Pietra
Abstract: This report describes a cat infected with the feline infectious virus and a 1 yr history of unilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. Intraoral radiography and endoscopic examination revealed the presence of a large fragment of tooth root in the right nasal cavity. The cat had previously undergone maxillary canine tooth (104) extraction. The root was successfully removed by an endoscopic-assisted procedure, and follow-up examination 1 yr later documented complete disappearance of the respiratory signs.


Title #521: Clinical Signs, Treatment, and Outcome in Cats with Myeloma-Related Disorder Receiving Systemic Therapy.
PMID: 26083436
Authors: Claire M CM. Cannon, Christina C. Knudson, Antonella A. Borgatti
Abstract: Myeloma-related disorder (MRD) is an uncommon disease in cats, for which there is no established standard of care. In this retrospective study, we evaluated presentation, response to treatment, and toxicity in cats with MRD receiving systemic treatment. Previously reported prognostic factors were evaluated for their impact on survival in cats receiving chemotherapy. Of fifteen cases identified, thirteen received melphalan or cyclophosphamide +/- corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Chlorambucil was commonly used as rescue therapy in cats with progressive disease, or in cases of chemotherapy-related toxicity with first line agents. Overall response rates were 71% and 83% for melphalan- and cyclophosphamide-treated cats, respectively. Discontinuation of melphalan due to toxicity was common. Survival times for cats initially treated with melphalan or cyclophosphamide were not significantly different (median 252 and 394 days, respectively), and no statistically significant prognostic factors were identified. This study suggests that the combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids is well tolerated and may be considered as first-line therapy for cats with systemic MRD.


Title #522: Congenital Extrahepatic Abdominal Arteriovenous Fistula and Apparent Patent Ductus Venosus in a Dog.
PMID: 26083435
Authors: Robert N RN. White, Kate K. Murphy, Helen H. Renfrew, Chris C. Shales
Abstract: A 3 mo old male German shepherd dog presented with a 2 wk history of diarrhea with possible melena followed by inappetence and progressive abdominal distension. Clinical findings, serum biochemical analysis, and abdominal ultrasound were highly suggestive of an extrahepatic abdominal arteriovenous fistula and concurrent patent ductus venosus, which were confirmed during an abdominal exploratory surgery. Renal biopsies taken at the time of surgery confirmed a chronic glomerulopathy. The dog made a good initial recovery from the procedure but was euthanatized 6 wk postoperatively for medically unresponsive renal disease.


Title #523: Cerebral Ventriculitis Associated with Otogenic Meningoencephalitis in a Dog.
PMID: 26083434
Authors: Chih-Ching CC. Wu, Ya-Pei YP. Chang
Abstract: A dog was evaluated for rapidly progressive mentation change, ataxia, and tetraparesis. The dog's neurological status deteriorated drastically. It became comatose with bilateral mydriasis, and the pupillary light reflex was absent. An anti-inflammatory dose of methylprednisolone was administered, and temporary stabilization of neurological status was achieved. MRI findings were suggestive of ventriculitis and meningoencephalitis originating from the left tympanic cavity. A gadolinium leakage phenomenon was noted, likely resulting from severe damage to the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier during the inflammatory process. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and materials in the left tympanic cavity further confirmed the diagnosis. Following surgical and antibiotic treatment, the dog recovered well with only a mild residual head tilt. Seven months after surgery, the dog had a recurrent infection of the left tympanic cavity without intracranial involvement. A second surgery led to an uneventful recovery, and the dog was clinically normal except for a mild head tilt 3 yr after the initial presentation. This is the first report describing ventriculitis associated with otogenic meningoencephalitis in dogs and a gadolinium leakage phenomenon displayed on MRI. The long-term outcome of ventriculitis-complicated otogenic meningoencephalitis in dogs could be satisfied with prompt diagnosis and treatment.

Title #525: First Demonstration of Antigen Induced Cytokine Expression by CD4-1+ Lymphocytes in a Poikilotherm: Studies in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
PMID: 26083432

Abstract: Adaptive immunity in homeotherms depends greatly on CD4+ Th cells which release cytokines in response to specific antigen stimulation. Whilst bony fish and poikilothermic tetrapods possess cells that express TcR and CD4-related genes (that exist in two forms in teleost fish; termed CD4-1 and CD4-2), to date there is no unequivocal demonstration that cells equivalent to Th exist. Thus, in this study we determined whether CD4-1+ lymphocytes can express cytokines typical of Th cells following antigen specific stimulation, using the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Initially, we analyzed the CD4 locus in zebrafish and found three CD4 homologues, a CD4-1 molecule and two CD4-2 molecules. The zfCD4-1 and zfCD4-2 transcripts were detected in immune organs and were most highly expressed in lymphocytes. A polyclonal antibody to zfCD4-1 was developed and used with an antibody to ZAP70 and revealed double positive cells by immunohistochemistry, and in the Mycobacterium marinum disease model CD4-1+ cells were apparent surrounding the granulomas typical of the infection. Next a prime-boost experiment, using human gamma globulin as antigen, was performed and revealed for the first time in fish that zfCD4-1+ lymphocytes increase the expression of cytokines and master transcription factors relevant to Th1/Th2-type responses as a consequence of boosting with specific antigen.


Title #526: Changes in Lignin and Polysaccharide Components in 13 Cultivars of Rice Straw following Dilute Acid Pretreatment as Studied by Solution-State 2D 1H-13C NMR.
PMID: 26083431

Abstract: A renewable raw material, rice straw is pretreated for biorefinery usage. Solution-state two-dimensional (2D) 1H-13 C hetero-nuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, was used to analyze 13 cultivars of rice straw before and after dilute acid pretreatment, to characterize general changes in the lignin and polysaccharide components. Intensities of most (15 of 16) peaks related to lignin aromatic regions, such as p-coumarate, guaiacyl, syringyl, p-hydroxyphenyl, and cinnamyl alcohol, and methoxyl, increased or remained unchanged after pretreatment. In contrast, intensities of most (11 of 13) peaks related to lignin aliphatic linkages or ferulate decreased. Decreased heterogeneity in the intensities of three peaks related to cellulose components in acid-insoluble residues resulted in similar glucose yield (0.45-0.59 g/g-dry biomass). Starch-derived components showed positive correlations (r = 0.71 to 0.96) with glucose, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), and formate concentrations in the liquid hydrolysates, and negative correlations (r = -0.95 to -0.97) with xylose concentration and acid-insoluble residue yield. These results showed the fate of lignin and polysaccharide components by pretreatment, suggesting that lignin aromatic regions and cellulose components were retained in the acid insoluble residues and starch-derived components were transformed into glucose, 5-HMF, and formate in the liquid hydrolysate.


Title #527: Autoantibody-Targeted Treatments for Acute Exacerbations of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PMID: 26083430
Authors: Michael M. Donahoe, Vincent G VG. Valentine, Nydia N. Chien, Kevin F KF. Gibson, Jay S JS. Raval, Melissa M. Saul, Jianmin J. Xue, Yingze Y. Zhang, Steven R SR. Duncan
Abstract: Severe acute exacerbations (AE) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are medically untreatable and often fatal within days. Recent evidence suggests autoantibodies may be involved in IPF progression. Autoantibody-mediated lung diseases are typically refractory to glucocorticoids and nonspecific medications, but frequently respond to focused autoantibody reduction treatments. We conducted a pilot trial to test the hypothesis that autoantibody-targeted therapies may also benefit AE-IPF patients.


Title #528: A Virulent Babesia bovis Strain Failed to Infect White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus).
PMID: 26083429
Authors: Massaro W MW. Ueti, Pia U PU. Olafson, Jeanne M JM. Freeman, Wendell C WC. Johnson, Glen A GA. Scoles
Abstract: Wildlife are an important component in the vector-host-pathogen triangle of livestock diseases, as they maintain biological vectors that transmit pathogens and can serve as reservoirs for such infectious pathogens. Babesia bovis is a tick-borne pathogen, vectored by cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus spp., that can cause up to 90% mortality in naive adult cattle. While cattle are the primary host for cattle fever ticks, wild and exotic ungulates, including white-tailed deer (WTD), are known to be viable alternative hosts. The presence of cattle fever tick populations resistant to acaricides raises concerns regarding the possibility of these alternative hosts introducing tick-borne babesial parasites into areas free of infection. Understanding the B. bovis reservoir competence of these alternative hosts is critical to mitigating the risk of introduction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that WTD are susceptible to infection with a B. bovis strain lethal to cattle. Two groups of deer were inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or a larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites from infected R. microplus larvae. The collective data demonstrated that WTD are neither a transient host nor reservoir of B. bovis. This conclusion is supported by the failure of B. bovis to establish an infection in deer regardless of inoculum. Although specific antibody was detected for a short period in the WTD, the PCR results were consistently negative at multiple time points throughout the experiment and blood from WTD that had been exposed to parasite, transferred into naÃ¯ve recipient susceptible calves, failed to establish infection. In contrast, naÃ¯ve steers inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or the larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites rapidly succumbed to disease. These findings provide evidence that WTD are not an epidemiological component in the maintenance of B. bovis infectivity to livestock.

Title #530: Regional Anesthesia to Scalp for Craniotomy: Innovation With Innervation.
PMID: 26083426
Authors: Kavitha K. Jayaram, Moningi M. Srilata, Dilipkumar D. Kulkarni, Gopinath G. Ramachandran
Abstract: Effective management and pain prevention is of great importance to avoid postoperative complications such as hypertension, agitation, and vomiting. All these adverse events may lead to elevation in intracranial pressure and, in turn, unfavorable outcome and prolonged hospital stay. Development of multiple methods of analgesia may contribute to the alleviation of problems due to pain. We tested the effectiveness of bilateral maxillary block with greater and lesser occipital nerve block for providing analgesia to the scalp.


Title #531: The Effect of General Anesthesia on the Microelectrode Recordings From Pallidal Neurons in Patients With Dystonia.
PMID: 26083425
Authors: Lashmi L. Venkatraghavan, Evgeny E. Rakhman, Vibhor V. Krishna, Francesco F. Sammartino, Pirjo P. Manninen, William W. Hutchison
Abstract: The most common anesthetic technique for patients undergoing insertion of deep brain stimulators (DBS) is local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation as this facilitates intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) for target localization. However, general anesthesia (GA) may be needed in some of the patients especially those with dystonia. The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of GA on MERs from pallidal neurons in patients with dystonia undergoing DBS implantation surgery.


Title #532: Automated Software Analysis of Fetal Movement Recorded during a Pregnant Woman's Sleep at Home.
PMID: 26083422

Abstract: Fetal movement is an important biological index of fetal well-being. Since 2008, we have been developing an original capacitive acceleration sensor and device that a pregnant woman can easily use to record fetal movement by herself at home during sleep. In this study, we report a newly developed automated software system for analyzing recorded fetal movement. This study will introduce the system and compare its results to those of a manual analysis of the same fetal movement signals (Experiment I). We will also demonstrate an appropriate way to use the system (Experiment II). In Experiment I, fetal movement data reported previously for six pregnant women at 28-38 gestational weeks were used. We evaluated the agreement of the manual and automated analyses for the same 10-sec epochs using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) including quantitative indicators for prevalence and bias. The mean PABAK value was 0.83, which can be considered almost perfect. In Experiment II, twelve pregnant women at 24-36 gestational weeks recorded fetal movement at night once every four weeks. Overall, mean fetal movement counts per hour during maternal sleep significantly decreased along with gestational weeks, though individual differences in fetal development were noted. This newly developed automated analysis system can provide important data throughout late pregnancy.


Title #533: Oral Delivery of a Novel Attenuated Salmonella Vaccine Expressing Influenza A Virus Proteins Protects Mice against H5N1 and H1N1 Viral Infection.
PMID: 26083421

Abstract: Attenuated strains of invasive enteric bacteria, such as Salmonella, represent promising gene delivery agents for nucleic acid-based vaccines as they can be administrated orally. In this study, we constructed a novel attenuated strain of Salmonella for the delivery and expression of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus. We showed that the constructed Salmonella strain exhibited efficient gene transfer activity for HA and NA expression and little cytotoxicity and pathogenicity in mice. Using BALB/c mice as the model, we evaluated the immune responses and protection induced by the constructed Salmonella-based vaccine. Our study showed that the Salmonella-based vaccine induced significant production of anti-HA serum IgG and mucosal IgA, and of anti-HA interferon-Î³ producing T cells in orally vaccinated mice. Furthermore, mice orally vaccinated with the Salmonella vaccine expressing viral HA and NA proteins were completely protected from lethal challenge of highly pathogenic H5N1 as well as H1N1 influenza viruses while none of the animals treated with the Salmonella vaccine carrying the empty expression vector with no viral antigen expression was protected. These results suggest that the Salmonella-based vaccine elicits strong antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and provides effective immune protection against multiple strains of influenza viruses. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the feasibility of developing novel attenuated Salmonella strains as new oral vaccine vectors against influenza viruses.


Title #534: Hunting the Extinct Steppe Bison (Bison priscus) Mitochondrial Genome in the Trois-FrÃ¨res Paleolithic Painted Cave.
PMID: 26083419
Authors: Marie-Claude MC. Marsolier-Kergoat, Pauline P. Palacio, VÃ©ronique V. Berthonaud, FrÃ©dÃ©ric F. Maksud, Thomas T. Stafford, Robert R. BÃ©gouÃ«n, Jean-Marc JM. Elalouf
Abstract: Despite the abundance of fossil remains for the extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus), an animal that was painted and engraved in numerous European Paleolithic caves, a complete mitochondrial genome sequence has never been obtained for this species. In the present study we collected bone samples from a sector of the Trois-FrÃ¨res Paleolithic cave (AriÃ¨ge, France) that formerly functioned as a pitfall and was sealed before the end of the Pleistocene. Screening the DNA content of the samples collected from the ground surface revealed their contamination by Bos DNA. However, a 19,000-year-old rib collected on a rock apart the pathway delineated for modern visitors was devoid of such contaminants and reproducibly yielded Bison priscus DNA. High-throughput shotgun sequencing combined with conventional PCR analysis of the rib DNA extract enabled to reconstruct a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of 16,318 bp for the extinct steppe bison with a 10.4-fold coverage. Phylogenetic analyses robustly established the position of the Bison priscus mitochondrial genome as basal to the clade delineated by the genomes of the modern American Bison bison. The extinct steppe bison sequence, which exhibits 93 specific polymorphisms as compared to the published Bison bison mitochondrial genomes, provides an additional resource for the study of Bovinae specimens. Moreover this study of ancient DNA delineates a new research pathway for the analysis of the Magdalenian Trois-FrÃ¨res cave.

Abstract: The prefrontal (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) appear to be associated with both executive functions and olfaction. However, there is little data relating olfactory processing and executive functions in humans. The present study aimed at exploring the role of olfaction on executive functioning, making a distinction between primary and more cognitive aspects of olfaction. Three executive tasks of similar difficulty were used. One was used to assess hot executive functions (Iowa Gambling Task-IGT), and two as a measure of cold executive functioning (Stroop Colour and Word Test-SCWT and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-WCST). Sixty two healthy participants were included: 31 with normosmia and 31 with hyposmia. Olfactory abilities were assessed using the ''Sniffin' Sticks'' test and the olfactory threshold, odour discrimination and odour identification measures were obtained. All participants were female, aged between 18 and 60. Results showed that participants with hyposmia displayed worse performance in decision making (IGT; Cohen's-d = 0.91) and cognitive flexibility (WCST; Cohen's-d between 0.54 and 0.68) compared to those with normosmia. Multiple regression adjusted by the covariates participants' age and education level showed a positive association between odour identification and the cognitive inhibition response (SCWT-interference; Beta = 0.29; p = .034). The odour discrimination capacity was not a predictor of the cognitive executive performance. Our results suggest that both hot and cold executive functions seem to be associated with higher-order olfactory functioning in humans. These results robustly support the hypothesis that olfaction and executive measures have a common neural substrate in PFC and OFC, and suggest that olfaction might be a reliable cognitive marker in psychiatric and neurologic disorders.

Abstract: Local variation in the abundance and richness of vascular epiphytes is often attributed to environmental characteristics such as substrate and microclimate. Less is known, however, about the impacts of tree and branch turnover on epiphyte communities. To address this issue, we surveyed branches and epiphytes found on the forest floor in 96 transects in two forests (Atlantic rainforest in Brazil and Caribbean rainforest in Panama). In the Brazilian forest, we additionally distinguished between edge and core study sites. We quantified branch abundance, epiphyte abundance, richness and proportion of adults to investigate the trends of these variables over branch diameter. Branches <2 cm in diameter comprised >90% of all branches on the forest floor. Abundance and richness of fallen epiphytes per transect were highest in the Brazilian core transects and lowest in the Panamanian transects. The majority of epiphytes on the floor (c. 65%) were found attached to branches. At all three study sites, branch abundance and branch diameter were negatively correlated, whereas epiphyte abundance and richness per branch, as well as the proportion of adults were positively correlated with branch diameter. The relationship between branch diameter and absolute epiphyte abundance or richness differed between study sites, which might be explained by differences in forest structure and dynamics. In the Panamanian forest, epiphytes had been previously inventoried, allowing an evaluation of our surveying method by comparing canopy and forest floor samplings. Individuals found on the forest floor corresponded to 13% of all individuals on branches <10 cm in diameter (including crowns), with abundance, richness and composition trends on forest floor reflecting canopy trends. We argue that forest floor surveys provide useful floristic and, most notably, demographic information particularly on epiphytes occurring on the thinnest branches, which are least accessible. Here, branchfall acts as an important demographic filter structuring epiphyte communities.

Title #539: The Î½SaÎ± Specific Lipoprotein Like Cluster (lpl) of S. aureus USA300 Contributes to Immune Stimulation and Invasion in Human Cells.

Abstract: All Staphylococcus aureus genomes contain a genomic island, which is termed Î½SaÎ± and characterized by two clusters of tandem repeat sequences, i.e. the exotoxin (set) and 'lipoprotein-like' genes (lpl). Based on their structural similarities the Î½SaÎ± islands have been classified as type I to IV. The genomes of highly pathogenic and particularly epidemic S. aureus strains (USA300, N315, Mu50, NCTC8325, Newman, COL, JH1 or JH9) belonging to the clonal complexes CC5 and CC8 bear a type I Î½SaÎ± island. Since the contribution of the lpl gene cluster encoded in the Î½SaÎ± island to virulence is unclear to date, we deleted the entire lpl gene cluster in S. aureus USA300. The results showed that the mutant was deficient in the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes, macrophages and keratinocytes. Purified lipoprotein Lpl1 was further shown to elicit a TLR2-dependent response. Furthermore, heterologous expression of the USA300 lpl cluster in other S. aureus strains enhanced their immune stimulatory activity. Most importantly, the lpl cluster contributed to invasion of S. aureus into human keratinocytes and mouse skin and the non-invasive S. carnosus expressing the lpl gene cluster became invasive. Additionally, in a murine kidney abscess model the bacterial burden in the kidneys was higher in wild type than in mutant mice. In this infection model the lpl cluster, thus, contributes to virulence. The present report is one of the first studies addressing the role of the Î½SaÎ± encoded lpl gene cluster in staphylococcal virulence. The finding that the lpl gene cluster contributes to internalization into non-professional antigen presenting cells such as keratinocytes highlights the lpl as a new cell surface component that triggers host cell invasion by S. aureus. Increased invasion in murine skin and an increased bacterial burden in a murine kidney abscess model suggest that the lpl gene cluster serves as an important virulence factor.


Title #540: Periostin Is a Key Niche Component for Wound Metastasis of Melanoma.

Abstract: Tissue injury promotes metastasis of several human cancers, although factors associated with wound healing that attract circulating tumor cells have remained unknown. Here, we examined the primary and metastatic lesions that appeared 1 month after trauma in a patient with acral lentiginous melanoma. The levels of mRNA for periostin (POSTN), type 1 collagen, and fibronectin were significantly increased in the metastatic lesion relative to the primary lesion. The increase of these extracellular matrix proteins at the wound site was reproduced in a mouse model of wound healing, with the upregulation of Postn mRNA persisting the longest. POSTN was expressed in the region surrounding melanoma cell nests in metastatic lesions of both wounded mice and the patient. POSTN attenuated the cell adhesion and promoted the migration of melanoma cells without affecting their proliferation in vitro. In the mouse model, the wound site as well as subcutaneously injected osteoblasts that secrete large amounts of POSTN invited the metastasis of remotely-transplanted melanoma cells on the sites. Osteoblasts with suppression of POSTN by shRNA showed a greatly reduced ability to promote such metastasis. Our results suggest that POSTN is a key factor in promoting melanoma cell metastasis to wound sites by providing a premetastatic niche.


Title #541: SerpinB2 (PAI-2) Modulates Proteostasis via Binding Misfolded Proteins and Promotion of Cytoprotective Inclusion Formation.

Abstract: SerpinB2 (PAI-2), a member of the clade B family of serine protease inhibitors, is one of the most upregulated proteins following cellular stress. Originally described as an inhibitor of urokinase plasminogen activator, its predominant cytoplasmic localisation suggests an intracellular function. SerpinB2 has been reported to display cytoprotective properties in neurons and to interact with intracellular proteins including components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In the current study we explored the potential role of SerpinB2 as a modulator of proteotoxic stress. Initially, we transiently transfected wild-type SerpinB2 and SerpinB2-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Huntingtin exon1-polyglutamine (fused C-terminally to mCherry). Inclusion body formation as result of Huntingtin aggregation was evident in the SerpinB2 expressing cells but significantly impaired in the SerpinB2-/- cells, the latter concomitant with loss in cell viability. Importantly, recovery of the wild-type phenotype and cell viability was rescued by retroviral transduction of SerpinB2 expression. SerpinB2 modestly attenuated Huntingtin and amyloid beta fibril formation in vitro and was able to bind preferentially to misfolded proteins. Given the modest chaperone-like activity of SerpinB2 we tested the ability of SerpinB2 to modulate UPS and autophagy activity using a GFP reporter system and autophagy reporter, respectively. Activity of the UPS was reduced and autophagy was dysregulated in SerpinB2-/- compared to wild-type MEFs. Moreover, we observed a non-covalent interaction between ubiquitin and SerpinB2 in cells using GFP-pulldown assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We conclude that SerpinB2 plays an important role in proteostasis as its loss leads to a proteotoxic phenotype associated with an inability to compartmentalize aggregating proteins and a reduced capacity of the UPS.


Title #542: Pareto Optimization Identifies Diverse Set of Phosphorylation Signatures Predicting Response to Treatment with Dasatinib.
PMID: 26083411
Authors: Martin M. Klammer, J Nikolaj JN. Dybowski, Daniel D. Hoffmann, Christoph C. Schaab
Abstract: Multivariate biomarkers that can predict the effectiveness of targeted therapy in individual patients are highly desired. Previous biomarker discovery studies have largely focused on the identification of single biomarker signatures, aimed at maximizing prediction accuracy. Here, we present a different approach that identifies multiple biomarkers by simultaneously optimizing their predictive power, number of features, and proximity to the drug target in a protein-protein interaction network. To this end, we incorporated NSGA-II, a fast and elitist multi-objective optimization algorithm that is based on the principle of Pareto optimality, into the biomarker discovery workflow. The method was applied to quantitative phosphoproteome data of 19 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines from a previous biomarker study. The algorithm successfully identified a total of 77 candidate biomarker signatures predicting response to treatment with dasatinib. Through filtering and similarity clustering, this set was trimmed to four final biomarker signatures, which then were validated on an independent set of breast cancer cell lines. All four candidates reached the same good prediction accuracy (83%) as the originally published biomarker. Although the newly discovered signatures were diverse in their composition and in their size, the central protein of the originally published signature - integrin Î²4 (ITGB4) - was also present in all four Pareto signatures, confirming its pivotal role in predicting dasatinib response in NSCLC cell lines. In summary, the method presented here allows for a robust and simultaneous identification of multiple multivariate biomarkers that are optimized for prediction performance, size, and relevance.

Title #545: Catheter Ablation of Right-Sided Accessory Pathways in Adults Using the Three-Dimensional Mapping System: A Randomized Comparison to the Conventional Approach.
PMID: 26083408
Authors: Yuedong Y. Ma, Jia J. Qiu, Yang Y. Yang, Anli A. Tang
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) mapping and navigation systems have been widely used for the ablation of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, but the applicability of these systems for the ablation of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to right-sided accessory pathways (RAPs) remains unknown. The goal of this prospective randomized study was to compare the safety, efficiency, and efficacy of nonfluoroscopic and conventional fluoroscopic mapping techniques in guiding catheter ablation of SVT due to RAPs. Of the 393 consecutive patients with SVT who were randomized to receive either conventional fluoroscopic or Ensite NavX mapping-guided ablation, 64 patients with RAPs were included for analysis. Endpoints for ablation were no evidence of RAP conduction and no inducible atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). The 3D group showed fewer ablation pulses and a shorter total ablation time compared to the conventional group, although the acute procedural success did not differ significantly between the two groups. Total procedure time, electrophysiological study time, total fluoroscopy time, and cumulative radiation doses were also significantly reduced in the 3D group. Patients in the conventional group with a right atrium diameter (RAD) â¥ 47 mm required a longer fluoroscopy time. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rates between the two groups over a follow-up period of 3 to 29 months. There were no permanent complications. The 3D mapping system may be a preferred alternative for patients with AVRT due to RAPs, especially for patients with a large RAD (â¥ 47 mm).


Title #546: Graphene-and-Copper Artificial Nacre Fabricated by a Preform Impregnation Process: Bioinspired Strategy for Strengthening-Toughening of Metal Matrix Composite.
PMID: 26083407

Abstract: Metals can be strengthened by adding hard reinforcements, but such strategy usually compromises ductility and toughness. Natural nacre consists of hard and soft phases organized in a regular 'brick-and-mortar' structure and exhibits a superior combination of mechanical strength and toughness, which is an attractive model for strengthening and toughening artificial composites, but such bioinspired metal matrix composite has yet to be made. Here we prepared nacre-like reduced graphene oxide (RGrO) reinforced Cu matrix composite based on a preform impregnation process, by which two-dimensional RGrO was used as 'brick' and inserted into 'â¡-and-mortar' ordered porous Cu preform (the symbol 'â¡' means the absence of 'brick'), followed by compacting. This process realized uniform dispersion and alignment of RGrO in Cu matrix simultaneously. The RGrO-and-Cu artificial nacres exhibited simultaneous enhancement on yield strength and ductility as well as increased modulus, attributed to RGrO strengthening, effective crack deflection and a possible combined failure mode of RGrO. The artificial nacres also showed significantly higher strengthening efficiency than other conventional Cu matrix composites, which might be related to the alignment of RGrO.


Title #547: Remodeling of glial coverage of glutamatergic synapses in the rat nucleus tractus solitarii after ozone inhalation.

Abstract: Besides the well-described inflammatory and dysfunction effects on the respiratory tract, accumulating evidence indicates that ozone (O3 ) exposure also affects central nervous system functions. However, the mechanisms through which O3 exerts toxic effects on the brain remain poorly understood. We previously showed that O3 exposure caused a neuronal activation in regions of the rat nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) overlapping terminal fields of vagal lung afferents. Knowing that O3 exposure can impact astrocytic protein expression, we decided to investigate whether it may induce astroglial cellular alterations in the NTS. Using electron microscopy and immunoblot techniques, we showed that in O3 -exposed animals, the astrocytic coverage of NTS glutamatergic synapses was 19% increased while the astrocyte volume fraction and membrane density were not modified. Moreover, the expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and S100Î², which are known to be increased in reactive astroglia, did not change. These results indicate that O3 inhalation induces a glial plasticity that is restricted to the peri-synaptic coverage without overall astroglial activation. Taken together, these findings, along with our previous observations, support the conclusion that O3 -induced pulmonary inflammation results in a specific activation of vagal lung afferents rather than non-specific overall brain alterations mediated by blood-borne agents.

Title #549: Giant Clams and Rising CO2: Light May Ameliorate Effects of Ocean Acidification on a Solar-Powered Animal.
PMID: 26083404
Authors: Sue-Ann SA. Watson
Abstract: Global climate change and ocean acidification pose a serious threat to marine life. Marine invertebrates are particularly susceptible to ocean acidification, especially highly calcareous taxa such as molluscs, echinoderms and corals. The largest of all bivalve molluscs, giant clams, are already threatened by a variety of local pressures, including overharvesting, and are in decline worldwide. Several giant clam species are listed as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and now climate change and ocean acidification pose an additional threat to their conservation. Unlike most other molluscs, giant clams are 'solar-powered' animals containing photosynthetic algal symbionts suggesting that light could influence the effects of ocean acidification on these vulnerable animals. In this study, juvenile fluted giant clams Tridacna squamosa were exposed to three levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) (control ~400, mid ~650 and high ~950 Î¼atm) and light (photosynthetically active radiation 35, 65 and 304 Î¼mol photons m-2 s-1). Elevated CO2 projected for the end of this century (~650 and ~950 Î¼atm) reduced giant clam survival and growth at mid-light levels. However, effects of CO2 on survival were absent at high-light, with 100% survival across all CO2 levels. Effects of CO2 on growth of surviving clams were lessened, but not removed, at high-light levels. Shell growth and total animal mass gain were still reduced at high-CO2. This study demonstrates the potential for light to alleviate effects of ocean acidification on survival and growth in a threatened calcareous marine invertebrate. Managing water quality (e.g. turbidity and sedimentation) in coastal areas to maintain water clarity may help ameliorate some negative effects of ocean acidification on giant clams and potentially other solar-powered calcifiers, such as hard corals.


Title #550: The Expert-Generalist: A Contradiction Whose Time Has Come.
PMID: 26083403
Authors: Joseph J JJ. Fins
Abstract: The author suggests the creation of expert-generalists to help provide the additional cost-effective access to care necessitated by increased insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Expert-generalists, a concept drawn from an extant Canadian model, would be a cohort of primary care physicians who obtain additional training in a subspecialty area, which would widen their practice portfolio and bring enhanced infrastructure to primary care settings. Expanding the reach of primary care into the realm of more advanced subspecialty practice could be a way to enhance both access to and quality of care in a cost-effective fashion, in part because the educational framework for additional training already exists. Trainees could opt for an extra year of training after traditional residency or return to training after years in practice. Properly trained, an expert-generalist would benefit both the quality of the patient experience and the bottom line by expertly triaging patients to determine who will truly benefit from specialty consultations, decreasing specialists' engagement with cases that do not require their higher-tier care. The author considers the merits of this proposal, as well as potential objections and implementation challenges. It is suggested that this model be adopted incrementally, using demonstration projects that could assess the impact of an expert-generalist initiative on the physician workforce and on patients' access to quality primary and specialty care.


Title #551: The Education Review Board: A Mechanism for Managing Potential Conflicts of Interest in Medical Education.
PMID: 26083402

Abstract: Concerns about the influence of industry support on medical education, research, and patient care have increased in both medical and political circles. Some academic medical centers, questioning whether industry support of medical education could be appropriate and not a conflict of interest, banned such support. In 2009, a Partners HealthCare System commission concluded that interactions with industry remained important to Partners' charitable academic mission and made recommendations to transparently manage such relationships. An Education Review Board (ERB) was created to oversee and manage all industry support of Partners educational activities.Using a case review method, the ERB developed guidelines to implement the commission's recommendations. A multi-funder rule was established that prohibits industry support from only one company for any Partners educational activity. Within that framework, the ERB established guidelines on industry support of educational conferences, clinical fellowships, and trainees' expenses for attending external educational programs; gifts of textbooks and other educational materials; promotional opportunities associated with Partners educational activities; Partners educational activities under contract with an industry entity; and industry-run programs using Partners resources.Although many changes have resulted from the implementation of the ERB guidelines, the number of industry grants for Partners educational activities has remained relatively stable, and funding for these activities declined only moderately during the first three full calendar years (2011-2013) of ERB oversight. The ERB continually educates both the Partners community and industry about the rationale for its guidelines and its openness to their refinement in response to changes in the external environment.


Title #552: What's in It for Me? Maintenance of Certification as an Incentive for Faculty Supervision of Resident Quality Improvement Projects.
PMID: 26083401
Authors: Glenn G. Rosenbluth, Jeffrey A JA. Tabas, Robert B RB. Baron
Abstract: Residents are required to engage in quality improvement (QI) activities, which requires faculty engagement. Because of increasing program requirements and clinical demands, faculty may be resistant to taking on additional teaching and supervisory responsibilities without incentives. The authors sought to create an authentic benefit for University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Pediatrics Residency Training Program faculty who supervise pediatrics residents' QI projects by offering maintenance of certification (MOC) Part 4 (Performance in Practice) credit.


Title #553: Achieving the Desired Transformation: Thoughts on Next Steps for Outcomes-Based Medical Education.
PMID: 26083400
Authors: Eric S ES. Holmboe, Paul P. Batalden
Abstract: Since the introduction of the outcomes-based medical education (OBME) movement, progress toward implementation has been active but challenging. Much of the angst and criticism has been directed at the approaches to assessment that are associated with outcomes-based or competency frameworks, particularly defining the outcomes. In addition, these changes to graduate medical education (GME) are concomitant with major change in health care systems-specifically, changes to increase quality and safety while reducing cost. Every sector, from medical education to health care delivery and financing, is in the midst of substantial change and disruption.The recent release of the Institute of Medicine's report on the financing and governance of GME highlights the urgent need to accelerate the transformation of medical education. One source of continued tension within the medical education community arises from the assumption that the much-needed increases in value and improvement in health care can be achieved by holding the current educational structures and architecture of learning in place while concomitantly withdrawing resources. The authors of this Perspective seek to reframe the important and necessary debate surrounding the current challenges to implementing OBME. Building on recent change and service theories (e.g., Theory U and coproduction), they propose several areas of redirection, including reexamination of curricular models and greater involvement of learners, teachers, and regulators in cocreating new training models, to help facilitate the desired transformation in medical education.

Abstract: Thrombocytopenia in methotrexate (MTX)-treated cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients connotes the interference of MTX with platelets. Hence, it seemed appealing to appraise the effect of MTX on platelets. Thereby, the mechanism of action of MTX on platelets was dissected. MTX (10 Î¼M) induced activation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bid, Bax and Bad through JNK phosphorylation leading to ÎÎ¨m dissipation, cytochrome c release and caspase activation, culminating in apoptosis. The use of specific inhibitor for JNK abrogates the MTX-induced activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and downstream events confirming JNK phosphorylation by MTX as a key event. We also demonstrate that platelet mitochondria as prime sources of ROS which plays a central role in MTX-induced apoptosis. Further, MTX induces oxidative stress by altering the levels of ROS and glutathione cycle. In parallel, the clinically approved thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and its derivative N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) proficiently alleviate MTX-induced platelet apoptosis and oxidative damage. These findings underpin the dearth of research on interference of therapeutic drugs with platelets, despite their importance in human health and disease. Therefore, the use of antioxidants as supplementary therapy seems to be a safe bet in pathologies associated with altered platelet functions.


Title #556: Overexpression, Purification and Characterisation of the Plasmodium falciparum Hsp70-z (PfHsp70-z) Protein.
PMID: 26083397
Authors: Tawanda T. Zininga, Ikechukwu I. Achilonu, Heinrich H. Hoppe, Earl E. Prinsloo, Heini W HW. Dirr, Addmore A. Shonhai
Abstract: Six Hsp70-like genes are represented on the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. Of these two occur in the cytosol: P. falciparum Hsp70-z (PfHsp70-z) and PfHsp70-1. PfHsp70-1 is a well characterised canonical Hsp70 that facilitates protein quality control and is crucial for the development of malaria parasites. There is very little known about PfHsp70-z. However, PfHsp70-z is known to be essential and is implicated in suppressing aggregation of asparagine-rich proteins of P. falciparum. In addition, its expression at the clinical stage of malaria correlates with disease prognosis. Based on structural evidence PfHsp70-z belongs to the Hsp110 family of proteins. Since Hsp110 proteins have been described as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) of their canonical Hsp70 counterparts, it has been speculated that PfHsp70-z may serve as a NEF of PfHsp70-1. In the current study, P. falciparum cells cultured in vitro were subjected to heat stress, triggering the enhanced expression of PfHsp70-z. Biochemical assays conducted using recombinant PfHsp70-z protein demonstrated that the protein is heat stable and possesses ATPase activity. Furthermore, we observed that PfHsp70-z is capable of self-association. The structural-functional features of PfHsp70-z provide further evidence for its role as a chaperone and possible nucleotide exchange factor of PfHsp70-1.


Title #557: Rhodium(iii)-catalyzed cascade oxidative annulation reactions of aryl imidazolium salts with alkynes involving multiple C-H bond activation.
PMID: 26083396
Authors: Qingmei Q. Ge, Bin B. Li, Haibin H. Song, Baiquan B. Wang
Abstract: The cascade oxidative annulation reactions of aryl imidazolium salts with alkynes proceed efficiently in the presence of [Cp*RhCl2]2 and Cu(OAc)2Â·H2O to give substituted imidazo[1,2-a]-quinolinium salts and benzo[ij]imidazo[2,1,5-de]quinolizinium salts. The reactions were through the normal and abnormal N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-directed cyclometalation, alkyne insertion into the Rh-C bond, and reductive elimination of alkenyl and NHC ligands. The reactions are highly regioselective with unsymmetrical alkynes and can be achieved stepwise by controlling the reaction conditions. This provides a new application of NHCs as directing groups and substrates in the synthesis of fused N-heterocyclic compounds. The N-substituting group of the benzo[ij]imidazo[2,1,5-de]quinolizinium salts could be removed successfully with pyridine to afford benzo[ij]imidazo[2,1,5-de]quinolizines in excellent yields. Moreover, some of the benzo[ij]imidazo[2,1,5-de]quinolizinium salts exhibit intense fluorescence which might be useful in organic electronic materials.

Abstract: Composites consisting of nanoparticles of iron oxides and graphene have attracted considerable attention in numerous applications; however, the synthesis methods used to achieve superior functionalities are often complex and unamenable to low-cost large-scale industrial production. Here we report our findings in exploring a simple strategy for low-cost fabrication of multifunctional composites with enhanced properties. In particular, we have successfully prepared FeO(OH)-nanoflake/graphene and nano-Fe3O4/graphene composites from commercially available Fe powders and graphite oxides using a simple and low-cost solid-state process, where the metallic Fe is converted to FeO(OH) nanoflake and graphite oxide is reduced/exfoliated to graphene. The resultant nano-Fe3O4/graphene composite is multifunctional, which demonstrates specific capacities of 802 and 629 mA h g-1, respectively, at 1,000 and 2,000 mA g-1 as an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIB), and further displays efficient catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER); the nominal overpotentials are lower than those for preciously-reported metal-based catalysts (e.g., IrO2, RuO2 and Pt/C). The dramatically enhanced properties are attributed to the synergistic mechanochemical coupling effects between iron oxide and graphene introduced by the facile process, which is well suited for large-scale cost-effective fabrication.

Title #560: Surface Modified Nanocellulose Fibers Yield Conducting Polymer-Based Flexible Supercapacitors with Enhanced Capacitances.
PMID: 26083393
Authors: Zhaohui Z. Wang, Daniel O DO. Carlsson, Petter P. Tammela, Kai K. Hua, Peng P. Zhang, Leif L. Nyholm, Maria M. Stromme
Abstract: We demonstrate that surface modified nanocellulose fibers (NCFs) can be used as substrates to synthesize supercapacitor electrodes with the highest full electrode-normalized gravimetric (127âFâg-1) and volumetric (122âFâcm-3) capacitances at high current densities (300 mA cm-2 â 33 A g-1) till date reported for conducting polymer-based electrodes with active mass loadings as high as 9 mg cm-2. By introducing quaternary amine groups on the surface of NCFs prior to polypyrrole (PPy) polymerization, the macropore volume of the formed PPy-NCF composites can be minimized while maintaining the volume of the micro- and mesopores at the same level as when unmodified or carboxylate groups functionalized NFCs are employed as polymerization substrates. Symmetric, aqueous electrolyte-based, devices comprising these porosity-optimized electrodes exhibit device-specific volumetric energy and power densities of 3.1âmWhâcm-3 and 3âWâcm-3 respectively; which are among the highest values reported for conducting polymer electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. The functionality of the devices is verified by powering a red light-emitting diode with the device in different mechanically challenging states.


Title #561: Down Regulation of CLDND1 Induces Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells.
PMID: 26083392
Authors: Chandrani C. Achari, Sofia S. Winslow, Christer C. Larsson
Abstract: Identification of targets for apoptosis induction is important to provide novel therapeutic approaches in breast cancer. Our earlier studies showed that down regulation of protein kinase C Î´ (PKCÎ´) induces death in breast cancer cells. In this study we set out to identify previously unrecognized apoptosis regulators in breast cancer cells. To identify candidates, global expression analysis with microarray was performed after down regulation of PKCÎ´ in the basal-like breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and BT-549. Genes that were down regulated in all cell lines were further studied for survival-supporting effects. The claudin-like CLDND1 was singled out since several independent siRNAs targeting CLDND1 induced cell death in several cell lines. The cell death induced by CLDND1 knockdown was caspase-dependent, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Nuclear fragmentation, cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria upon CLDND1 depletion demonstrated involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Inhibition of MEK1/2 and JNK further potentiated the cell death induction by CLDND1 knockdown. However, CLDND1 down regulation augmented ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which thereby may protect against the apoptosis inducing effects of CLDND1 down regulation. A concomitant inhibition of MEK1/2 suppresses the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and markedly potentiates the cell death following CLDND1 siRNA treatment. There is today little information on the function of CLDND1. These data provide novel information on CLDND1 and highlight it as a novel survival factor in basal-like breast cancer cell lines.


Title #562: Quality of life and drug compliance: their interrelationship in rheumatic patients.
PMID: 26083391
Authors: Lucie L. Hromadkova, Tomas T. Soukup, Jiri J. Vlcek
Abstract: In rheumatic disorders, one of the treatment objectives is to improve the patient's quality of life (QoL). Similar to other chronic conditions, drug compliance is poor, but necessary for successful treatment. The relationship between drug compliance and QoL has never been tested. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between drug compliance and QoL in patients with different rheumatic disorders.


Title #563: EphA2 Is a Therapy Target in EphA2-Positive Leukemias but Is Not Essential for Normal Hematopoiesis or Leukemia.

Abstract: Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane bound ephrin ligands have been shown to play critical roles in many developmental processes and more recently have been implicated in both normal and pathological processes in post-embryonic tissues. In particular, expression studies of Eph receptors and limited functional studies have demonstrated a role for the Eph/ephrin system in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. In particular, EphA2 was reported on hematopoietic stem cells and stromal cells. There are also reports of EphA2 expression in many different types of malignancies including leukemia, however there is a lack of knowledge in understanding the role of EphA2 in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. We explored the role of EphA2 in hematopoiesis by analyzing wild type and EphA2 knockout mice. Mature, differentiated cells, progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells derived from knockout and control mice were analyzed and no significant abnormality was detected. These studies showed that EphA2 does not have an obligatory role in normal hematopoiesis. Comparative studies using EphA2-negative MLL-AF9 leukemias derived from EphA2-knockout animals showed that there was no detectable functional role for EphA2 in the initiation or progression of the leukemic process. However, expression of EphA2 in leukemias initiated by MLL-AF9 suggested that this protein might be a possible therapy target in this type of leukemia. We showed that treatment with EphA2 monoclonal antibody IF7 alone had no effect on tumorigenicity and latency of the MLL-AF9 leukemias, while targeting of EphA2 using EphA2 monoclonal antibody with a radioactive payload significantly impaired the leukemic process. Altogether, these results identify EphA2 as a potential radio-therapeutic target in leukemias with MLL translocation.

Title #566: RSV-Induced H3K4 Demethylase KDM5B Leads to Regulation of Dendritic Cell-Derived Innate Cytokines and Exacerbates Pathogenesis In Vivo.

Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can result in severe disease partially due to its ability to interfere with the initiation of Th1 responses targeting the production of type I interferons (IFN) and promoting a Th2 immune environment. Epigenetic modulation of gene transcription has been shown to be important in regulating inflammatory pathways. RSV-infected bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) upregulated expression of Kdm5b/Jarid1b H3K4 demethylase. Kdm5b-specific siRNA inhibition in BMDC led to a 10-fold increase in IFN-Î² as well as increases in IL-6 and TNF-Î± compared to control-transfected cells. The generation of Kdm5bfl/fl-CD11c-Cre+ mice recapitulated the latter results during in vitro DC activation showing innate cytokine modulation. In vivo, infection of Kdm5bfl/fl-CD11c-Cre+ mice with RSV resulted in higher production of IFN-Î³ and reduced IL-4 and IL-5 compared to littermate controls, with significantly decreased inflammation, IL-13, and mucus production in the lungs. Sensitization with RSV-infected DCs into the airways of naÃ¯ve mice led to an exacerbated response when mice were challenged with live RSV infection. When Kdm5b was blocked in DCs with siRNA or DCs from Kdm5bfl/fl-CD11c-CRE mice were used, the exacerbated response was abrogated. Importantly, human monocyte-derived DCs treated with a chemical inhibitor for KDM5B resulted in increased innate cytokine levels as well as elicited decreased Th2 cytokines when co-cultured with RSV reactivated CD4+ T cells. These results suggest that KDM5B acts to repress type I IFN and other innate cytokines to promote an altered immune response following RSV infection that contributes to development of chronic disease.

Abstract: The majority of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are unable to retain employment within 10 years from disease onset. Executive abilities, such as planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, inhibition and mental flexibility may have a direct impact on the ability to maintain a job. This study investigated differences in subjective and objective executive abilities between relapsing-remitting MS patients with and without a paid job. We included 55 relapsing-remitting MS patients from a community-based sample (47 females; mean age: 47 years; 36% employed). Patients underwent neurological, cognitive and psychological assessments at their homes, including an extensive executive test battery. We found that unemployed patients had a longer disease duration (t(53)=2.76, p=0.008) and reported more organising and planning problems (Ï2(1)=6.3, p=0.012), higher distractibility (Kendall's tau-b= -0.24, p=0.03) and more cognitive fatigue (U=205.0, p=0.028, r=-0.30) than employed patients. Unemployed patients completed slightly less categories on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (U=243.5, p=0.042, r=-0.28). Possible influential factors such as age, educational level, physical functioning, depression and anxiety did not differ between groups. In conclusion, while relapsing-remitting MS patients without a paid job reported more executive problems and cognitive fatigue than patients with a paid job, little differences were found in objective executive abilities. Further research is needed to examine possible causal relations.


Title #568: A Novel Method for Tracking Individuals of Fruit Fly Swarms Flying in a Laboratory Flight Arena.
PMID: 26083385

Abstract: The growing interest in studying social behaviours of swarming fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, has heightened the need for developing tools that provide quantitative motion data. To achieve such a goal, multi-camera three-dimensional tracking technology is the key experimental gateway. We have developed a novel tracking system for tracking hundreds of fruit flies flying in a confined cubic flight arena. In addition to the proposed tracking algorithm, this work offers additional contributions in three aspects: body detection, orientation estimation, and data validation. To demonstrate the opportunities that the proposed system offers for generating high-throughput quantitative motion data, we conducted experiments on five experimental configurations. We also performed quantitative analysis on the kinematics and the spatial structure and the motion patterns of fruit fly swarms. We found that there exists an asymptotic distance between fruit flies in swarms as the population density increases. Further, we discovered the evidence for repulsive response when the distance between fruit flies approached the asymptotic distance. Overall, the proposed tracking system presents a powerful method for studying flight behaviours of fruit flies in a three-dimensional environment.


Title #569: "Let Me Hear Your Handwriting!" Evaluating the Movement Fluency from Its Sonification.
PMID: 26083384

Abstract: The quality of handwriting is evaluated from the visual inspection of its legibility and not from the movement that generates the trace. Although handwriting is achieved in silence, adding sounds to handwriting movement might help towards its perception, provided that these sounds are meaningful. This study evaluated the ability to judge handwriting quality from the auditory perception of the underlying sonified movement, without seeing the written trace. In a first experiment, samples of a word written by children with dysgraphia, proficient children writers, and proficient adult writers were collected with a graphic tablet. Then, the pen velocity, the fluency, and the axial pen pressure were sonified in order to create forty-five audio files. In a second experiment, these files were presented to 48 adult listeners who had to mark the underlying unseen handwriting. In order to evaluate the relevance of the sonification strategy, two experimental conditions were compared. In a first 'implicit' condition, the listeners made their judgment without any knowledge of the mapping between the sounds and the handwriting variables. In a second 'explicit' condition, they knew what the sonified variables corresponded to and the evaluation criteria. Results showed that, under the implicit condition, two thirds of the listeners marked the three groups of writers differently. In the explicit condition, all listeners marked the dysgraphic handwriting lower than that of the two other groups. In a third experiment, the scores given from the auditory evaluation were compared to the scores given by 16 other adults from the visual evaluation of the trace. Results revealed that auditory evaluation was more relevant than the visual evaluation for evaluating a dysgraphic handwriting. Handwriting sonification might therefore be a relevant tool allowing a therapist to complete the visual assessment of the written trace by an auditory control of the handwriting movement quality.


Title #570: Effects of Aesthetic Chills on a Cardiac Signature of Emotionality.
PMID: 26083383
Authors: Maria M. Sumpf, Sebastian S. Jentschke, Stefan S. Koelsch
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that a cardiac signature of emotionality (referred to as EK, which can be computed from the standard 12 lead electrocardiogram, ECG), predicts inter-individual differences in the tendency to experience and express positive emotion. Here, we investigated whether EK values can be transiently modulated during stimulation with participant-selected music pieces and film scenes that elicit strongly positive emotion.

Title #572: Misconduct Policies, Academic Culture and Career Stage, Not Gender or Pressures to Publish, Affect Scientific Integrity.
PMID: 26083381
Authors: Daniele D. Fanelli, Rodrigo R. Costas, Vincent V. LariviÃ¨re
Abstract: The honesty and integrity of scientists is widely believed to be threatened by pressures to publish, unsupportive research environments, and other structural, sociological and psychological factors. Belief in the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives, but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers, respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest phases of a researcher's career. The hypothesis that males might be prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies, improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent communication amongst researchers.


Title #573: Adaptive Communication: Languages with More Non-Native Speakers Tend to Have Fewer Word Forms.
PMID: 26083380
Authors: Christian C. Bentz, Annemarie A. Verkerk, Douwe D. Kiela, Felix F. Hill, Paula P. Buttery
Abstract: Explaining the diversity of languages across the world is one of the central aims of typological, historical, and evolutionary linguistics. We consider the effect of language contact-the number of non-native speakers a language has-on the way languages change and evolve. By analysing hundreds of languages within and across language families, regions, and text types, we show that languages with greater levels of contact typically employ fewer word forms to encode the same information content (a property we refer to as lexical diversity). Based on three types of statistical analyses, we demonstrate that this variance can in part be explained by the impact of non-native speakers on information encoding strategies. Finally, we argue that languages are information encoding systems shaped by the varying needs of their speakers. Language evolution and change should be modeled as the co-evolution of multiple intertwined adaptive systems: On one hand, the structure of human societies and human learning capabilities, and on the other, the structure of language.


Title #574: Neural Networks for Mindfulness and Emotion Suppression.
PMID: 26083379

Abstract: Mindfulness, an attentive non-judgmental focus on "here and now" experiences, has been incorporated into various cognitive behavioral therapy approaches and beneficial effects have been demonstrated. Recently, mindfulness has also been identified as a potentially effective emotion regulation strategy. On the other hand, emotion suppression, which refers to trying to avoid or escape from experiencing and being aware of one's own emotions, has been identified as a potentially maladaptive strategy. Previous studies suggest that both strategies can decrease affective responses to emotional stimuli. They would, however, be expected to provide regulation through different top-down modulation systems. The present study was aimed at elucidating the different neural systems underlying emotion regulation via mindfulness and emotion suppression approaches. Twenty-one healthy participants used the two types of strategy in response to emotional visual stimuli while functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted. Both strategies attenuated amygdala responses to emotional triggers, but the pathways to regulation differed across the two. A mindful approach appears to regulate amygdala functioning via functional connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex, while suppression uses connectivity with other regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Thus, the two types of emotion regulation recruit different top-down modulation processes localized at prefrontal areas. These different pathways are discussed.


Title #575: Spatio-Temporal Differences in Dystrophin Dynamics at mRNA and Protein Levels Revealed by a Novel FlipTrap Line.
PMID: 26083378
Authors: Frederique F. Ruf-Zamojski, Vikas V. Trivedi, Scott E SE. Fraser, Le A LA. Trinh
Abstract: Dystrophin (Dmd) is a structural protein that links the extracellular matrix to actin filaments in muscle fibers and is required for the maintenance of muscles integrity. Mutations in Dmd lead to muscular dystrophies in humans and other vertebrates. Here, we report the characterization of a zebrafish gene trap line that fluorescently labels the endogenous Dmd protein (Dmd-citrine, Gt(dmd-citrine) ct90a). We show that the Dmd-citrine line recapitulates endogenous dmd transcript expression and Dmd protein localization. Using this Dmd-citrine line, we follow Dmd localization to the myosepta in real-time using time-lapse microscopy, and find that the accumulation of Dmd protein at the transverse myosepta coincides with the onset of myotome formation, a critical stage in muscle maturation. We observed that Dmd protein localizes specifically to the myosepta prior to dmd mRNA localization. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Dmd-citrine line can be used to assess muscular dystrophy following both genetic and physical disruptions of the muscle.


Title #576: Detection of Illicit Drugs by Trained Honeybees (Apis mellifera).
PMID: 26083377
Authors: Matthias M. Schott, Birgit B. Klein, Andreas A. Vilcinskas
Abstract: Illegal drugs exacerbate global social challenges such as substance addiction, mental health issues and violent crime. Police and customs officials often rely on specially-trained sniffer dogs, which act as sensitive biological detectors to find concealed illegal drugs. However, the dog "alert" is no longer sufficient evidence to allow a search without a warrant or additional probable cause because cannabis has been legalized in two US states and is decriminalized in many others. Retraining dogs to recognize a narrower spectrum of drugs is difficult and training new dogs is time consuming, yet there are no analytical devices with the portability and sensitivity necessary to detect substance-specific chemical signatures. This means there is currently no substitute for sniffer dogs. Here we describe an insect screening procedure showing that the western honeybee (Apis mellifera) can sense volatiles associated with pure samples of heroin and cocaine. We developed a portable electroantennographic device for the on-site measurement of volatile perception by these insects, and found a positive correlation between honeybee antennal responses and the concentration of specific drugs in test samples. Furthermore, we tested the ability of honeybees to learn the scent of heroin and trained them to show a reliable behavioral response in the presence of a highly-diluted scent of pure heroin. Trained honeybees could therefore be used to complement or replace the role of sniffer dogs as part of an automated drug detection system. Insects are highly sensitive to volatile compounds and provide an untapped resource for the development of biosensors. Automated conditioning as presented in this study could be developed as a platform for the practical detection of illicit drugs using insect-based sensors.


Title #577: Thiazolidinediones and Risk of Long-Term Dialysis in Diabetic Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease: A Nationwide Cohort Study.
PMID: 26083376

Abstract: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) reduce urinary albumin excretion and proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy. The effect of TZDs on hard renal outcome in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. We investigate the association of TZDs and risk of long-term dialysis or death in diabetic patients with advanced CKD. The nationwide population-based cohort study was conducted using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. From January 2000 to June 2009, 12350 diabetic patients with advanced CKD (serum creatinine levels greater than 6 mg/dL but not yet receiving renal replacement therapy) were selected for the study. We used multivariable Cox regression models and a propensity score-based matching technique to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for development of long-term dialysis and the composite outcome of long-term dialysis or death for TZD users (n=1224) as compared to nonusers (n=11126). During a median follow-up of 6 months, 8270 (67.0%) patients required long-term dialysis and 2593 (21.0%) patients died before starting long-term dialysis. Using propensity score matched analysis, we found TZD users were associated with a lower risk for long-term dialysis (HR, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.86) and the composite outcome of long-term dialysis or death (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91). The results were consistent across most patient subgroups. Use of TZDs among diabetic patients with advanced CKD was associated with lower risk for progression to end-stage renal disease necessitating long-term dialysis or death. Further randomized controlled studies are required to validate this association.


Title #578: Involvement of the Extrageniculate System in the Perception of Optical Illusions: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
PMID: 26083375

Abstract: Research on the neural processing of optical illusions can provide clues for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Previous studies have shown that some visual areas contribute to the perception of optical illusions such as the Kanizsa triangle and MÃ¼ller-Lyer figure; however, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of these and other optical illusions have not been clearly identified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we determined which brain regions are active during the perception of optical illusions. For our study, we enrolled 18 participants. The illusory optical stimuli consisted of many kana letters, which are Japanese phonograms. During the shape task, participants stated aloud whether they perceived the shapes of two optical illusions as being the same or not. During the word task, participants read aloud the kana letters in the stimuli. A direct comparison between the shape and word tasks showed activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, and right pulvinar. It is well known that there are two visual pathways, the geniculate and extrageniculate systems, which belong to the higher-level and primary visual systems, respectively. The pulvinar belongs to the latter system, and the findings of the present study suggest that the extrageniculate system is involved in the cognitive processing of optical illusions.


Title #579: SUMOylation Blocks the Ubiquitin-Mediated Degradation of the Nephronophthisis Gene Product Glis2/NPHP7.
PMID: 26083374
Authors: Haribaskar H. Ramachandran, Konstantin K. Herfurth, Rudolf R. Grosschedl, Tobias T. SchÃ¤fer, Gerd G. Walz
Abstract: Glis2/NPHP7 is a transcriptional regulator mutated in type 7 nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive ciliopathy associated with cystic and fibrotic kidney disease as well as characteristic extrarenal manifestations. While most ciliopathy-associated molecules are found in the cilium, Glis2/NPHP7 presumably localizes to the nucleus. However, the detection of endogenous Glis2/NPHP7 has remained unsuccessful, potentially due to its ubiquitylation-dependent rapid degradation. We report now that Glis2/NPHP7 is also SUMOylated, preferentially by PIAS4, which conjugates Glis2/NPHP7 to SUMO3. SUMOylation interferes with ubiquitylation and degradation of Glis2/NPHP7, suggesting that Glis2/NPHP7 protein levels are regulated by competing ubiquitylation/ SUMOylation. SUMOylation also alters the transcriptional activity of Glis2/NPHP7. While Glis2/NPHP7 activates the mouse insulin-2-promotor (mIns2), SUMOylated Glis2/NPHP7 lacks this property, and seems to act as a repressor. Taken together, our data reveal that Glis2/NPHP7 is extensively modified by post-translational modifications, suggesting that a tight control of this transcriptional regulator is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis.


Title #580: Space Environmental Factor Impacts upon Murine Colon Microbiota and Mucosal Homeostasis.

Abstract: Astronaut intestinal health may be impacted by microgravity, radiation, and diet. The aim of this study was to characterize how high and low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, microgravity, and elevated dietary iron affect colon microbiota (determined by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing) and colon function. Three independent experiments were conducted to achieve these goals: 1) fractionated low LET Î³ radiation (137Cs, 3 Gy, RAD), high Fe diet (IRON) (650 mg/kg diet), and a combination of low LET Î³ radiation and high Fe diet (IRON+RAD) in male Sprague-Dawley rats; 2) high LET 38Si particle exposure (0.050 Gy), 1/6 G partial weight bearing (PWB), and a combination of high LET38Si particle exposure and PWB in female BalbC/ByJ mice; and 3) 13 d spaceflight in female C57BL/6 mice. Low LET radiation, IRON and spaceflight increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. RAD and IRON+RAD increased Lactobacillales and lowered Clostridiales compared to the control (CON) and IRON treatments. Low LET radiation, IRON, and spaceflight did not significantly affect diversity or richness, or elevate pathogenic genera. Spaceflight increased Clostridiales and decreased Lactobacillales, and similar trends were observed in the experiment using a ground-based model of microgravity, suggesting altered gravity may affect colonic microbiota. Although we noted no differences in colon epithelial injury or inflammation, spaceflight elevated TGFÎ² gene expression. Microbiota and mucosal characterization in these models is a first step in understanding the impact of the space environment on intestinal health.


Title #581: Subcellular Localization of Carotenoid Biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
PMID: 26083372
Authors: Lifang L. Zhang, Tiago Toscano TT. SelÃ£o, Eva E. Selstam, Birgitta B. Norling
Abstract: The biosynthesis pathway of carotenoids in cyanobacteria is partly described. However, the subcellular localization of individual steps is so far unknown. Carotenoid analysis of different membrane subfractions in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 shows that "light" plasma membranes have a high carotenoid/protein ratio, when compared to "heavier" plasma membranes or thylakoids. The localization of CrtQ and CrtO, two well-defined carotenoid synthesis pathway enzymes in Synechocystis, was studied by epitope tagging and western blots. Both enzymes are locally more abundant in plasma membranes than in thylakoids, implying that the plasma membrane has higher synthesis rates of Î²-carotene precursor molecules and echinenone.

Abstract: Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. Understanding the survival of Pst during the overwintering period is critical for predicting Pst epidemics in the spring. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods quantifying Pst DNA and RNA (cDNA) were developed and compared for the ability to quantify viable Pst in leaf tissues. Both qPCR of DNA and RNA can provide reliable measurement of viable Pst in plant tissues prior to the late sporulation stage for which qPCR of DNA gave a much higher estimate of fungal biomass than qPCR of RNA. The percentage of Pst biomass that was viable in detached and attached leaves under low temperatures decreased over time. Pst survived longer on attached leaves than on detached leaves. The survival of Pst in cultivars with strong winter-hardiness at 0Â°C and -5Â°C was greater than those with weak winter-hardiness. However, such differences in Pst survival among cultivars were negligible at -10, -15 and -20Â°C. Results indicated that Pst mycelia inside green leaves can also be killed by low temperatures rather than through death of green leaves under low temperatures. The relationship of Pst survival in attached leaves with temperature and winter-hardiness was well described by logistic models. Further field evaluation is necessary to assess whether inclusion of other factors such as moisture and snow cover could improve the model performance in predicting Pst overwintering potential, and hence the epidemic in spring.

Abstract: We report a simple temperature-responsive bioconjugate system comprised of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) decorated with poly[(oligo ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PEGMA) polymers. We used amber suppression to site-specifically incorporate the non-natural azide-functional amino acid p-azidophenylalanine (pAzF) into sfGFP at different positions. The azide moiety on modified sfGFP was then coupled using copper-catalyzed "click" chemistry with the alkyne terminus of a PEGMA synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The protein in the resulting bioconjugate was found to remain functionally active (i.e., fluorescent) after conjugation. Turbidity measurements revealed that the point of attachment of the polymer onto the protein scaffold has an impact on the thermo-responsive behavior of the resultant bioconjugate. Furthermore, small-angle X-ray scattering analysis showed the wrapping of the polymer around the protein in a temperature-depending fashion. Our work demonstrates that standard genetic manipulation combined with an expanded genetic code provides an easy way to construct functional hybrid biomaterials where the location of the conjugation site on the protein plays an important role in determining material properties. We anticipate that our approach could be generalized for the synthesis of complex functional materials with precisely defined domain orientation, connectivity, and composition.


Title #584: Pericentrin Is Related to Abnormal Î²-Cell Insulin Secretion through F-Actin Regulation in Mice.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the regulating effect of pericentrin (PCNT) on insulin secretion in the development of insulin resistance and to determine the underlying mechanism. PCNT expression was studied in different tissues of C57/B6 mice by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunofluorescence. PCNT was highly expressed in organs involved in the regulation of metabolism, while cytoplasmic expression was only enriched in islet cells. PCNT expression was significantly lower in the central regions of insulin resistance (IR) mouse islets than in those of control mouse islets. PCNT expression was further studied in mouse MIN6 cells exposed to glucose stimulation, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PCNT, and an ERK inhibitor (PD98095). The results revealed that PCNT expression in glucose-stimulated MIN6 cells reduced linearly with cytoplasmic insulin levels. MIN6 cells transfected with PCNT siRNA showed significantly decreased intracellular insulin and F-actin expression. The change in F-actin expression in MIN6 cells during PCNT siRNA interference showed a linear relationship with PCNT expression at different time points. The ERK inhibitor affected PCNT expression and F-actin expression linearly. The abnormal insulin secretion observed both in vivo and in vitro was associated with decreased PCNT expression, and F-actin was found to be the target of PCNT regulation.


Title #585: The Herpes Simplex Virus Protein pUL31 Escorts Nucleocapsids to Sites of Nuclear Egress, a Process Coordinated by Its N-Terminal Domain.

Abstract: Progeny capsids of herpesviruses leave the nucleus by budding through the nuclear envelope. Two viral proteins, the membrane protein pUL34 and the nucleo-phosphoprotein pUL31 form the nuclear egress complex that is required for capsid egress out of the nucleus. All pUL31 orthologs are composed of a diverse N-terminal domain with 1 to 3 basic patches and a conserved C-terminal domain. To decipher the functions of the N-terminal domain, we have generated several Herpes simplex virus mutants and show here that the N-terminal domain of pUL31 is essential with basic patches being critical for viral propagation. pUL31 and pUL34 entered the nucleus independently of each other via separate routes and the N-terminal domain of pUL31 was required to prevent their premature interaction in the cytoplasm. Unexpectedly, a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal embedded in this domain was not required for nuclear import of pUL31. In the nucleus, pUL31 associated with the nuclear envelope and newly formed capsids. Viral mutants lacking the N-terminal domain or with its basic patches neutralized still associated with nucleocapsids but were unable to translocate them to the nuclear envelope. Replacing the authentic basic patches with a novel artificial one resulted in HSV1(17+)Lox-UL31-hbpmp1mp2, that was viable but delayed in nuclear egress and compromised in viral production. Thus, while the C-terminal domain of pUL31 is sufficient for the interaction with nucleocapsids, the N-terminal domain was essential for capsid translocation to sites of nuclear egress and a coordinated interaction with pUL34. Our data indicate an orchestrated sequence of events with pUL31 binding to nucleocapsids and escorting them to the inner nuclear envelope. We propose a common mechanism for herpesviral nuclear egress: pUL31 is required for intranuclear translocation of nucleocapsids and subsequent interaction with pUL34 thereby coupling capsid maturation with primary envelopment.


Title #586: Determination of Seed Soundness in Conifers Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa Using Narrow-Multiband Spectral Imaging in the Short-Wavelength Infrared Range.

Abstract: Regeneration of planted forests of Cryptomeria japonica (sugi) and Chamaecyparis obtuse (hinoki) is the pressing importance to the forest administration in Japan. Low seed germination rate of these species, however, has hampered low-cost production of their seedlings for reforestation. The primary cause of the low germinability has been attributed to highly frequent formation of anatomically unsound seeds, which are indistinguishable from sound germinable seeds by visible observation and other common criteria such as size and weight. To establish a method for sound seed selection in these species, hyperspectral imaging technique was used to identify a wavelength range where reflectance spectra differ clearly between sound and unsound seeds. In sound seeds of both species, reflectance in a narrow waveband centered at 1,730 nm, corresponding to a lipid absorption band in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) range, was greatly depressed relative to that in adjacent wavebands on either side. Such depression was absent or less prominent in unsound seeds. Based on these observations, a reflectance index SQI, abbreviated for seed quality index, was formulated using reflectance at three narrow SWIR wavebands so that it represents the extent of the depression. SQI calculated from seed area-averaged reflectance spectra and spatial distribution patterns of pixelwise SQI within each seed area were both proven as reliable criteria for sound seed selection. Enrichment of sound seeds was accompanied by an increase in germination rate of the seed lot. Thus, the methods described are readily applicable toward low-cost seedling production in combination with single seed sowing technology.

Abstract: Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid, a potent bioactive lipid mediator, through its lysophospholipase D activity. Although five alternative splicing isoforms of ATX have been identified as ATXÎ±, ATXÎ², ATXÎ³, ATXÎ´, and ATXÎµ and the expression patterns of each isoform differ among several tissues, the clinical significance of each isoform remains to be elucidated.

Abstract: The majority (>95%) of new HIV infection occurs in resource-limited settings, and Cameroon is still experiencing a generalized epidemic with ~122,638 patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). A detrimental outcome in scaling-up ART is the emergence HIV drug resistance (HIVDR), suggesting the need for pragmatic approaches in sustaining a successful ART performance.


Title #589: Processing of Feature Selectivity in Cortical Networks with Specific Connectivity.
PMID: 26083363
Authors: Sadra S. Sadeh, Claudia C. Clopath, Stefan S. Rotter
Abstract: Although non-specific at the onset of eye opening, networks in rodent visual cortex attain a non-random structure after eye opening, with a specific bias for connections between neurons of similar preferred orientations. As orientation selectivity is already present at eye opening, it remains unclear how this specificity in network wiring contributes to feature selectivity. Using large-scale inhibition-dominated spiking networks as a model, we show that feature-specific connectivity leads to a linear amplification of feedforward tuning, consistent with recent electrophysiological single-neuron recordings in rodent neocortex. Our results show that optimal amplification is achieved at an intermediate regime of specific connectivity. In this configuration a moderate increase of pairwise correlations is observed, consistent with recent experimental findings. Furthermore, we observed that feature-specific connectivity leads to the emergence of orientation-selective reverberating activity, and entails pattern completion in network responses. Our theoretical analysis provides a mechanistic understanding of subnetworks' responses to visual stimuli, and casts light on the regime of operation of sensory cortices in the presence of specific connectivity.

Title #591: Protected Area Tourism in a Changing Climate: Will Visitation at US National Parks Warm Up or Overheat?
PMID: 26083361
Authors: Nicholas A NA. Fisichelli, Gregor W GW. Schuurman, William B WB. Monahan, Pamela S PS. Ziesler
Abstract: Climate change will affect not only natural and cultural resources within protected areas but also tourism and visitation patterns. The U.S. National Park Service systematically collects data regarding its 270+ million annual recreation visits, and therefore provides an opportunity to examine how human visitation may respond to climate change from the tropics to the polar regions. To assess the relationship between climate and park visitation, we evaluated historical monthly mean air temperature and visitation data (1979-2013) at 340 parks and projected potential future visitation (2041-2060) based on two warming-climate scenarios and two visitation-growth scenarios. For the entire park system a third-order polynomial temperature model explained 69% of the variation in historical visitation trends. Visitation generally increased with increasing average monthly temperature, but decreased strongly with temperatures > 25Â°C. Linear to polynomial monthly temperature models also explained historical visitation at individual parks (R2 0.12-0.99, mean = 0.79, median = 0.87). Future visitation at almost all parks (95%) may change based on historical temperature, historical visitation, and future temperature projections. Warming-mediated increases in potential visitation are projected for most months in most parks (67-77% of months; range across future scenarios), resulting in future increases in total annual visits across the park system (8-23%) and expansion of the visitation season at individual parks (13-31 days). Although very warm months at some parks may see decreases in future visitation, this potential change represents a relatively small proportion of visitation across the national park system. A changing climate is likely to have cascading and complex effects on protected area visitation, management, and local economies. Results suggest that protected areas and neighboring communities that develop adaptation strategies for these changes may be able to both capitalize on opportunities and minimize detriment related to changing visitation.


Title #592: Intermittent cycles of remote ischemic preconditioning augment diabetic foot ulcer healing.
PMID: 26083360

Abstract: The morbidity and mortality caused by diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are still significant. Conservative treatment of DFU is often ineffective. Treatment modalities using stem cells directly into the DFU or systematically have been introduced recently. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been proved to be a cheap, simple, and safe method which can augment stem cells number in the peripheral blood circulation. This study's purpose was to test whether IPC can improve DFU healing. Forty diabetic patients were enrolled and divided into study and control groups. All patients received their regular treatment. The study group patients received in addition brief, transient cycles of IPC while the control group patients received a sham procedure only. The procedure was repeated every 2 weeks to complete a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The ulcers were photographed to measure wound area, and the degree of granulation tissue was assessed. No serious adverse events were noted. Twenty-two patients from the study group and 12 from the control group completed the entire follow-up. The ratio of patients who reached complete healing of their ulcer was 9/22 (41%) in the study group compared with 0/12 (0%) in the control group, pâ=â0.01. Furthermore, the mean remaining ulcer area at the end of the follow-up was significantly smaller in the study group, 25âÂ±â6% of the initial area vs. 61âÂ±â10% in the control group, pâ=â0.007. The degree of granulation increased after one cycle of treatment in 8/24 (33%) study patients compared to 3/16 (19%) in the control group, pâ=â0.47. Remote, repeated IPC significantly improves the healing of DFU. This simple, safe, inexpensive treatment method should be considered to be routinely applied to diabetic patients with DFU in addition to other regular treatment modalities.

PMID: 26083359
Authors: H. H. Handrkova, V. V. Schroeder, H P HP. Kohler
Abstract: The activation peptide of human factor XIII (AP-FXIII) comprises the first 37 amino acids of the N-terminus and holds the FXIII in an inactive state. FXIII is activated either proteolytically by cleavage of AP-FXIII by thrombin, or nonproteolytically by high calcium concentrations.


Title #594: The preclinical discovery of rituximab for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
PMID: 26083358
Authors: Piotr P. Smolewski, Tadeusz T. Robak
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were developed in the 1980s in order to treat malignancies. An important target for MoAbs was the CD20 B-cell lineage antigen. Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric mouse anti-human MoAb that targets the CD20 antigen on the surface of malignant and normal B lymphocytes, and has rapidly become the widest used immunotherapeutic drug. RTX has had a significant impact on how B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia is now treated. Areas covered: In this review, the authors demonstrate the mechanisms of action of RTX, and the preclinical data that have led to clinical trials and its final approval for the treatment of B-cell NHLs. Expert opinion: The discovery of RTX opened a new era for treatment of B-cell malignancies and became the starting point for the development of new, more active classes of anti-CD20 agents. Furthermore, it has contributed to the construction of a number of MoAbs specific for other antigens that target different types of neoplastic cells.


Title #595: Orthogonal Cherenkov sound in spin-orbit coupled systems.
PMID: 26083355
Authors: Sergey S. Smirnov
Abstract: Conventionally the Cherenkov sound is governed by orbital degrees of freedom and is excited by supersonic particles. Additionally, it usually has a forward nature with a conic geometry known as the Cherenkov cone whose axis is oriented along the supersonic particle motion. Here we predict Cherenkov sound of a unique nature entirely resulting from the electronic spin degree of freedom and demonstrate a fundamentally distinct Cherenkov effect originating from essentially subsonic electrons in two-dimensional gases with both Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Specifically, we show that the axis of the conventional forward Cherenkov cone gets a nontrivial quarter-turn and at the same time the sound distribution strongly localizes around this rotated axis being now orthogonal to the subsonic particle motion. Apart from its fundamentally appealing nature, the orthogonal Cherenkov sound could have applications in planar semiconductor technology combining spin and acoustic phenomena to develop, e.g., acoustic amplifiers or sound sources with a flexible spin dependent orientation of the sound propagation.

Title #597: Phylogeographic Structure in Penguin Ticks across an Ocean Basin Indicates Allopatric Divergence and Rare Trans-Oceanic Dispersal.
PMID: 26083353
Authors: Katherine L KL. Moon, Sam C SC. Banks, Ceridwen I CI. Fraser
Abstract: The association of ticks (Acarina) and seabirds provides an intriguing system for assessing the influence of long-distance dispersal on the evolution of parasitic species. Recent research has focused on host-parasite evolutionary relationships and dispersal capacity of ticks parasitising flighted seabirds. Evolutionary research on the ticks of non-flighted seabirds is, in contrast, scarce. We conducted the first phylogeographic investigation of a hard tick species (Ixodes eudyptidis) that parasitises the Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor). Using one nuclear (28S) and two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) markers, we assessed genetic diversity among several populations in Australia and a single population on the South Island of New Zealand. Our results reveal two deeply divergent lineages, possibly representing different species: one comprising all New Zealand samples and some from Australia, and the other representing all other samples from Australian sites. No significant population differentiation was observed among any Australian sites from within each major clade, even those separated by hundreds of kilometres of coastline. In contrast, the New Zealand population was significantly different to all samples from Australia. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the New Zealand and Australian populations are effectively isolated from each other; although rare long-distance dispersal events must occur, these are insufficient to maintain trans-Tasman gene flow. Despite the evidence for limited dispersal of penguin ticks between Australia and New Zealand, we found no evidence to suggest that ticks are unable to disperse shorter distances at sea with their hosts, with no pattern of population differentiation found among Australian sites. Our results suggest that terrestrial seabird parasites may be quite capable of short-distance movements, but only sporadic longer-distance (trans-oceanic) dispersal.


Title #598: Eupatilin Exerts Antinociceptive and Chondroprotective Properties in a Rat Model of Osteoarthritis by Downregulating Oxidative Damage and Catabolic Activity in Chondrocytes.
PMID: 26083352

Abstract: Increases in oxidative stress are thought to be associated with the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Eupatilin, one of the major compounds present in artemisia species, was shown to have both anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we investigated the in vivo effects of eupatilin on pain severity and cartilage degradation in an experimental rat model of OA, along with the mechanisms of action underlying these effects. Experimental OA was induced via an intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA), with oral administration of eupatilin initiated on the day of MIA injection. Pain was assessed by measuring the paw withdrawal latency and threshold. Cartilage destruction was analyzed macroscopically and histomorphologically. The effects of eupatilin on mRNA expression were investigated in interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²)-stimulated human OA chondrocytes. Eupatilin treatment exhibited clear antinociceptive effects, along with an attenuation of cartilage degradation in OA rats. Additionally, the number of osteoclasts present in the subchondral bone region was significantly decreased following eupatilin treatment. Eupatilin reduced the expression of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitrotyrosine and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cartilage. mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP13, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5 (ADAMTS-5) were reduced in IL-1Î²-stimulated human OA chondrocytes, while tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) was induced. Phosphorylated protein levels of the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was reduced by eupatilin. Taken together, these results suggest that eupatilin suppresses oxidative damage and reciprocally enhances extracellular matrix production in articular chondrocytes, making eupatilin a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of OA.


Title #599: Assessing the Sulfide Footprint of Mussel Farms with Sediment Profile Imagery: A New Zealand Trial.
PMID: 26083351
Authors: Peter S PS. Wilson, Kay K. Vopel
Abstract: Growing numbers and increased stocking of marine mussel farms make reliable techniques for environmental effect assessment a priority. Previously, we showed how the color intensity of soft sediment could be used to estimate its acid volatile sulfide (AVS) content, a product of the anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter deposits. We then proposed to include assessments of the AVS farm footprint in marine farm monitoring, in particular, to investigate temporal changes in the extent of the seafloor area of elevated sediment AVS content. Such assessment requires accurate detection of the AVS footprint boundary. Here, we demonstrate how to detect this boundary with analyses of sediment color intensity. We analyzed 182 sediment profile images taken along three transects leading from approximately 50 m inside to 200 m outside a long-line mussel farm in New Zealand and found that the mean sediment color intensity inside the farm boundary was almost one third lower than that of the sediment distant from the farm. Segmented regression analysis of the combined color intensity data revealed a breakpoint in the trend of increasing grey values with increasing distance from the farm at 56 Â± 13 m (Â± 95% confidence interval of the breakpoint) outside the mussel farm. Statistical analyses indicated that the extent of the color intensity footprint was a function of water column depth, as was shown visually using mapping methods; organic particles disperse further in a deeper seawater column. We conclude that for soft coastal sediments, our sampling and data analysis techniques may provide a rapid and reliable supplement to existing benthic surveys that assess environmental effects of mussel farms.


Title #600: Biophysical Insights into How Spike Threshold Depends on the Rate of Membrane Potential Depolarization in Type I and Type II Neurons.
PMID: 26083350
Authors: Guo-Sheng GS. Yi, Jiang J. Wang, Kai-Ming KM. Tsang, Xi-Le XL. Wei, Bin B. Deng
Abstract: Dynamic spike threshold plays a critical role in neuronal input-output relations. In many neurons, the threshold potential depends on the rate of membrane potential depolarization (dV/dt) preceding a spike. There are two basic classes of neural excitability, i.e., Type I and Type II, according to input-output properties. Although the dynamical and biophysical basis of their spike initiation has been established, the spike threshold dynamic for each cell type has not been well described. Here, we use a biophysical model to investigate how spike threshold depends on dV/dt in two types of neuron. It is observed that Type II spike threshold is more depolarized and more sensitive to dV/dt than Type I. With phase plane analysis, we show that each threshold dynamic arises from the different separatrix and K+ current kinetics. By analyzing subthreshold properties of membrane currents, we find the activation of hyperpolarizing current prior to spike initiation is a major factor that regulates the threshold dynamics. The outward K+ current in Type I neuron does not activate at the perithresholds, which makes its spike threshold insensitive to dV/dt. The Type II K+ current activates prior to spike initiation and there is a large net hyperpolarizing current at the perithresholds, which results in a depolarized threshold as well as a pronounced threshold dynamic. These predictions are further attested in several other functionally equivalent cases of neural excitability. Our study provides a fundamental description about how intrinsic biophysical properties contribute to the threshold dynamics in Type I and Type II neurons, which could decipher their significant functions in neural coding.


Title #601: Rapid Response to Evaluate the Presence of Amphibian Chytrid Fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and Ranavirus in Wild Amphibian Populations in Madagascar.
PMID: 26083349

Abstract: We performed a rapid response investigation to evaluate the presence and distribution of amphibian pathogens in Madagascar following our identification of amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd) and ranavirus in commercially exported amphibians. This targeted risk-based field surveillance program was conducted from February to April 2014 encompassing 12 regions and 47 survey sites. We simultaneously collected amphibian and environmental samples to increase survey sensitivity and performed sampling both in wilderness areas and commercial amphibian trade facilities. Bd was not detected in any of 508 amphibian skin swabs or 68 water filter samples, suggesting pathogen prevalence was below 0.8%, with 95% confidence during our visit. Ranavirus was detected in 5 of 97 amphibians, including one adult Mantidactylus cowanii and three unidentified larvae from Ranomafana National Park, and one adult Mantidactylus mocquardi from Ankaratra. Ranavirus was also detected in water samples collected from two commercial amphibian export facilities. We also provide the first report of an amphibian mass-mortality event observed in wild amphibians in Madagascar. Although neither Bd nor ranavirus appeared widespread in Madagascar during this investigation, additional health surveys are required to disentangle potential seasonal variations in pathogen abundance and detectability from actual changes in pathogen distribution and rates of spread. Accordingly, our results should be conservatively interpreted until a comparable survey effort during winter months has been performed. It is imperative that biosecurity practices be immediately adopted to limit the unintentional increased spread of disease through the movement of contaminated equipment or direct disposal of contaminated material from wildlife trade facilities. The presence of potentially introduced strains of ranaviruses suggests that Madagascar's reptile species might also be threatened by disease. Standardized population monitoring of key amphibian and reptile species should be established with urgency to enable early detection of potential impacts of disease emergence in this global biodiversity hotspot.

Abstract: Control and elimination of malaria still represents a major public health challenge. Emerging parasite resistance to current therapies urges development of antimalarials with novel mechanism of action. Phospholipid biosynthesis of the Plasmodium parasite has been validated as promising candidate antimalarial target. The most prevalent de novo pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is the Kennedy pathway. Its regulatory and often also rate limiting step is catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). The CHO-MT58 cell line expresses a mutant variant of CCT, and displays a thermo-sensitive phenotype. At non-permissive temperature (40Â°C), the endogenous CCT activity decreases dramatically, blocking membrane synthesis and ultimately leading to apoptosis. In the present study we investigated the impact of the analogous mutation in a catalytic domain construct of Plasmodium falciparum CCT in order to explore the underlying molecular mechanism that explains this phenotype. We used temperature dependent enzyme activity measurements and modeling to investigate the functionality of the mutant enzyme. Furthermore, MS measurements were performed to determine the oligomerization state of the protein, and MD simulations to assess the inter-subunit interactions in the dimer. Our results demonstrate that the R681H mutation does not directly influence enzyme catalytic activity. Instead, it provokes increased heat-sensitivity by destabilizing the CCT dimer. This can possibly explain the significance of the PfCCT pseudoheterodimer organization in ensuring proper enzymatic function. This also provide an explanation for the observed thermo-sensitive phenotype of CHO-MT58 cell line.


Title #604: Virulence Factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Induce Both the Unfolded Protein and Integrated Stress Responses in Airway Epithelial Cells.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection can be disastrous in chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Its toxic effects are largely mediated by secreted virulence factors including pyocyanin, elastase and alkaline protease (AprA). Efficient functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for cell survival and appropriate immune responses, while an excess of unfolded proteins within the ER leads to "ER stress" and activation of the "unfolded protein response" (UPR). Bacterial infection and Toll-like receptor activation trigger the UPR most likely due to the increased demand for protein folding of inflammatory mediators. In this study, we show that cell-free conditioned medium of the PAO1 strain of P. aeruginosa, containing secreted virulence factors, induces ER stress in primary bronchial epithelial cells as evidenced by splicing of XBP1 mRNA and induction of CHOP, GRP78 and GADD34 expression. Most aspects of the ER stress response were dependent on TAK1 and p38 MAPK, except for the induction of GADD34 mRNA. Using various mutant strains and purified virulence factors, we identified pyocyanin and AprA as inducers of ER stress. However, the induction of GADD34 was mediated by an ER stress-independent integrated stress response (ISR) which was at least partly dependent on the iron-sensing eIF2Î± kinase HRI. Our data strongly suggest that this increased GADD34 expression served to protect against Pseudomonas-induced, iron-sensitive cell cytotoxicity. In summary, virulence factors from P. aeruginosa induce ER stress in airway epithelial cells and also trigger the ISR to improve cell survival of the host.

Abstract: The most active anticancer component in green tea is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Protein interaction with EGCG is a critical step for mediating the effects of EGCG on the regulation of various key molecules involved in signal transduction. By using computational docking screening methods for protein identification, we identified a serine/threonine kinase, 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK2), as a novel molecular target of EGCG. RSK2 includes two kinase catalytic domains in the N-terminal (NTD) and the C-terminal (CTD) and RSK2 full activation requires phosphorylation of both terminals. The computer prediction was confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay in which EGCG inhibited RSK2 activity in a dose-dependent manner. Pull-down assay results showed that EGCG could bind with RSK2 at both kinase catalytic domains in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, results of an ATP competition assay and a computer-docking model showed that EGCG binds with RSK2 in an ATP-dependent manner. In RSK2+/+ and RSK2-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts, EGCG decreased viability only in the presence of RSK2. EGCG also suppressed epidermal growth factor-induced neoplastic cell transformation by inhibiting phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10. Overall, these results indicate that RSK2 is a novel molecular target of EGCG.


Title #607: Rapid Immunochromatographic Detection of Serum Anti-Î±-Galactosidase A Antibodies in Fabry Patients after Enzyme Replacement Therapy.

Abstract: We developed an immunochromatography-based assay for detecting antibodies against recombinant Î±-galactosidase A proteins in serum. The evaluation of 29 serum samples from Fabry patients, who had received enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha and/or agalsidase beta, was performed by means of this assay method, and the results clearly revealed that the patients exhibited the same level of antibodies against both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta, regardless of the species of recombinant Î±-galactosidase A used for enzyme replacement therapy. A conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay supported the results. Considering these, enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta would generate antibodies against the common epitopes in both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta. Most of the patients who showed immunopositive reaction exhibited classic Fabry phenotype and harbored gene mutations affecting biosynthesis of Î±-galactosidase A. As immunochromatography is a handy and simple assay system which can be available at bedside, this assay method would be extremely useful for quick evaluation or first screening of serum antibodies against agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta in Fabry disease with enzyme replacement therapy.


Title #608: Access to CD4 Testing for Rural HIV Patients: Findings from a Cohort Study in Zimbabwe.

Abstract: CD4 cell count measurement remains an important diagnostic tool for HIV care in developing countries. Insufficient laboratory capacity in rural Sub-Saharan Africa is frequently mentioned but data on the impact at an individual patient level are lacking. Urban-rural discrepancies in CD4 testing have not been quantified to date. Such evidence is crucial for public health planning and to justify new yet more expensive diagnostic procedures that could circumvent access constraints in rural areas.


Title #609: A Neural Network Model for K(Î») Retrieval and Application to Global Kpar Monitoring.
PMID: 26083341
Authors: Jun J. Chen, Yuanli Y. Zhu, Yongsheng Y. Wu, Tingwei T. Cui, Joji J. Ishizaka, Yongtao Y. Ju
Abstract: Accurate estimation of diffuse attenuation coefficients in the visible wavelengths Kd(Î») from remotely sensed data is particularly challenging in global oceanic and coastal waters. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the applicability of a semi-analytical Kd(Î») retrieval model (SAKM) and Jamet's neural network model (JNNM), and then develop a new neural network Kd(Î») retrieval model (NNKM). Based on the comparison of Kd(Î») predicted by these models with in situ measurements taken from the global oceanic and coastal waters, all of the NNKM, SAKM, and JNNM models work well in Kd(Î») retrievals, but the NNKM model works more stable and accurate than both SAKM and JNNM models. The near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined model is used to remove the atmospheric effects on MODIS data. The Kd(Î») data was determined from the atmospheric corrected MODIS data using the NNKM, JNNM, and SAKM models. The results show that the NNKM model produces <30% uncertainty in deriving Kd(Î») from global oceanic and coastal waters, which is 4.88-17.18% more accurate than SAKM and JNNM models. Furthermore, we employ an empirical approach to calculate Kpar from the NNKM model-derived diffuse attenuation coefficient at visible bands (443, 488, 555, and 667 nm). The results show that our model presents a satisfactory performance in deriving Kpar from the global oceanic and coastal waters with 20.2% uncertainty. The Kpar are quantified from MODIS data atmospheric correction using our model. Comparing with field measurements, our model produces ~31.0% uncertainty in deriving Kpar from Bohai Sea. Finally, the applicability of our model for general oceanographic studies is briefly illuminated by applying it to climatological monthly mean remote sensing reflectance for time ranging from July, 2002- July 2014 at the global scale. The results indicate that the high Kd(Î») and Kpar values are usually found around the coastal zones in the high latitude regions, while low Kd(Î») and Kpar values are usually found in the open oceans around the low-latitude regions. These results could improve our knowledge about the light field under waters at either the global or basin scales, and be potentially used into general circulation models to estimate the heat flux between atmosphere and ocean.


Title #610: Reinforcing the LINC Complex Connection to Actin Filaments: The Role of FHOD1 In TAN Line Formation and Nuclear Movement.
PMID: 26083340
Authors: Susumu S. Antoku, Ruijun R. Zhu, Stefan S. Kutscheidt, Oliver T OT. Fackler, Gregg G GG. Gundersen
Abstract: Positioning the nucleus is critical for many cellular processes including cell division, migration and differentiation. The linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex spans the inner and outer nuclear membranes and has emerged as a major factor in connecting the nucleus to the cytoskeleton for movement and positioning. Recently, we discovered that the diaphanous formin family member FHOD1 interacts with the LINC complex component nesprin-2 giant (nesprin-2G) and that this interaction plays essential roles in the formation of transmembrane actin-dependent nuclear (TAN) lines and nuclear movement during cell polarization in fibroblasts. We found that FHOD1 strengthens the connection between nesprin-2G and rearward moving dorsal actin cables by providing a second site of interaction between nesprin-2G and the actin cable. These results indicate that the LINC complex connection to the actin cytoskeleton can be enhanced by cytoplasmic factors and suggest a new model for TAN line formation. We discuss how the nesprin-2G-FHOD1 interaction may be regulated and its possible functional significance for development and disease.


Title #611: Cross Talk between KGF and KITLG Proteins Implicated with Ovarian Folliculogenesis in Buffalo Bubalus bubalis.
PMID: 26083339
Authors: Deepak D. Panwar, Leena L. Rawal, Neeta N. Sehgal, Sher S. Ali
Abstract: Molecular interactions between mesenchymal-derived Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and Kit ligand (KITLG) are essential for follicular development. These factors are expressed by theca and granulosa cells. We determined full length coding sequence of buffalo KGF and KITLG proteins having 194 and 274 amino acids, respectively. The recombinant KGF and KITLG proteins were solubilized in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and purified using Ni-NTA column and GST affinity chromatography, respectively. The purity and molecular weight of His-KGF (~23 kDa) and GST-KITLG (~57 kDa) proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The co-immunoprecipitation assay accompanied with computational analysis demonstrated the interaction between KGF and KITLG proteins. We deduced 3D structures of the candidate proteins and assessed their binding based on protein docking. In the process, KGF specific residues, Lys123, Glu135, Lys140, Lys155 and Trp156 and KITLG specific ones, Ser226, Phe233, Gly234, Ala235, Phe236, Trp238 and Lys239 involved in the formation of KGF-KITLG complex were detected. The hydrophobic interactions surrounding KGF-KITLG complex affirmed their binding affinity and stability to the interacting interface. Additionally, in-silico site directed mutagenesis enabled the assessment of changes that occurred in the binding energies of mutated KGF-KITLG protein complex. Our results demonstrate that in the presence of KITLG, KGF mimics its native binding mode suggesting all the KGF residues are specific to their binding complex. This study provides an insight on the critical amino acid residues participating in buffalo ovarian folliculogenesis.

Abstract: Canadian pediatric emergency department visits are increasing, with a disproportionate increase in low-acuity visits locally (33% of volume in 2008-09, 41% in 2011-12). We sought to understand: 1) presentation patterns and resource implications; 2) parents' perceptions and motivations; and 3) alternate health care options considered prior to presenting with low-acuity problems.


Title #613: Olfactory Orientation and Navigation in Humans.
PMID: 26083337
Authors: Lucia F LF. Jacobs, Jennifer J. Arter, Amy A. Cook, Frank J FJ. Sulloway
Abstract: Although predicted by theory, there is no direct evidence that an animal can define an arbitrary location in space as a coordinate location on an odor grid. Here we show that humans can do so. Using a spatial match-to-sample procedure, humans were led to a random location within a room diffused with two odors. After brief sampling and spatial disorientation, they had to return to this location. Over three conditions, participants had access to different sensory stimuli: olfactory only, visual only, and a final control condition with no olfactory, visual, or auditory stimuli. Humans located the target with higher accuracy in the olfaction-only condition than in the control condition and showed higher accuracy than chance. Thus a mechanism long proposed for the homing pigeon, the ability to define a location on a map constructed from chemical stimuli, may also be a navigational mechanism used by humans.


Title #614: Computational Fact Checking from Knowledge Networks.
PMID: 26083336
Authors: Giovanni Luca GL. Ciampaglia, Prashant P. Shiralkar, Luis M LM. Rocha, Johan J. Bollen, Filippo F. Menczer, Alessandro A. Flammini
Abstract: Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up with the enormous volume of information that is now generated online. Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.


Title #615: Which Colposcopies Should Include Endocervical Curettage?
PMID: 26083335
Authors: Robert G RG. Pretorius, Jerome L JL. Belinson, Patricia P. Peterson, Raoul J RJ. Burchette
Abstract: Although endocervical curettage (ECC) is often performed at colposcopy, it remains unclear whether it should be done in all women, only women over a certain age, only women with unsatisfactory colposcopy, or only in women with normal colposcopic impressions. To clarify the indications for ECC, we determined the proportion of colposcopies with CIN 3, or cancer (CIN 3+) detected only by ECC showing CIN 2, CIN 3, or cancer (CIN 2+).

Abstract: Performing endocervical curettage (ECC) at colposcopy may increase the yield of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or worse (CIN2+) compared to biopsies alone. The additional benefit of ECC in detecting CIN2+ was studied in women with lesion-targeted biopsies (low-grade or worse impression) and women with biopsies of normal-appearing cervix (less than low-grade impression).

Morrish, Eugenie E. Pedagogos, Vlado V. Perkovic, Donna D. Reidlinger, Anish A. Scaria, Rowan R. Walker, Liza A LA. Vergara, Carmel M CM. Hawley, David W DW. Johnson, 
Abstract: Objective Pentoxifylline has previously been shown to increase haemoglobin levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA)-hyporesponsive anaemia in the HERO multi-centre double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The present study evaluated the effects of pentoxifylline on oxidative stress in ESA-hyporesponsive CKD patients. Methods This sub-study of the HERO trial compared 15 patients in the pentoxifylline arm (400Â mg daily) and 17 in the matched placebo arm on oxidative stress markers: plasma total F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Results Pentoxifylline did not significantly alter total F2-isoprostanes (adjusted mean difference (MD) 35.01Â pg/ml, PÂ =Â 0.108), SOD activity (MD 0.82Â U/ml, PÂ =Â 0.073), GPX activity (MD -6.06Â U/l, PÂ =Â 0.085), or protein carbonyls (MD -0.04Â nmol/mg, PÂ =Â 0.523). Replicating results from the main study, pentoxifylline significantly increased haemoglobin concentration compared with controls (MD 7.2Â g/l, PÂ =Â 0.04). Conclusions Pentoxifylline did not alter oxidative stress biomarkers, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the agent's ability to augment haemoglobin levels in CKD patients with ESA-hyporesponsive anaemia.

Title #623: An extended analytical approach for diffuse optical imaging.
PMID: 26083326
Authors: H. H. Erkol, F. F. Nouizi, M B MB. Unlu, G. G. Gulsen
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an analytical method to solve the diffusion equation in a cylindrical geometry. This method is based on an integral approach to derive the Green's function for specific boundary conditions. Using our approach, we obtain comprehensive analytical solutions with the Robin boundary condition for diffuse optical imaging in both two and three dimensions. The solutions are expressed in terms of the optical properties of tissue and the amplitude and position of the light source. Our method not only works well inside the tissue but provides very accurate results near the tissue boundaries as well. The results obtained by our method are first compared with those obtained by a conventional analytical method then validated using numerical simulations. Our new analytical method allows not only implementation of any boundary condition for a specific problem but also fast simulation of light propagation making it very suitable for iterative image reconstruction algorithms.


Title #624: Cinnamamide Derivatives for Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders-A Review of Structure-Activity Relationships.
PMID: 26083325
Authors: Agnieszka A. Gunia-KrzyÅ¼ak, Katarzyna K. PaÅczyk, Anna M AM. Waszkielewicz, Henryk H. Marona
Abstract: The cinnamamide scaffold has been incorporated in to the structure of numerous organic compounds with therapeutic potential. The scaffold enables multiple interactions, such as hydrophobic, dipolar, and hydrogen bonding, with important molecular targets. Additionally, the scaffold has multiple substitution options providing the opportunity to optimize and modify the pharmacological activity of the derivatives. In particular, cinnamamide derivatives have exhibited therapeutic potential in animal models of both central and peripheral nervous system disorders. Some have undergone clinical trials and were introduced on to the pharmaceutical market. The diverse activities observed in the nervous system included anticonvulsant, antidepressant, neuroprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Over the last decade, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of action of these derivatives, and the data reported in the literature include targeting the Î³-aminobutyric acid typeâA (GABAA ) receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels, voltage-gated potassium channels, histone deacetylases (HDACs), prostanoid receptors, opioid receptors, and histamine H3 receptors. Here, the literature data from reports evaluating cinnamic acid amide derivatives for activity in target-based or phenotypic assays, both in vivo and in vitro, relevant to disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems are analyzed and structure-activity relationships discussed.


Title #625: Self-Replenishable Anti-Waxing Organogel Materials.
PMID: 26083324
Authors: Xi X. Yao, Shuwang S. Wu, Lie L. Chen, Jie J. Ju, Zhandong Z. Gu, Mingjie M. Liu, Jianjun J. Wang, Lei L. Jiang
Abstract: Solid deposition, such as the formation of ice on outdoor facilities, the deposition of scale in water reservoirs, the sedimentation of fat, oil, and grease (FOG) in sewer systems, and the precipitation of wax in petroleum pipelines, cause a serious waste of resources and irreversible environmental pollution. Inspired by fish and pitcher plants, we present a self-replenishable organogel material which shows ultra-low adhesion to solidified paraffin wax and crude oil by absorption of low-molar-mass oil from its crude-oil environment. Adhesion of wax on the organogel surface was over 500 times lower than adhesion to conventional material surfaces and the wax was found to slide off under the force of gravity. This design concept of a gel with decreased adhesion to wax and oil can be extended to deal with other solid deposition problems.


Title #626: ATG16L1 phosphorylation is oppositely regulated by CSNK2/casein kinase 2 and PPP1/protein phosphatase 1 which determines the fate of cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ULK1 and ATG13 are related to autophagy activity. Although ATG16L1 is absolutely required for autophagy induction by affecting the formation of autophagosomes, the posttranslational modification of ATG16L1 remains elusive. Here, we explored the regulatory mechanism and role of ATG16L1 phosphorylation for autophagy induction in cardiomyocytes. We showed that ATG16L1 was a phosphoprotein, because phosphorylation of ATG16L1 was detected in rat cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). We not only demonstrated that CSNK2 (casein kinase 2) phosphorylated ATG16L1, but also identified the highly conserved Ser139 as the critical phosphorylation residue for CSNK2. We further established that ATG16L1 associated with the ATG12-ATG5 complex in a Ser139 phosphorylation-dependent manner. In agreement with this finding, CSNK2 inhibitor disrupted the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex. Importantly, phosphorylation of ATG16L1 on Ser139 was responsible for H/R-induced autophagy in cardiomyocytes, which protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. Conversely, we determined that wild-type PPP1 (protein phosphatase 1), but not the inactive mutant, associated with ATG16L1, and antagonized CSNK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATG16L1. Interestingly, one RVxF consensus site for PPP1 binding in the C-terminal tail of ATG16L1 was identified; mutation of this site disrupted its association with ATG16L1. Notably, CSNK2 also associated with PPP1, but ATG16L1 depletion impaired the interaction between CSNK2 and PPP1. Collectively, these data identify ATG16L1 as a bona fide physiological CSNK2 and PPP1 substrate, which reveals a novel molecular link from CSNK2 to activation of the autophagy-specific ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex and autophagy induction.


Title #627: The origin of high thermal conductivity and ultra-low thermal expansion in copper-graphite composites.
PMID: 26083322
Authors: Izabela I. Firkowska, AndrÃ© A. Boden, Benji B. Boerner, Stephanie S. Reich
Abstract: We developed a nanocomposite with highly aligned graphite platelets in a copper matrix. Spark plasma sintering ensured an excellent copper-graphite interface for transmitting heat and stress. The resulting composite has superior thermal conductivity (500Wm(-1)K(-1), 140% of copper) in excellent agreement with modeling based on the effective medium approximation. The thermal expansion perpendicular to the graphite platelets drops dramatically from ~20ppmK(-1) for graphite and copper separately to 2ppmK(-1) for the combined structure. We show that this originates from the layered, highly anisotropic structure of graphite combined with residual stress under ambient conditions, i.e., strain-engineering of the thermal expansion. Combining excellent thermal conductivity with ultra-low thermal expansion results in ideal materials for heat sinks and other devices for thermal management.


Title #628: Resonance Character of Copper/Silver/Gold Bonding in Small MoleculeâââMï£¿X (X=F, Cl, Br, CH3 , CF3 ) Complexes.
PMID: 26083320
Authors: Guiqiu G. Zhang, Huanjing H. Yue, Frank F. Weinhold, Hui H. Wang, Hong H. Li, Dezhan D. Chen
Abstract: The resonance character of Cu/Ag/Au bonding is investigated in BâââMï£¿X (M=Cu, Ag, Au; X=F, Cl, Br, CH3 , CF3 ; B=CO, H2 O, H2 S, C2 H2 , C2 H4 ) complexes. The natural bond orbital/natural resonance theory results strongly support the general resonance-type three-center/four-electron (3c/4e) picture of Cu/Ag/Au bonding, B:Mï£¿XâB(+) ï£¿M:X(-) , which mainly arises from hyperconjugation interactions. On the basis of such resonance-type bonding mechanisms, the ligand effects in the more strongly bound OCâââMï£¿X series are analyzed, and distinct competition between CO and the axial ligand X is observed. This competitive bonding picture directly explains why CO in OCâââAuï£¿CF3 can be readily replaced by a number of other ligands. Additionally, conservation of the bond order indicates that the idealized relationship bBâââM +bMX =1 should be suitably generalized for intermolecular bonding, especially if there is additional partial multiple bonding at one end of the 3c/4e hyperbonded triad.


Title #629: Overview on Sobemoviruses and a Proposal for the Creation of the Family Sobemoviridae.
PMID: 26083319
Authors: Merike M. SÃµmera, Cecilia C. Sarmiento, Erkki E. Truve
Abstract: The genus Sobemovirus, unassigned to any family, consists of viruses with single-stranded plus-oriented single-component RNA genomes and small icosahedral particles. Currently, 14 species within the genus have been recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) but several new species are to be recognized in the near future. Sobemovirus genomes are compact with a conserved structure of open reading frames and with short untranslated regions. Several sobemoviruses are important pathogens. Moreover, over the last decade sobemoviruses have become important model systems to study plant virus evolution. In the current review we give an overview of the structure and expression of sobemovirus genomes, processing and functions of individual proteins, particle structure, pathology and phylogenesis of sobemoviruses as well as of satellite RNAs present together with these viruses. Based on a phylogenetic analysis we propose that a new family Sobemoviridae should be recognized including the genera Sobemovirus and Polemovirus. Finally, we outline the future perspectives and needs for the research focusing on sobemoviruses.


Title #630: Treatment of dyskeratosis congenita-associated pulmonary fibrosis with danazol.
PMID: 26083318
Authors: Bozana B. Zlateska, Amanda A. Ciccolini, Yigal Y. Dror
Abstract: Individuals with Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) are at increased risk for complications in variety of systems including pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic and DC-associated pulmonary fibrosis are progressive and fatal disorders without known treatment. Here we describe, for the first time, marked improvement in the clinical and laboratory parameters of the pulmonary disease of a child who suffered from TINF2-associated DC and severe pulmonary fibrosis after initiation of therapy with Danazol. We recommend that the clinical efficacy of Danazol in slowing down the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with telomere-related disorders is evaluated in prospective studies.

Title #631: Cytotoxic and immunogenic mechanisms of recombinant oncolytic poliovirus.
PMID: 26083317
Authors: Michael C MC. Brown, Matthias M. Gromeier
Abstract: An oncolytic virus (OV) based on poliovirus (PV), the highly attenuated polio/rhinovirus recombinant PVSRIPO, may deliver targeted inflammatory cancer cell killing; a principle that is showing promise in clinical trials for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The two decisive factors in PVSRIPO anti-tumor efficacy are selective cytotoxicity and its in situ immunogenic imprint. While our work is focused on what constitutes PVSRIPO cancer cytotoxicity, we are also studying how this engenders host immune responses that are vital to tumor regression. We hypothesize that PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are inextricably linked in essential, complimentary roles that define the anti-neoplastic response. Herein we delineate mechanisms we unraveled to decipher the basis for PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and its immunotherapeutic potential.

Abstract: Humanized mice are valuable models for the research and development of vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to control or eradicate HIV. The BLT humanized mouse model is particularly promising because the combination of transplantation of human fetal pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells with surgical engraftment of human fetal thymic tissue results in improved T cell reconstitution, maturation, and selection. To date, the BLT humanized mouse model has been used to study many aspects of HIV infection including prevention, mucosal transmission, HIV-specific innate and adaptive immunity, viral latency, and novel antiretroviral and immune-based therapies for suppression and reservoir eradication. Here we describe recent advances and applications of the BLT humanized mouse model of HIV infection and discuss opportunities to further improve this valuable small animal model.

Abstract: Zeolitic imidazolate framework-93 (ZIF-93) continuous membranes were synthesized on the inner side of P84 co-polyimide hollow fiber supports by microfluidics. MOFs and polymers showed high compatibility and the membrane exhibited H2-CH4 and CO2-CH4 separation selectivities of 97 (100 Â°C) and 17 (35 Â°C), respectively.


Title #634: Imitative flexibility and the development of cultural learning.
PMID: 26083314
Authors: Cristine H CH. Legare, Nicole J NJ. Wen, Patricia A PA. Herrmann, Harvey H. Whitehouse
Abstract: Two studies test the hypothesis that imitative fidelity is influenced by cues to interpret behavior as instrumental versus conventional. Study 1 (N=57, 4-5-yr-olds) manipulated non-verbal cues (start- and end-states of action sequences) and Study 2 (N=211, 4-6-yr-olds) manipulated verbal cues to examine the effects of information about instrumental versus conventional goals on imitative fidelity. Imitative fidelity was highest (Studies 1 and 2), innovation was lowest (Study 1), and difference detection was more accurate (Study 2) when cued with information about conventional rather than instrumental behavior. The results provide novel insight into the kinds of information children use to adjudicate between instrumental and conventional behavior.


Title #635: A Multimeric Near IR-MR Contrast Agent for Multimodal In Vivo Imaging.
PMID: 26083313
Authors: Victoria S R VS. Harrison, Christiane E CE. Carney, Keith W KW. MacRenaris, Emily A EA. Waters, Thomas J TJ. Meade
Abstract: Multiple imaging modalities are often required for in vivo imaging applications that require both high probe sensitivity and excellent spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, MR and optical imaging are an attractive combination that can be used to determine both molecular and anatomical information. Herein, we describe the synthesis and in vivo testing of two multimeric NIR-MR contrast agents that contain three Gd(III) chelates and an IR-783 dye moiety. One agent contains a PEG linker and the other a short alkyl linker. These agents label cells with extraordinary efficacy and can be detected in vivo using both imaging modalities. Biodistribution of the PEGylated agent shows observable fluorescence in xenograft MCF7 tumors and renal clearance by MR imaging.


Title #636: Serologic response after vaccination against influenza (A/H1N1)pdm09 in children with renal disease receiving oral immunosuppressive drugs.

Abstract: A limited number of reports are available regarding the effect of the influenza vaccine in pediatric patients receiving steroid and immunosuppressant therapy. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was administered to 15 children with renal disease who were receiving steroid and immunosuppressant therapy (treatment group) and 23 children with who were not receiving these drugs (non-treatment group). Titer transition of the hemagglutination inhibition antibody was compared between the 2 groups immediately before vaccination and 4 weeks and 6 months after vaccination. Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between geometric mean titer, SCR, and SPR with age, while no correlation was observed between treatment with immunosuppressant therapy and efficacy. No serious adverse reactions occurred after vaccination. This strain is not present in existing influenza vaccines, and A(H1N1)pdm09HA vaccination was administered alone in 2009. The children in this study had not previously been exposed to this strain. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the A(H1N1)pdm09HA vaccine without the effects of vaccination or past infection with A(H1N1)pdm09HA or A(H3N2) vaccination in the previous year.


Title #637: Analyzing Food-Related Life Satisfaction and other Predictors of Life Satisfaction in Central Chile.

Abstract: This study aimed to assess the effect of satisfaction with food-related life on life satisfaction among inhabitants of the main municipalities of central Chile. A survey was applied to a sample of 1,277 people, distributed proportionally by municipality. The questionnaire included the following scales: SWLS (Satisfaction with Life Scale), SWFL (Satisfaction with Food-related Life) and the Health-Related Quality of Life Index (HRQOL). Questions were asked regarding eating habits inside and outside the home, time available for meals at home, the assessment of five sources of happiness and the demographic characteristics of those surveyed. An ordered logit model was proposed, in which the dependent variable was satisfaction with life. Satisfaction with life was significantly related to the respondent's socioeconomic status, self-perception of health, degree of satisfaction with food-related life, monthly food expenditure, time available for supper with the family (p < .01); gender, self-reported number of days affected by mental health problems, frequency of supper with the family, the degree of agreement with respect to family being an important source of happiness (p < .05); and family size and frequency of food consumption in fast food outlets (p < .10). Satisfaction with life in the study sample is related to aspects associated with health, family and eating, and the family interaction associated with eating may play an important role in overall satisfaction with life.


Title #638: Highly Stable, Dual-Gated MoS2 Transistors Encapsulated by Hexagonal Boron Nitride with Gate-Controllable Contact Resistance and Threshold Voltage.
PMID: 26083310

Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have been intensively studied because of their novel properties for advanced electronics and optoelectronics. However, 2D materials are by nature sensitive to environmental influences, such as temperature, humidity, adsorbates, and trapped charges in neighboring dielectrics. Therefore, it is crucial to develop device architectures that provide both high performance and long-term stability. Here we report high performance of dual-gated van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure devices in which MoS2 layers are fully encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and contacts are formed using graphene. The hBN-encapsulation provides excellent protection from environmental factors, resulting in highly stable device performance, even at elevated temperatures. Our measurements also reveal high quality electrical contacts and reduced hysteresis, leading to high two-terminal carrier mobility (33~151 cm2/Vs) and low subthreshold swing (80 mV/dec) at room temperature. Furthermore, adjustment of graphene Fermi level and use of dual gates enable us to separately control contact resistance and threshold voltage. This novel vdW heterostructure device opens up a new way toward fabrication of stable, high performance devices based on 2D materials.

Title #640: Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis.
PMID: 26083308
Authors: Maggie M. McIlwaine, Brenda B. Button, Kerry K. Dwan
Abstract: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review.


Title #641: Familial Risks of Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorders: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
PMID: 26083307

Abstract: Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorders (CTDs), are assumed to be strongly familial and heritable. Although gene-searching efforts are well under way, precise estimates of familial risk and heritability are lacking. Previous controlled family studies were small and typically conducted within specialist clinics, resulting in potential ascertainment biases. They were also underpowered to disentangle genetic from environmental factors that contribute to the observed familiality. Twin studies have been either very small or based on parent-reported tics in population-based (nonclinical) twin samples.


Title #642: Reversible Thermal Stiffening in Polymer Nanocomposites.
PMID: 26083305
Authors: Erkan E. Senses, Andrew A. Isherwood, Pinar P. Akcora
Abstract: Miscible polymer blends with different glass transition temperatures (Tg) are known to create confined interphases between glassy and mobile chains. Here, we show that nanoparticles adsorbed with a high-Tg polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate), and dispersed in a low-Tg matrix polymer, poly(ethylene oxide), exhibit a liquid-to-solid transition at temperatures above Tg's of both polymers. The mechanical adaptivity of nanocomposites to temperature underlies the existence of dynamically asymmetric bound layers on nanoparticles, and more importantly reveals their impact on microscopic mechanical behavior of composites. The unusual reversible stiffening behavior sets these materials apart from conventional polymer composites that soften upon heating. This stiffening behavior in polymer nanocomposites can be used in applications for flexible electronics or mechanically induced actuators responding to environmental changes like temperature or magnetic fields.


Title #643: In silico investigation of PARP-1 catalytic domains in holo and apo states for the design of high-affinity PARP-1 inhibitors.
PMID: 26083304
Authors: Ramin Ekhteiari RE. Salmas, Ayhan A. Unlu, Mine M. Yurtsever, Sergei Y SY. Noskov, Serdar S. Durdagi
Abstract: The rational design of high-affinity inhibitors of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is at the heart of modern anti-cancer drug design. While relevance of enzyme to DNA repair processes in cellular environment is firmly established, the structural and functional understanding of the main determinants for high-affinity ligands controlling PARP-1 activity is still lacking. The conserved active site of PARP-1 represents an ideal target for inhibitors and may offer a novel target at the treatment of breast cancer. To fill the gap in the structural knowledge, we report on the combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), and conformational analysis that analyzes in great details novel binding mode for a number of inhibitors at the PARP-1. While optimization of the binding affinity for original target is an important goal in the drug design, many of the promising molecules for treatment of the breast cancer are plagued by significant cardiotoxicity. One of the most common side-effects reported for a number of polymerase inhibitors is its off-target interactions with cardiac ion channels and hERG1 channel, in particular. Thus, selected candidate PARP-1 inhibitors were also screened in silico at the central cavities of hERG1 potassium ion channel.


Title #644: Activation-Enabled Syntheses of Functionalized Pillar[5]arene Derivatives.
PMID: 26083303
Authors: Jie J. Han, Xisen X. Hou, Chenfeng C. Ke, Huacheng H. Zhang, Nathan L NL. Strutt, Charlotte L CL. Stern, J Fraser JF. Stoddart
Abstract: A series of regioselective di- and trifunctionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives have been synthesized by a deprotection-followed-by-activation strategy, and their constitutions have been established as a result of having access to their solid-state structures. De-O-methylation occurs in a stepwise manner at lower temperatures under kinetic control, affording the desired oligo-substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives. In addition, the regioisomers of these derivatives can be isolated by installing triflate groups on the free hydroxyl groups.

Title #646: Environmental phosphate differentially affects virulence phenotypes of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates causative of prostatitis.
PMID: 26083279
Authors: M. M. Grillo-Puertas, M G MG. MartÃ­nez-Zamora, M R MR. Rintoul, S M SM. Soto, V A VA. Rapisarda
Abstract: K-12 Escherichia coli cells grown in static media containing a critical phosphate (Pi) concentration â¥25Â mM maintained a high polyphosphate (polyP) level in stationary phase, impairing biofilm formation, a phenomenon that is triggered by polyP degradation. Pi concentration in human urine fluctuates according to health state. Here, the influence of environmental Pi concentration on the occurrence of virulence traits in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolated from acute prostatitis patients was evaluated. After a first screening, three isolates were selected according to differential biofilm formation profiles depending on media Pi concentration. For each isolate, biofilm positive and negative conditions were established. Regardless of the isolate, biofilm formation capacity was accompanied with curli and cellulose production and expression of some key virulence factors associated with adhesion. When the selected isolates were grown in their non-biofilm-forming condition, low concentrations of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin induced biofilm formation. Interestingly, similar to laboratory strains, polyP degradation induced biofilm formation in the selected isolates. Data demonstrated the complexity of UPEC responses to environmental Pi and the importance of polyP metabolism in the virulence of clinical isolates.


Title #647: Delivery of a Protease-Activated Cytolytic Peptide Prodrug by Perfluorocarbon Nanoparticles.

Abstract: Melittin is a cytolytic peptide derived from bee venom which inserts into lipid membranes and oligomerizes to form membrane pores. While this peptide is an attractive candidate for treatment of cancers and infectious processes, its nonspecific cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity have limited its therapeutic applications. Several groups have reported the development of cytolytic peptide prodrugs which only exhibit cytotoxicity following activation by site-specific proteases. However, systemic administration of these constructs has proven difficult due to their poor pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we present a platform for the design of protease-activated melittin derivatives which may be used in conjunction with a perfluorocarbon nanoparticle delivery system. While native melittin was substantially hemolytic (HD50: 1.9 ÂµM) and cytotoxic (IC50: 2.4 ÂµM), the prodrug exhibited two orders of magnitude less hemolytic activity (HD50: > 100 ÂµM) and cytotoxicity (IC50: > 100 ÂµM). Incubation with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) led to cleavage of the prodrug at the expected site and restoration of hemolytic activity (HD50: 3.4 ÂµM) and cytotoxicity (IC50: 8.1 ÂµM). Incubation of the prodrug with perfluorocarbon nanoparticles led to stable loading of 10,250 peptides per nanoparticle. Nanoparticle-bound prodrug was also cleaved and activated by MMP-9, albeit at a fourfold slower rate. Intravenous administration of prodrug-loaded nanoparticles in a mouse model of melanoma significantly decreased tumor growth rate (p = 0.01). Because MMPs and other proteases play a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, this platform holds promise for the development of personalized cancer therapies directed towards a patient's individual protease expression profile.


Title #648: Insights from the Den: How Hibernating Bears May Help Us Understand and Treat Human Disease.
PMID: 26083277
Authors: Maria M. Berg von Linde, Lilith L. ArevstrÃ¶m, Ole O. FrÃ¶bert
Abstract: Hibernating brown bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus) spend half of the year in a physically inactive state inside their winter dens without food intake and defecating and no or little urination. Under similar extreme conditions, humans would suffer from loss of lean body mass, heart failure, thrombosis, azotemia, osteoporosis, and more. However, bears exit the den in the spring strong without organ injuries. Translational animal models are used in human medicine but traditional experimental animals have several shortcomings; thus, we believe that it is time to systematically explore new models. In this review paper, we describe physiological adaptations of hibernating bears and how similar adaptations in humans could theoretically alleviate medical conditions. The bear has solved most of the health challenges faced by humans, including heart and kidney disease, atherosclerosis and thrombosis, and muscle wasting and osteoporosis. Understanding and applying this library of information could lead to a number of major discoveries that could have implications for the understanding and treatment of human disease.

Title #649: microRNA Expression Profiling of Propofol-Treated Developing Rat Hippocampal Astrocytes.
PMID: 26083276
Authors: Wenchong W. Sun, Ling L. Pei
Abstract: Although propofol exerts toxic effects on the developing central nervous system (CNS), it remains a first-choice anesthetic in the pediatric population. Astrocytes represent a major glial cell population whose role in CNS development is widely appreciated and that has been recently shown to be mediated in large part by microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast, relatively little is known about the roles of miRNAs in developing astrocytes during propofol treatment. Here, miRNA microarray was used to profile fluctuations in miRNA expression in immature hippocampal astrocytes in response to propofol treatment, and results were subsequently validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Predictive analysis of genes targeted by propofol-regulated miRNAs indicated enrichment of genes in the gene ontology (GO) nervous system development and differentiation category, and in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) apoptotic pathway category. A total of 24 (10 short-term dosage and 14 long-term dosage) miRNAs were significantly regulated, one of which was rno-miR-665. Ectopic overexpression and silencing of rno-miR-665 demonstrated its role in the neurotoxic effects of propofol on hippocampal immature astrocytes. We present evidence that the role of rno-miR-665 in anesthesia-induced disturbances in astroglia development may involve direct downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2l1, and subsequent increased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Our results shed light on the anesthetic mechanism of propofol and have implications for its use in the clinical setting.

Title #652: BAM 1 and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 constitute a signaling pathway and modulate CLE peptide-triggered growth inhibition in Arabidopsis root.
PMID: 26083273

Abstract: Ligand receptor-based signaling is a means of cell-to-cell communication for coordinating developmental and physiological processes in multicellular organisms. In plants, cell-producing meristems utilize this signaling to regulate their activities and ensure for proper development. Shoot and root systems share common requirements for carrying out this process; however, its molecular basis is largely unclear. It has been suggested that synthetic CLV3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide shrinks the root meristem through the actions of CLAVATA2 (CLV2) and the RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2) pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our genetic screening for mutations that resist CLE peptide signaling in roots determined that BAM1, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) family, is also involved in this pathway. BAM1 is preferentially expressed in the root tip, including the quiescent center and its surrounding stem cells. Our genetic analysis revealed that BAM1 functions together with RPK2. Using coimmunoprecipitation assay, we showed that BAM1 is capable of forming heteromeric complexes with RPK2. These findings suggest that the BAM1 and RPK2 receptors constitute a signaling pathway that modulates cell proliferation in the root meristem and that related molecules are employed in root and shoot meristems.


Title #653: Charge Transfer Induced Multifunctional Transitions with Sensitive Pressure Manipulation in a Metal-Organic Framework.

Abstract: The metal-organic framework {[Fe(2,2'-bipyridine)(CN)4]2Co(4,4'-bipyridine)}Â·4H2O (Fe2Co-MOF) with single-chain magnetism undergoes an intermetallic charge transfer that converts the Fe2Co charge/spin configurations from Fe(3+)LS-Co(2+)HS-Fe(3+)LS to Fe(2+)LS-Co(3+)LS-Fe(3+)LS (LS = low spin, HS = high spin) around 220 K under ambient pressure. A series of coherent phase transitions in structure, magnetism, permittivity and ferroelectricity are found to take place accompanying with the charge transfer, making Fe2Co-MOF a unique ferroelectric single-chain magnet at low temperature. Moreover, our detailed measurements of magnetization, dielectric constant, and Raman scattering under high pressures illustrate that the charge transfer as well as the resulting multifunctional transitions can be readily induced to occur at room temperature by applying a tiny external pressure of about 0.5 kbar. The present study thus provides a pressure well-controllable multifunctional material with potential applications in a broad temperature region across room temperature.


Title #654: The Roles of Rasd1 small G proteins and leptin in the activation of TRPC4 transient receptor potential channels.
PMID: 26083271
Authors: Jinhong J. Wie, Byung Joo BJ. Kim, Jongyun J. Myeong, Kotdaji K. Ha, Seung Joo SJ. Jeong, Dongki D. Yang, Euiyong E. Kim, Ju-Hong JH. Jeon, Insuk I. So
Abstract: TRPC4 is important regulators of electrical excitability in gastrointestinal myocytes, pancreatic Î²-cells and neurons. Much is known regarding the assembly and function of these channels including TRPC1 as a homotetramer or a heteromultimer and the roles that their interacting proteins play in controlling these events. Further, they are one of the best-studied targets of G protein-coupled receptors and growth factors in general and GÎ±i/o and GÎ±q protein coupled receptor or epidermal growth factor and leptin in particular. However, our understanding of the roles of small G proteins and leptin on TRPC4 channels is still rudimentary. We discuss potential roles for Rasd1 small G protein and leptin in channel activation in addition to their known role in cellular signaling.

Abstract: Our objective is to analyze whether the combination of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), presepsin or SCD14-ST and mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) measured in the first 24 h from ICU admission allowing a better management of septic patients (diagnostic and prognostic) both in severe sepsis (SS) and septic shock (SSh).


Title #656: Protein Aggregate Formation In Oligodendrocytes: Tau And The Cytoskeleton At The Intersection Of Neuroprotection And Neurodegeneration.
PMID: 26083267
Authors: Christiane C. Richter-Landsberg
Abstract: Oligodendrocytes are dependent on an intact, dynamic microtubule (MT) network, which participates in the elaboration and stabilization of myelin forming extensions, and is essential for cellular sorting processes. The microtubule associated protein tau is a constituent of oligodendrocytes. During culture maturation it is developmentally regulated and important for MT stability, MT formation and intracellular trafficking. Downregulation of tau impairs process outgrowth and the transport of myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA to the cell periphery. Cells fail to differentiate into MBP expressing, sheet forming oligodendrocytes. Tau-positive inclusions originating in oligodendrocytes and white matter pathology are prominent in frontotemporal dementias, such as Pick`s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. An impairment or overload of the proteolytic degradation systems, i.e. the ubiquitin proteasomal system and the lysosomal degradation pathway, has been connected to the formation of protein aggregates. Large protein aggregates are excluded from the proteasome and degraded by autophagy, which is a highly selective process and requires receptor proteins for ubiquitinated proteins, including histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). HDAC6 is present in oligodendrocytes, and Î±-tubulin and tau are substrates of HDAC6. In this review our current knowledge of the role of tau and protein aggregate formation in oligodendrocyte cell culture systems is summarized.


Title #657: Fluorescence And Excited State Dynamics Of The Deprotonated Schiff Base Retinal In Proteorhodopsin.
PMID: 26083266
Authors: Elena E. BÃ¼hl, Markus M. Braun, Andrea A. Lakatos, Clemens C. Glaubitz, Josef J. Wachtveitl
Abstract: The UV light absorbing species of proteorhodopsin with deprotonated Schiff base retinal was investigated using steady-state fluorescence and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Compared to the all-trans retinal with protonated Schiff base, the deprotonated chromophore absorbs at 365 nm and exhibits a blue-shifted fluorescence spectrum. The unusually long-lived excited state decays bi-exponentially with time constants of 8 ps and 130 ps to form a deprotonated 13-cis retinal as the primary photo-product.


Title #658: Increased Epstein-Barr Virus DNA Load and Antibodies Against EBNA1 and EA in Sardinian Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Abstract: A role for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection in the etiology of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has long been suggested. However, data about EBV burden in RA patients from Sardinian population, a genetic isolate with high prevalence of autoimmune diseases, have not yet been reported. One hundred thirty-five, Sardinian subjects (77 RA patients and 58 demographically matched healthy donors, HDs) were enrolled in a cross-sectional case-control study. EBV-DNA was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Prevalence and titers of anti-Early Antigen IgG (anti-EA-IgG) and anti-Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 IgG (anti-EBNA-1 IgG) were determined by immunoenzimatic assay. EBV-DNA positivity was more frequent in RA PBMCs than in HD PBMCs (79.2% vs. 56.9% respectively, p=0.008). Similarly EBV relative load was increased in RA than in HD PBMCs [2.83 (6.5) vs. 0.53 (1) 2(-ÎCt) EBV-DNA, respectively, p=0.02]. Moreover, Sardinian RA patients were found to have increased prevalence of anti-EBNA-1 IgG (90% vs. only 69% of HD, p=0.006) and anti-EA IgG (37% compared with only 10.3% of HD, p=0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed that PBMCs from RA receiving Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal inhibitor, have significantly lower EBV viral loads in comparison to PBMCs from RA under other immunosuppressors (p=0.03). These data suggest an association between EBV infection and RA in the Sardinian population. The potential influence of IL-6 inhibition on EBV viral load in RA patients should be further explored in prospective trials.


Title #659: White Light Emission from Vegetable Extracts.
PMID: 26083264
Authors: Vikram V. Singh, Ashok K AK. Mishra
Abstract: A mixture of extracts from two common vegetables, red pomegranate and turmeric, when photoexcited at 380ânm, produced almost pure white light emission (WLE) with Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity index (0.35, 0.33) in acidic ethanol. It was also possible to obtain WLE in polyvinyl alcohol film (0.32, 0.25), and in gelatin gel (0.26, 0.33) using the same extract mixture. The colour temperature of the WLE was conveniently tunable by simply adjusting the concentrations of the component emitters. The primary emitting pigments responsible for contributing to WLE were polyphenols and anthocyanins from pomegranate, and curcumin from turmeric. It was observed that a cascade of Forster resonance energy transfer involving polyphenolics, curcumin and anthocyanins played a crucial role in obtaining a CIE index close to pure white light. The optimized methods of extraction of the two primary emitting pigments from their corresponding plant sources are simple, cheap and fairly green.


Title #660: Where You Live May Make You Old: The Association between Perceived Poor Neighborhood Quality and Leukocyte Telomere Length.
PMID: 26083263
Authors: Mijung M. Park, Josine E JE. Verhoeven, Pim P. Cuijpers, Charles F CF. Reynolds Iii, Brenda W J H BW. Penninx
Abstract: Strong evidence supports that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods has direct unfavorable impact on mental and physical health. However, whether it also has direct impact on cellular health is largely unknown. Thus we examined whether neighborhood quality was associated with leukocyte telomere length, an indicator of cellular aging.


Title #661: The Geographic Distribution of a Tropical Montane Bird Is Limited by a Tree: Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) and Colombian Oaks (Quercus humboldtii) in the Northern Andes.
PMID: 26083262
Authors: Benjamin G BG. Freeman, Nicholas A NA. Mason
Abstract: Species distributions are limited by a complex array of abiotic and biotic factors. In general, abiotic (climatic) factors are thought to explain species' broad geographic distributions, while biotic factors regulate species' abundance patterns at local scales. We used species distribution models to test the hypothesis that a biotic interaction with a tree, the Colombian oak (Quercus humboldtii), limits the broad-scale distribution of the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) in the Northern Andes of South America. North American populations of Acorn Woodpeckers consume acorns from Quercus oaks and are limited by the presence of Quercus oaks. However, Acorn Woodpeckers in the Northern Andes seldom consume Colombian oak acorns (though may regularly drink sap from oak trees) and have been observed at sites without Colombian oaks, the sole species of Quercus found in South America. We found that climate-only models overpredicted Acorn Woodpecker distribution, suggesting that suitable abiotic conditions (e.g. in northern Ecuador) exist beyond the woodpecker's southern range margin. In contrast, models that incorporate Colombian oak presence outperformed climate-only models and more accurately predicted the location of the Acorn Woodpecker's southern range margin in southern Colombia. These findings support the hypothesis that a biotic interaction with Colombian oaks sets Acorn Woodpecker's broad-scale geographic limit in South America, probably because Acorn Woodpeckers rely on Colombian oaks as a food resource (possibly for the oak's sap rather than for acorns). Although empirical examples of particular plants limiting tropical birds' distributions are scarce, we predict that similar biotic interactions may play an important role in structuring the geographic distributions of many species of tropical montane birds with specialized foraging behavior.

Abstract: Iron-overload cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in thalassemia patients due to the lack of an early detection strategy. Although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* is used for early detection of cardiac iron accumulation, its availability is limited. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to evaluate cardiac autonomic function and found to be depressed in thalassemia. However, its direct correlation with cardiac iron accumulation has never been investigated. We investigated whether HRV can be used as an alternative indicator for early identification of cardiac iron deposition in thalassemia patients.


Title #665: Isolation of High-Quality Total RNA from Chinese Fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook).
PMID: 26083257
Authors: Zhihui Z. Ma, Binlong B. Huang, Shanshan S. Xu, Yu Y. Chen, Shubin S. Li, Sizu S. Lin
Abstract: RNA isolation with RNA in a high quantity is a basic analytical method in plant genetics, molecular biology and related physiological investigations. To understand the genetic and molecular biology of Chinese fir, sufficient high-quality total RNA must be obtained for cDNA library construction and other downstream molecular applications. However, extracting RNA from Chinese fir is difficult and often requires the modification of existing protocols. Chinese fir tissues containing large amounts of polysaccharides and polyphenol compounds and are one of the most difficult plant tissues for RNA isolation. Therefore, we developed a simple method for extracting high-quality RNA from Chinese fir tissues. RNA isolations were performed within two hours, RNA quality was measured for yield and purity. Total RNA obtained from this procedure was successfully used for cDNA library construction, RT-PCR and transcriptome sequencing. It was proven that extracted RNA was intact and suitable for downstream molecular applications, including RT-PCR and qPCR, and other downstream molecular applications. Thus, this protocol represents a simple, efficient, and low-cost method.

Title #667: Regular Exercise Enhances Task-Based Industriousness in Laboratory Rats.
PMID: 26083255
Authors: Nicholas C NC. Laurence, Lisa G LG. Labuschagne, Brent G BG. Lura, Kristin L KL. Hillman
Abstract: Individuals vary greatly in their willingness to select and persist in effortful tasks, even when high-effort will knowingly result in high-reward. Individuals who select and successively complete effortful, goal-directed tasks can be described as industrious. Trying to increase one's industriousness is desirable from a productivity standpoint, yet intrinsically challenging given that effort expenditure is generally aversive. Here we show that in laboratory rats, a basic physical exercise regimen (20 min/day, five days/week) is sufficient to increase industriousness across a battery of subsequent testing tasks. Exercised rats outperformed their non-exercised counterparts in tasks designed to tax effort expenditure, strategic decision-making, problem solving and persistence. These increases in performance led to quicker reward obtainment and greater reward gain over time, and could not be accounted for simply by increased locomotor activity. Our results suggest that a basic exercise regimen can enhance effortful goal-directed behaviour in goal-directed tasks, which highlights a potential productivity benefit of staying physically active.


Title #668: Risk Assessment of Genetically Engineered Maize Resistant to Diabrotica spp.: Influence on Above-Ground Arthropods in the Czech Republic.

Abstract: Transgenic maize MON88017, expressing the Cry3Bb1 toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize), confers resistance to corn rootworms (Diabrotica spp.) and provides tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate. However, prior to commercialization, substantial assessment of potential effects on non-target organisms within agroecosystems is required. The MON88017 event was therefore evaluated under field conditions in Southern Bohemia in 2009-2011, to detect possible impacts on the above-ground arthropod species. The study compared MON88017, its near-isogenic non-Bt hybrid DK315 (treated or not treated with the soil insecticide Dursban 10G) and two non-Bt reference hybrids (KIPOUS and PR38N86). Each hybrid was grown on five 0.5 ha plots distributed in a 14-ha field with a Latin square design. Semiquantitative ELISA was used to verify Cry3Bb1 toxin levels in the Bt maize. The species spectrum of non-target invertebrates changed during seasons and was affected by weather conditions. The thrips Frankliniella occidentalis was the most abundant species in all three successive years. The next most common species were aphids Rhopalosiphum padi and Metopolophium dirhodum. Frequently observed predators included Orius spp. and several species within the Coccinellidae. Throughout the three-year study, analysis of variance indicated some significant differences (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the abundance and diversity of plant dwelling insects was similar in maize with the same genetic background, for both Bt (MON88017) and non-Bt (DK315) untreated or insecticide treated. KIPOUS and PR38N86 showed some differences in species abundance relative to the Bt maize and its near-isogenic hybrid. However, the effect of management regime on arthropod community was insignificant and accounted only for a negligible portion of the variability.


Title #669: Two Cdc2 Kinase Genes with Distinct Functions in Vegetative and Infectious Hyphae in Fusarium graminearum.
PMID: 26083253
Authors: Huiquan H. Liu, Shijie S. Zhang, Jiwen J. Ma, Yafeng Y. Dai, Chaohui C. Li, Xueliang X. Lyu, Chenfang C. Wang, Jin-Rong JR. Xu
Abstract: Eukaryotic cell cycle involves a number of protein kinases important for the onset and progression through mitosis, most of which are well characterized in the budding and fission yeasts and conserved in other fungi. However, unlike the model yeast and filamentous fungi that have a single Cdc2 essential for cell cycle progression, the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum contains two CDC2 orthologs. The cdc2A and cdc2B mutants had no obvious defects in growth rate and conidiation but deletion of both of them is lethal, indicating that these two CDC2 orthologs have redundant functions during vegetative growth and asexual reproduction. However, whereas the cdc2B mutant was normal, the cdc2A mutant was significantly reduced in virulence and rarely produced ascospores. Although deletion of CDC2A had no obvious effect on the formation of penetration branches or hyphopodia, the cdc2A mutant was limited in the differentiation and growth of infectious growth in wheat tissues. Therefore, CDC2A plays stage-specific roles in cell cycle regulation during infectious growth and sexual reproduction. Both CDC2A and CDC2B are constitutively expressed but only CDC2A was up-regulated during plant infection and ascosporogenesis. Localization of Cdc2A- GFP to the nucleus but not Cdc2B-GFP was observed in vegetative hyphae, ascospores, and infectious hyphae. Complementation assays with chimeric fusion constructs showed that both the N- and C-terminal regions of Cdc2A are important for its functions in pathogenesis and ascosporogenesis but only the N-terminal region is important for its subcellular localization. Among the Sordariomycetes, only three Fusarium species closely related to F. graminearum have two CDC2 genes. Furthermore, F. graminearum uniquely has two Aurora kinase genes and one additional putative cyclin gene, and its orthologs of CAK1 and other four essential mitotic kinases in the budding yeast are dispensable for viability. Overall, our data indicate that cell cycle regulation is different between vegetative and infectious hyphae in F. graminearum and Cdc2A, possibly by interacting with a stage-specific cyclin, plays a more important role than Cdc2B during ascosporogenesis and plant infection.

Abstract: It is well-established that male circumcision reduces acquisition of HIV, herpes simplex virus 2, chancroid, and syphilis. However, the effect on the acquisition of non-ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remains unclear. We examined the relationship between circumcision and biological measures of three STIs: human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium.


Title #673: Selective Cytotoxicity of 1,3,4-Thiadiazolium Mesoionic Derivatives on Hepatocarcinoma Cells (HepG2).
PMID: 26083249

Acco, Carlos Eduardo CE. Alves de Souza, Aurea A. Echevarria, Camilla C. Moretto Dos Reis, Attilio A. Di Pietro, SÃ­lvia Maria SM. Suter Correia Cadena
Abstract: In this work, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of mesoionic 4-phenyl-5-(2-Y, 4-X or 4-X-cinnamoyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazolium-2-phenylamine chloride derivatives (MI-J: X=OH, Y=H; MI-D: X=NO2, Y=H; MI-4F: X=F, Y=H; MI-2,4diF: X=Y=F) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and non-tumor cells (rat hepatocytes) for comparison. MI-J, M-4F and MI-2,4diF reduced HepG2 viability by ~ 50% at 25 Î¼M after 24-h treatment, whereas MI-D required a 50 Î¼M concentration, as shown by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. The cytotoxicity was confirmed with lactate dehydrogenase assay, of which activity was increased by 55, 24 and 16% for MI-J, MI-4F and MI-2,4diF respectively (at 25 Î¼M after 24 h). To identify the death pathway related to cytotoxicity, the HepG2 cells treated by mesoionic compounds were labeled with both annexin V and PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry. All compounds increased the number of doubly-stained cells at 25 Î¼M after 24 h: by 76% for MI-J, 25% for MI-4F and MI-2,4diF, and 11% for MI-D. It was also verified that increased DNA fragmentation occurred upon MI-J, MI-4F and MI-2,4diF treatments (by 12%, 9% and 8%, respectively, at 25 Î¼M after 24 h). These compounds were only weakly, or not at all, transported by the main multidrug transporters, P-glycoprotein, ABCG2 and MRP1, and were able to slightly inhibit their drug-transport activity. It may be concluded that 1,3,4-thiadiazolium compounds, especially the hydroxy derivative MI-J, constitute promising candidates for future investigations on in-vivo treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.


Title #674: Change in Mesoherbivore Browsing Is Mediated by Elephant and Hillslope Position.
PMID: 26083248

Abstract: Elephant are considered major drivers of ecosystems, but their effects within small-scale landscape features and on other herbivores still remain unclear. Elephant impact on vegetation has been widely studied in areas where elephant have been present for many years. We therefore examined the combined effect of short-term elephant presence (< 4 years) and hillslope position on tree species assemblages, resource availability, browsing intensity and soil properties. Short-term elephant presence did not affect woody species assemblages, but did affect height distribution, with greater sapling densities in elephant access areas. Overall tree and stem densities were also not affected by elephant. By contrast, slope position affected woody species assemblages, but not height distributions and densities. Variation in species assemblages was statistically best explained by levels of total cations, Zinc, sand and clay. Although elephant and mesoherbivore browsing intensities were unaffected by slope position, we found lower mesoherbivore browsing intensity on crests with high elephant browsing intensity. Thus, elephant appear to indirectly facilitate the survival of saplings, via the displacement of mesoherbivores, providing a window of opportunity for saplings to grow into taller trees. In the short-term, effects of elephant can be minor and in the opposite direction of expectation. In addition, such behavioural displacement promotes recruitment of saplings into larger height classes. The interaction between slope position and elephant effect found here is in contrast with other studies, and illustrates the importance of examining ecosystem complexity as a function of variation in species presence and topography. The absence of a direct effect of elephant on vegetation, but the presence of an effect on mesoherbivore browsing, is relevant for conservation areas especially where both herbivore groups are actively managed.

PMID: 26083247
Authors: Maria M. Persson, K Miriam KM. ElfstrÃ¶m, Sven-Erik SE. Olsson, Joakim J. Dillner, Sonia S. Andersson
Abstract: Diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are common, but the corresponding risk of disease varies by human papillomavirus (HPV) status, complicating management strategies. Our aim was to estimate the longer-term risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) among women with ASCUS/LSIL by age, HPV status, and genotype(s).


Title #676: Emergent Stratification in Solid Tumors Selects for Reduced Cohesion of Tumor Cells: A Multi-Cell, Virtual-Tissue Model of Tumor Evolution Using CompuCell3D.
PMID: 26083246
Authors: Maciej H MH. Swat, Gilberto L GL. Thomas, Abbas A. Shirinifard, Sherry G SG. Clendenon, James A JA. Glazier
Abstract: Tumor cells and structure both evolve due to heritable variation of cell behaviors and selection over periods of weeks to years (somatic evolution). Micro-environmental factors exert selection pressures on tumor-cell behaviors, which influence both the rate and direction of evolution of specific behaviors, especially the development of tumor-cell aggression and resistance to chemotherapies. In this paper, we present, step-by-step, the development of a multi-cell, virtual-tissue model of tumor somatic evolution, simulated using the open-source CompuCell3D modeling environment. Our model includes essential cell behaviors, microenvironmental components and their interactions. Our model provides a platform for exploring selection pressures leading to the evolution of tumor-cell aggression, showing that emergent stratification into regions with different cell survival rates drives the evolution of less cohesive cells with lower levels of cadherins and higher levels of integrins. Such reduced cohesivity is a key hallmark in the progression of many types of solid tumors.


Title #677: Birds in Anthropogenic Landscapes: The Responses of Ecological Groups to Forest Loss in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
PMID: 26083245
Authors: JosÃ© Carlos JC. Morante-Filho, Deborah D. Faria, Eduardo E. Mariano-Neto, Jonathan J. Rhodes
Abstract: Habitat loss is the dominant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial environments. In this study, we used an a priori classification of bird species based on their dependence on native forest habitats (forest-specialist and habitat generalists) and specific food resources (frugivores and insectivores) to evaluate their responses to forest cover reduction in landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. From the patch-landscapes approach, we delimited 40 forest sites, and quantified the percentage of native forest within a 2 km radius around the center of each site (from 6 - 85%). At each site, we sampled birds using the point-count method. We used a null model, a generalized linear model and a four-parameter logistic model to evaluate the relationship between richness and abundance of the bird groups and the native forest amount. A piecewise model was then used to determine the threshold value for bird groups that showed nonlinear responses. The richness and abundance of the bird community as a whole were not affected by changes in forest cover in this region. However, a decrease in forest cover had a negative effect on diversity of forest-specialist, frugivorous and insectivorous birds, and a positive effect on generalist birds. The species richness and abundance of all ecological groups were nonlinearly related to forest reduction and showed similar threshold values, i.e., there were abrupt changes in individuals and species numbers when forest amount was less than approximately 50%. Forest sites within landscapes with forest cover that was less than 50% contained a different bird species composition than more extensively forested sites and had fewer forest-specialist species and higher beta-diversity. Our study demonstrated the pervasive effect of forest reduction on bird communities in one of the most important hotspots for bird conservation and shows that many vulnerable species require extensive forest cover to persist.


Title #678: Cross Sectional Study Evaluating Routine Contact Investigation in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A Missed Opportunity to Prevent Tuberculosis in Children.
PMID: 26083244
Authors: Dawit D. Assefa, Eveline E. Klinkenberg, Genet G. Yosef
Abstract: The 2013 global roadmap for childhood tuberculosis calls for countries to implement contact screening and provide preventive therapy to children younger than 5 years. Therefore, this study designed to evaluate the implementation status of child contact screening and management in the health facilities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Smear positive TB patients living with children attending daily observed treatment at the TB clinic and health care workers providing service were approached to address the study objective. Structured questionnaires were administered to smear positive index cases living with children whether they were requested to bring children age five year and below for TB screening and to health care providers in HIV, TB and child health clinics to assess their knowledge and practice on contact screening and management. Double data entry and analysis was done using EpiData software 3.1. In 27 health centres, 688 smear-positive index tuberculosis patients were approached of whom 203 (29.5%) reported to have children five years and below in their household. A total of 48 (23.6%) index cases had been requested by the health care workers to bring their children for tuberculosis screening and 45 (93.8%) had complied with this request. Of 230 children living with index smear positive tuberculosis patient, 152 (66.1%) were not screened for tuberculosis, 78 (33.9%) children screened, 2 had tuberculosis, 76 screened negative of which 3 (3.8%) received preventive treatment. None of the health care workers indicated to routinely record and report on child contact management. Household child contact screening and preventive intervention was sub-optimal in Addis Ababa. An important opportunity lost to prevent tuberculosis in young children. Training of health care workers, availing simple symptom based screening tool, and proper documentation could improve implementation.


Title #679: New Species of Boletellus Section Boletellus (Boletaceae, Boletales) from Japan, B. aurocontextus sp. nov. and B. areolatus sp. nov.
PMID: 26083243
Authors: Hirotoshi H. Sato, Tsutomu T. Hattori
Abstract: We describe and illustrate two new species of Boletellus section Boletellus, B. aurocontextus sp. nov. and B. areolatus sp. nov., which are generally assumed to be B. emodensis. In this study, we reconstructed separate molecular phylogenetic trees of section Boletellus using the nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, the largest subunit (RPB1) and the second-largest subunit (RPB2) of nuclear RNA polymerase II gene and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 (cox3) gene. We also examined the morphologies of B. emodensis sensu lato (s.l.) and other related species for comparison. The molecular phylogenetic tree inferred from the sequences of nuclear DNA (ITS, and combined dataset of RPB1 and RPB2) indicated that three genetically and phylogenetically well-separated lineages were present within B. emodensis s.l. These three lineages were also distinguished on the basis of the molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using the sequences of mitochondrial DNA (cox3), suggesting distinct cytonuclear disequilibria (i.e., evidence of reproductive isolation) among these lineages. Therefore, these three lineages can be treated as independent species: B. aurocontextus, B. areolatus, and B. emodensis. Boletellus aurocontextus and B. areolatus are also distinct from B. emodensis by the macro- and microscopic morphologies. Boletellus aurocontextus is characterized by a pileus with bright yellow to lemon yellow context, which can be observed through a gap in the scales, and basidiospores with relatively large length (mean spore length, 21.4 Î¼m; quotient of spore length and width, 2.51). In contrast, B. areolatus is characterized by a pileus with floccose to appressed thin scaly patches, a stipe with pallid or pale cream color at the upper half, and basidiospores with relatively small length (mean spore length, 16.5 Î¼m; quotient of spore length and width, 1.80).


Title #680: Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Pharmacogenomic Loci For Therapeutic Response to Montelukast in Asthma.

Abstract: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful tool to identify novel pharmacogenetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a major class of asthma medications, and genetic factors contribute to variable responses to these drugs. We used GWAS to identify novel SNPs associated with the response to the LTRA, montelukast, in asthmatics.


Title #681: Effect of Induced Mild Hypothermia on Acid-Base Balance During Experimental Acute Sepsis in Rats.
PMID: 26083241
Authors: Karelle K. LÃ©on, Karine K. Pichavant-Rafini, HÃ©lÃ¨ne H. Ollivier, Erwan E. L'Her
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of induced mild hypothermia (34Â°C) on acid-base balance in septic rats. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats median weight 306âg, range 251-333âg were used. After anesthesia and when the target temperature was reached (normothermia: 38Â°C or induced mild hypothermia: 34Â°C), sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation. Measurements of cardiopulmonary parameters and blood samples were performed at T0h (occurring immediately after chirurgical procedures), T2h, T4h (at each temperature), and T6h (at 34Â°C only). Blood oxygen saturation, heart and respiratory rates, arterial blood pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium concentrations, hematocrit, blood lactate, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-6 concentrations were measured on anesthetized rats. Other parameters such as bicarbonate concentration, hemoglobin concentration, base excess, and anion gap were estimated from measured parameters. Main results showed that an increase in both cytokines concentrations was observed in septic rats compared with sham rats. This increase was less marked at 34Â°C compared with 38Â°C. Moreover, sepsis induction led to a marked metabolic acidosis and hypothermia delayed this acidosis. Induced mild hypothermia delays the evolution of cytokines and metabolic acidosis during experimental sepsis.


Title #682: Creatine supplementation decreases plasma lipid peroxidation markers and enhances anaerobic performance in rats.
PMID: 26083240
Authors: Rafael R. Deminice, Alceu Afonso AA. Jordao
Abstract: Objective The study was to investigate the effects of creatine (Cr) supplementation on oxidative stress markers and anaerobic performance in rats. Methods Sixty-four rats (Wistar) were divided into two groups: C, anaerobic exercised group (nÂ =Â 32) and Cr, anaerobic exercised group supplemented with creatine (nÂ =Â 32). Cr supplementation consisted of the addition of 2% Cr monohydrate to the diet. After 28 days, the rats performed acute exercise (6Â ÃÂ 30Â seconds of vertical jumps in the water with 30Â seconds rest and 50% of total body weight load attached in the back). The animals were euthanized before (pre) and at 0, 2, and 6 hours (nÂ =Â 8) after acute exercise. Results Acute exercise induced an increase in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), as well as increased total lipid hydroperoxides and AOPP in gastrocnemius muscle. Cr supplementation inhibited the formation of MDA and lipid hydroperoxides in plasma. However, the antioxidant action of Cr was observed only against AOPP in gastrocnemius muscle. Cr supplementation also increased (PÂ <Â 0.05) anaerobic performance compared to the C group. Conclusion Cr supplementation is able to inhibit the increase in plasma lipid peroxidation markers induced by high-intensity and short-duration exercise in rats; equivalent actions, however, were not observed fully in muscle tissue.


Title #683: Optimization and comparison of simultaneous and separate acquisition protocols for dual isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT.
PMID: 26083239
Authors: Michael M. Ghaly, Jonathan M JM. Links, Eric E. C Frey
Abstract: Dual-isotope simultaneous-acquisition (DISA) rest-stress myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) protocols offer a number of advantages over separate acquisition. However, crosstalk contamination due to scatter in the patient and interactions in the collimator degrade image quality. Compensation can reduce the effects of crosstalk, but does not entirely eliminate image degradations. Optimizing acquisition parameters could further reduce the impact of crosstalk. In this paper we investigate the optimization of the rest Tl-201 energy window width and relative injected activities using the ideal observer (IO), a realistic digital phantom population and Monte Carlo (MC) simulated Tc-99m and Tl-201 projections as a means to improve image quality. We compared performance on a perfusion defect detection task for Tl-201 acquisition energy window widths varying from 4 to 40âkeV centered at 72âkeV for a camera with a 9% energy resolution. We also investigated 7 different relative injected activities, defined as the ratio of Tc-99m and Tl-201 activities, while keeping the total effective dose constant at 13.5âmSv. For each energy window and relative injected activity, we computed the IO test statistics using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for an ensemble of 1,620 triplets of fixed and reversible defect-present, and defect-absent noisy images modeling realistic background variations. The volume under the 3-class receiver operating characteristic (ROC) surface (VUS) was estimated and served as the figure of merit. For simultaneous acquisition, the IO suggested that relative Tc-to-Tl injected activity ratios of 2.6-5 and acquisition energy window widths of 16-22% were optimal. For separate acquisition, we observed a broad range of optimal relative injected activities from 2.6 to 12.1 and acquisition energy window of widths 16-22%. A negative correlation between Tl-201 injected activity and the width of the Tl-201 energy window was observed in these ranges. The results also suggested that DISA methods could potentially provide image quality as good as that obtained with separate acquisition protocols. We compared observer performance for the optimized protocols and the current clinical protocol using separate acquisition. The current clinical protocols provided better performance at a cost of injecting the patient with approximately double the injected activity of Tc-99m and Tl-201, resulting in substantially increased radiation dose.

Abstract: Murine postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to either neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, however our knowledge of the genes that control this lineage-specification is incomplete. Here we show that Nuclear Factor I X (NFIX), a transcription factor known to regulate NSC quiescence, also suppresses oligodendrogenesis (ODG) from NSCs. Immunostaining reveals little or no expression of NFIX in oligodendrocyte (OL)-lineage cells both in vivo and in vitro. Loss of NFIX from subventricular zone NSCs results in enhanced ODG both in vivo and in vitro, while forced expression of NFIX blocks NSC differentiation into OLs in vitro. RNA-seq analysis shows that genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in OL progenitors are significantly enriched in RNA from Nfix-/- vs. wild type NSCs. These data indicate that NFIX influences the lineage-specification of postnatal subventricular zone NSCs, specifically suppressing ODG.

Abstract: Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a key protease for matrix degradation. High HNE activity is observed in inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, HNE is a potential target for the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchiectasis (BE), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). HNE inhibitors should reestablish the protease-anti-protease balance. By means of medicinal chemistry a novel dihydropyrimidinone lead-structure class was identified. Further chemical optimization yielded orally active compounds with favorable pharmacokinetics such as the chemical probe BAY-678. While maintaining outstanding target selectivity, picomolar potency was achieved by locking the bioactive conformation of these inhibitors with a strategically positioned methyl sulfone substituent. An induced-fit binding mode allowed tight interactions with the S2 and S1 pockets of HNE. BAYâ85-8501 ((4S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carbonitrile) was shown to be efficacious in a rodent animal model related to ALI. BAYâ85-8501 is currently being tested in clinical studies for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.


Title #686: Pseudoephedrine-Directed Asymmetric Î±-Arylation of Î±-Amino Acid Derivatives.
PMID: 26083236
Authors: Rachel C RC. Atkinson, Fernando F. FernÃ¡ndez-Nieto, Josep J. Mas RosellÃ³, Jonathan J. Clayden
Abstract: Available Î±-amino acids undergo arylation at their Î± position in an enantioselective manner on treatment with base of N'-aryl urea derivatives ligated to pseudoephedrine as a chiral auxiliary. In situ silylation and enolization induces diastereoselective migration of the N'-aryl group to the Î± position of the amino acid, followed by ring closure to a hydantoin with concomitant explulsion of the recyclable auxiliary. The hydrolysis of the hydantoin products provides derivatives of quaternary amino acids. The arylation avoids the use of heavy-metal additives, and is successful with a range of amino acids and with aryl rings of varying electronic character.


Title #687: Trends in Mammography Over Time for Women With and Without Chronic Disability.
PMID: 26083235
Authors: Lisa I LI. Iezzoni, Stephen G SG. Kurtz, Sowmya R SR. Rao
Abstract: Women with disabilities often receive mammograms at lower rates than do nondisabled women, although this disparity varies by disability type and severity. Given the implementation of disability civil rights laws in the early 1990s, we examined whether disability disparities in mammogram use have diminished over time.


Title #688: Cross-talk of nataxazole pathway with chorismate-derived ionophore biosynthesis pathways in Streptomyces sp. TÃ¼ 6176.
PMID: 26083234
Authors: Carolina C. Cano-Prieto, Armando A AA. Losada, Alfredo F AF. BraÃ±a, Carmen C. MÃ©ndez, JosÃ©A J. Salas, Carlos C. Olano
Abstract: Streptomyces sp. TÃ¼ 6176, known as producer of cytotoxic benzoxazoles AJI9561, nataxazole and 5-hydroxy-nataxazole, has been found to produce also a fourth benzoxazole, UK-1. All of them derive from 3-hydroxy-anthranilate synthesized by nataxazole biosynthesis machinery. However, biosynthesis of AJI9561, nataxazole and 5-hydroxy-nataxazole requires 6-methylsalicylic acid also provided by nataxazole biosynthesis pathway, while biosynthesis of UK-1 utilizes salicylic acid produced by a salicylate synthase from coelibactin biosynthesis pathway. This clearly suggests cross-talk between nataxazole and coelibactin pathways.Furthermore, Streptomyces sp. TÃ¼ 6176 also produces siderophore enterobactin in an iron-free medium. Enterobactin production can be induced in an iron-independent manner by inactivating natAN that encodes an anthranilate synthase involved in nataxazole production. All these results indicate a close relationship between nataxazole, enterobactin and coelibactin pathways.


Title #689: Analysis of Intelligent Transportation Systems Using Model-Driven Simulations.
PMID: 26083232
Authors: Alberto A. FernÃ¡ndez-Isabel, RubÃ©n R. Fuentes-FernÃ¡ndez
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) integrate information, sensor, control, and communication technologies to provide transport related services. Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers and urban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and their environment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible. Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues: there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code; their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compare works that use different models and tools. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven development of these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language that supports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS: people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network of sensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed that operates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generate specifications compliant with that language, and a code generator to produce code from them using platform specifications. There are also guidelines to help researchers in the application of this infrastructure. A case study on advanced management of traffic lights with cameras illustrates its use.


Title #690: A High Performance Banknote Recognition System Based on a One-Dimensional Visible Light Line Sensor.
PMID: 26083231

Abstract: An algorithm for recognizing banknotes is required in many fields, such as banknote-counting machines and automatic teller machines (ATM). Due to the size and cost limitations of banknote-counting machines and ATMs, the banknote image is usually captured by a one-dimensional (line) sensor instead of a conventional two-dimensional (area) sensor. Because the banknote image is captured by the line sensor while it is moved at fast speed through the rollers inside the banknote-counting machine or ATM, misalignment, geometric distortion, and non-uniform illumination of the captured images frequently occur, which degrades the banknote recognition accuracy. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method for recognizing banknotes. The experimental results using two-fold cross-validation for 61,240 United States dollar (USD) images show that the pre-classification error rate is 0%, and the average error rate for the final recognition of the USD banknotes is 0.114%.


Title #691: Estimation of Prestress Force Distribution in the Multi-Strand System of Prestressed Concrete Structures.
PMID: 26083230
Authors: Keunhee K. Cho, Sung Yong SY. Park, Jeong-Rae JR. Cho, Sung Tae ST. Kim, Young-Hwan YH. Park
Abstract: Prestressed concrete (PSC) is one of the most reliable, durable and widely used construction materials, which overcomes the weakness of concrete in tension by the introduction of a prestress force. Smart strands enabling measurement of the prestress force have recently been developed to maintain PSC structures throughout their lifetime. However, the smart strand cannot give a representative indication of the whole prestress force when used in multi-strand systems since each strand sustains a different prestress force. In this paper, the actual distribution of the prestress force in a multi-strand system is examined using elastomagnetic (EM) sensors to develop a method for tracking representative indicators of the prestress force using smart strands.


Title #692: A Review of Membrane-Based Biosensors for Pathogen Detection.
PMID: 26083229
Authors: Remko van den RV. Hurk, Stephane S. Evoy
Abstract: Biosensors are of increasing interest for the detection of bacterial pathogens in many applications such as human, animal and plant health, as well as food and water safety. Membranes and membrane-like structures have been integral part of several pathogen detection platforms. Such structures may serve as simple mechanical support, function as a part of the transduction mechanism, may be used to filter out or concentrate pathogens, and may be engineered to specifically house active proteins. This review focuses on membrane materials, their associated biosensing applications, chemical linking procedures, and transduction mechanisms. The sensitivity of membrane biosensors is discussed, and the state of the field is evaluated and summarized.


Title #693: On Designing Thermal-Aware Localized QoS Routing Protocol for in-vivo Sensor Nodes in Wireless Body Area Networks.
PMID: 26083228
Authors: Muhammad Mostafa MM. Monowar, Fuad F. Bajaber
Abstract: In this paper, we address the thermal rise and Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning issue for an intra-body Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) having in-vivo sensor nodes. We propose a thermal-aware QoS routing protocol, called TLQoS, that facilitates the system in achieving desired QoS in terms of delay and reliability for diverse traffic types, as well as avoids the formation of highly heated nodes known as hotspot(s), and keeps the temperature rise along the network to an acceptable level. TLQoS exploits modular architecture wherein different modules perform integrated operations in providing multiple QoS service with lower temperature rise. To address the challenges of highly dynamic wireless environment inside the human body. TLQoS implements potential-based localized routing that requires only local neighborhood information. TLQoS avoids routing loop formation as well as reduces the number of hop traversal exploiting hybrid potential, and tuning a configurable parameter. We perform extensive simulations of TLQoS, and the results show that TLQoS has significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.


Title #694: VIS-NIR, SWIR and LWIR Imagery for Estimation of Ground Bearing Capacity.
PMID: 26083227
Authors: Roemi R. FernÃ¡ndez, HÃ©ctor H. Montes, Carlota C. Salinas
Abstract: Ground bearing capacity has become a relevant concept for site-specific management that aims to protect soil from the compaction and the rutting produced by the indiscriminate use of agricultural and forestry machines. Nevertheless, commonly known techniques for its estimation are cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to alleviate these difficulties, this paper introduces an innovative sensory system based on Visible-Near InfraRed (VIS-NIR), Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) and Long-Wave InfraRed (LWIR) imagery and a sequential algorithm that combines a registration procedure, a multi-class SVM classifier, a K-means clustering and a linear regression for estimating the ground bearing capacity. To evaluate the feasibility and capabilities of the presented approach, several experimental tests were carried out in a sandy-loam terrain. The proposed solution offers notable benefits such as its non-invasiveness to the soil, its spatial coverage without the need for exhaustive manual measurements and its real time operation. Therefore, it can be very useful in decision making processes that tend to reduce ground damage during agricultural and forestry operations.


Title #695: Novel Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for OFDM Cognitive Radio Networks.
PMID: 26083226
Authors: Zhenguo Z. Shi, Zhilu Z. Wu, Zhendong Z. Yin, Qingqing Q. Cheng
Abstract: Spectrum sensing technology plays an increasingly important role in cognitive radio networks. Consequently, several spectrum sensing algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a new spectrum sensing algorithm "Differential Characteristics-Based OFDM (DC-OFDM)" for detecting OFDM signal on account of differential characteristics. We put the primary value on channel gain Æ around zero to detect the presence of primary user. Furthermore, utilizing the same method of differential operation, we improve two traditional OFDM sensing algorithms (cyclic prefix and pilot tones detecting algorithms), and propose a "Differential Characteristics-Based Cyclic Prefix (DC-CP)" detector and a "Differential Characteristics-Based Pilot Tones (DC-PT)" detector, respectively. DC-CP detector is based on auto-correlation vector to sense the spectrum, while the DC-PT detector takes the frequency-domain cross-correlation of PT as the test statistic to detect the primary user. Moreover, the distributions of the test statistics of the three proposed methods have been derived. Simulation results illustrate that all of the three proposed methods can achieve good performance under low signal to noise ratio (SNR) with the presence of timing delay. Specifically, the DC-OFDM detector gets the best performance among the presented detectors. Moreover, both of the DC-CP and DC-PT detector achieve significant improvements compared with their corresponding original detectors.

Abstract: To the Editor: Monteleone and colleagues (March 19 issue)(1) show encouraging results regarding the use of mongersen, an oral antisense SMAD7 oligonucleotide, for the treatment of Crohn's disease. SMAD7 protein binds the transforming growth factor (TGF) Î²1 receptor, with concomitant inhibition of antiinflammatory TGF-Î² signaling. Mongersen-mediated reduction of SMAD7 protein through the degradation of its messenger RNA is therefore an attractive strategy for restoring TGF-Î² signaling.

Abstract: Background Combined immunodeficiencies are marked by inborn errors of T-cell immunity in which the T cells that are present are quantitatively or functionally deficient. Impaired humoral immunity is also common. Patients have severe infections, autoimmunity, or both. The specific molecular, cellular, and clinical features of many types of combined immunodeficiencies remain unknown. Methods We performed genetic and cellular immunologic studies involving five unrelated children with early-onset invasive bacterial and viral infections, lymphopenia, and defective T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell responses. Two patients died early in childhood; after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, the other three had normalization of T-cell function and clinical improvement. Results We identified biallelic mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2) in these five patients. RAC1 activation was impaired in the T cells. Chemokine-induced migration and actin polymerization were defective in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells. NK-cell degranulation was also affected. Interferon-Î± and interferon-Î» production by peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was diminished after viral infection. Moreover, in DOCK2-deficient fibroblasts, viral replication was increased and virus-induced cell death was enhanced; these conditions were normalized by treatment with interferon alfa-2b or after expression of wild-type DOCK2. Conclusions Autosomal recessive DOCK2 deficiency is a new mendelian disorder with pleiotropic defects of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. Children with clinical features of combined immunodeficiencies, especially with early-onset, invasive infections, may have this condition.

Abstract: Electrospun carbon nanofibres (CNFs) containing CNTs were produced by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. This material was evaluated as a bioelectrode for biofuel cell applications after covalent grafting of laccase. Bis-pyrene-modified ABTS was used as a plug to wire laccase to the nanofibres leading to a maximum current density of 100 Î¼A cm(-2).


Title #720: Evaluating the PAS-SIM model using a passive air sampler calibration study for pesticides.
PMID: 26083201
Authors: AndrÃ©s RamÃ­rez AR. Restrepo, Stephen J SJ. Hayward, James M JM. Armitage, Frank F. Wania
Abstract: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a model for simulating the uptake of various pesticides on passive air samplers (PAS). From 2006-2007 a series of PAS using XAD-resin were deployed at Egbert, a rural agricultural site in southern Ontario, Canada, to measure the uptake of pesticides for time periods ranging from two months to one year. A continuous increase in sequestered amounts was observed for most pesticides, except for trifluralin and pendimethalin, which could conceivably be subject to substantial degradation inside the sampler. Continuous low-volume active air samples taken during the same period, along with data on weather conditions, allowed for the simulation of the uptake of the pesticides using the model (PAS-SIM). The modelled accumulation of pesticides on the PAS over the deployment period was in good agreement with the experimental data in most cases (i.e., within a factor of two) providing insight into the uptake kinetics of this type of sampler in the field. Passive sampling rates (PSR, m(3) d(-1)) were determined from the empirical data generated for this study using three different methods and compared with the PSRs generated by the model. Overall, the PAS-SIM model, which is capable of accounting for the influence of temperature and wind variations on PSRs, provided reasonable results that range between the three empirical approaches employed and well-established literature values. Further evaluation and application of the PAS-SIM model to explore the potential spatial and temporal variability in PAS uptake kinetics is warranted, particularly for established monitoring sites where detailed meteorological data are more likely to be available.


Title #721: NMR structural determination of unique invertebrate glycosaminoglycans endowed with medical properties.
PMID: 26083200
Authors: Vitor H VH. Pomin
Abstract: Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are sulfated polysaccharides of complex structure endowed with numerous biomedical functions. Although ubiquitously distributed in vertebrates, GAGs can also occur in certain terrestrial or marine invertebrates. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been the analytical technique mostly employed in structural characterization of GAGs from any source. This review aims at illustrating the application of NMR in structural determination of few representative invertebrate GAG examples of unique structures and endowed with therapeutic actions. They are the holothurian fucosylated chondroitin sulfate, the acharan sulfate isolated from the snail Achatina fulica, the dermatan sulfates with distinct sulfation patterns extracted from ascidian species, the sulfated glucuronic acid-containing heparan sulfate isolated from the gastropode Nodipecten nodosum, and the hybrid heparin/heparan sulfate molecule obtained from the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. These invertebrate GAGs exhibit distinct structures when compared to those extracted from mammalian GAGs. The distinct structures of the invertebrate GAGs lead also to different mechanisms of actions as compared to the mammalian GAG standards. Invertebrate GAGs comprise promising therapeutic candidates in fights against diseases. Solution NMR has been playing a pivotal role in this carbohydrate-based drug research, discovery and development.


Title #722: Structure of the O-specific polysaccharide from the legume endosymbiotic bacterium Ochrobactrum cytisi strain ESC1(T).

Abstract: The O-specific polysaccharide was obtained from the lipopolysaccharide of the legume-endosymbiotic bacterium Ochrobactrum cytisi strain ESC1(T) and studied by chemical analyses and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The polysaccharide was found to have a disaccharide repeating unit containing Î±-d-fucose and Î²-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine residues connected via (1â3)-glycosidic bonds, resulting in the following structure: â3)-Î±-d-Fucp-(1â3)-Î²-d-GalpNAc-(1â The d-GalpNAc residue was nonstoichiometrically substituted with a 4-O-methyl group (â¼10%) or with a 4,6-O-(1-carboxy)-ethylidene residue (pyruvyl group) (â¼10%).


Title #723: Fluorescence Characteristics of Benzoyloxymethylanthracene Donor Acceptor Systems.
PMID: 26083198
Authors: Dhammike D. Dissanayake, Dayal P DP. De Costa
Abstract: A theoretical investigation on fluorescence properties of benzoyloxymethylanthracene derivatives containing different groups (OCH3, CH3, H, CF3, F, CN and NO2) as substituent on the phenyl ring is reported. Electron transfer rate constants for the molecules were calculated using Marcus theory. Theoretical electron transfer rate constants agreed with experimentally observed trend of fluorescence quenching. Large electron transfer rate constants were obtained for molecules containing strongly electron withdrawing groups as the substituent on the phenyl ring. Calculations were conducted at Hartree Fock and Density functional (HF/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-31G(d)) levels of theory. Density functional theory predicted spurious charge transfer excited states for molecules containing NO2, CN and CF3 as the substituent on the phenyl ring. Key words: Fluorescence, quenching, benzoyloxymethylanthracene, electron transfer, charge transfer, excited state.


Title #724: Amburana cearensis leaf extract maintains survival and promotes in vitro development of ovine secondary follicles.

Abstract: The antioxidant properties of Amburana cearensis extract may be a useful substitute for standard cell culture medium. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this extract, with or without supplementation, on in vitro survival and development of sheep isolated secondary follicles. After collection of the ovaries, secondary follicles were isolated and cultured for 18 days in Î±-MEM+ supplemented with bovine serum albumin, insulin, transferrin, selenium, glutamine, hypoxanthine and ascorbic acid (control medium) or into medium composed of different concentrations of A. cearensis extract without supplements (Amb 0.1; 0.2 or 0.4 mg/ml) or A. cearensis extract supplemented with the same substances described above for Î±-MEM+ supplementation. The A. cearensis supplemented medium was named Amb 0.1+; 0.2+ or 0.4+ mg/ml. There were more morphologically normal follicles in Amb 0.1 or Amb 0.4 mg/ml than in the control medium (Î±-MEM+) after 18 days of culture. Moreover, the percentage of antrum formation was significantly higher in Amb 0.1 or Amb 0.2 mg/ml than in Î±-MEM+ and Amb 0.1+ mg/ml, and similar to the other treatments. All A. cearensis extract media induced a progressive and significant increase in follicular diameter throughout the culture period. In conclusion, this study showed that 0.1 mg/ml of this extract, without supplementation, maintains follicular survival and promotes the development of ovine isolated secondary follicles in vitro. This extract can be an alternative culture medium for preantral follicle development.


Title #725: Development and Application of O-(Trimethylsilyl)aryl Fluorosulfates for the Synthesis of Arynes.
PMID: 26083196
Authors: Qiao Q. Chen, Hongmei H. Yu, Zhaoqing Z. Xu, Li L. Lin, Xianxing X. Jiang, Rui R. Wang
Abstract: A class of o-(trimethylsilyl)aryl fluorosulfates was synthesized by a concise method and successfully used as aryne precursors for the first time. Different trapping agents such as azides, furans, and acyl acetoacetates could successfully react with the aryne precursors under mild conditions with good to excellent yields.


Title #726: "Popeye muscle" morphology in OBPI elbow flexion contracture.
PMID: 26083195
Authors: Christopher J CJ. Coroneos, Zeev V ZV. Maizlin, Carol C. DeMatteo, Deborah D. Gjertsen, James R JR. Bain
Abstract: The pathophysiology of elbow flexion contracture (EFC) in obstetrical brachial plexus injury (OBPI) is not established. In basic science models, neonatal denervation leads to impaired muscle growth. In clinical studies, diminished growth is correlated with extent of denervation, and improved with surgical repair. In EFC, the biceps are clinically short and round vs the contralateral size, termed the "Popeye muscle". The objective of this study was to determine if the biceps morphology (muscle belly and tendon length) in arms with EFC secondary to OBPI is different vs the contralateral.


Title #727: Near-Unity Internal Quantum Efficiency of Luminescent Silicon Nanocrystals with Ligand Passivation.
PMID: 26083194
Authors: Fatemeh F. Sangghaleh, Ilya I. Sychugov, Zhenyu Z. Yang, Jonathan G C JG. Veinot, Jan J. Linnros
Abstract: Spectrally-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decays were measured for samples of colloidal, ligand-passivated silicon nanocrystals. These samples have PL emission energies with peak positions in the range of ~ 1.4-1.8 eV and quantum yields in between ~ 30-70%. Their ensemble PL decays are characterized by a stretched-exponential decay with a dispersion factor of ~ 0.8, which changes to an almost mono-exponential character at fixed detection energies. The dispersion factors and decay rates for various detection energies were extracted from spectrally-resolved curves using a mathematical approach which excluded the effect of homogenous linewidth broadening. Since non-radiative recombination would introduce a random lifetime variation, leading to a stretched exponential decay for an ensemble, we conclude that the observed mono-exponential decay in size-selected ensembles signifies negligible non-radiative transitions of a similar strength as the radiative one. This conjecture is further supported as extracted decay rates agree with radiative rates reported in the literature, suggesting 100% internal quantum efficiency over a broad range of emission wavelengths. The apparent differences in the quantum yields can then be explained by a varying fraction of "dark" or blinking nanocrystals.


Title #728: Crystal orientation modulated exchange bias in orthorhombic-YMnO3/La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 multiferroic heterostructures.
PMID: 26083193
Authors: Dongxing D. Zheng, Junlu J. Gong, Chao C. Jin, Peng P. Li, Hai-Li HL. Bai
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the all oxide multiferroic heterostructures composed of orthorhombic YMnO3 ï¼YMOï¼with E-type antiferromagnetic and double-exchange ferromagnetic (FM) La0.6Sr0.4MnO3ï¼LSMOï¼ were studied. An orientation modulated exchange bias effect, which is related to the interfacial Mn-O-Mn bond angle, was discovered. Due to the large bond angle in YMO/LSMO(100) heterostructures, a strong exchange coupling at the interface is formed. This strong exchange coupling sustains a FM phase in YMO at the interface region. The FM phase with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy contributes to the vertical shift and exchange bias effect in (100) orientation heterostructures. When LSMO (110) and (111) were layered with YMO, the Mn-O-Mn bond angle was reduced; leading to a weakened exchange coupling at the interface, and only a relatively small exchange bias at low temperatures was visible.

Title #730: On the relationships among genetic, structural and functional properties of rice starch.
PMID: 26083191
Authors: Xiangli X. Kong, Yaling Y. Chen, Ping P. Zhu, Zhongquan Z. Sui, Harold H. Corke, Jinsong J. Bao
Abstract: We determined the relationships among the structural properties, in vitro digestibility and genetic factors in starches of 14 rice cultivars. Weight-based chain-length distributions in amylopectin ranged from 18.07% to 24.71% (fa, DP 6-12), 45.01% to 55.67% (fb1, DP 13-24), 12.72% to 14.05% (fb2, DP 25-36) and 10.80 to 20.72% (fb3, DP > 36), respectively. The contents of rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) ranged from 78.5% to 87.5%, 1.2% to 6.0% and 10.1% to 18.0%, respectively. AAC was negatively correlated with RDS content, but positively correlated with RS content in rice starch. The proportion of short chains in amylopectin was positively correlated with RDS. Starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) gene controls the degree of crystallinity, the amount of fa chains of amylopectin. SSIIIa gene controls the amount of fb1 chains. Wx gene controls the amount of fraction I (FrI) and FrIIa fractionated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), RDS, and RS. Starch debranching enzyme isoamylase II (ISA2) gene also controls the RDS, which may suggest that RDS was also affected by amylopectin structure although no correlation between them was found. This study indicated that genetics (i.e. starch biosynthesis related genes) controls structural properties of starch, and both amylose content and amylopectin fine structure determined functional properties of rice starch (i.e. the digestion), each in a different way. Understanding the 'genetics-structure-function' relationships in rice starches will assist plant breeders and food processors to develop new rice varieties and functional foods.


Title #731: Serotonin Synthesis and Reuptake in Social Anxiety Disorder: A Positron Emission Tomography Study.

Abstract: Serotonin is involved in negative affect, but whether anxiety syndromes, such as social anxiety disorder (SAD), are characterized by an overactive or underactive serotonin system has not been established. Serotonin 1A autoreceptors, which inhibit serotonin synthesis and release, are downregulated in SAD, and serotonin transporter availability might be increased; however, presynaptic serotonin activity has not been evaluated extensively.


Title #732: Spray-Dried Multiscale Nano-biocomposites Containing Living Cells.

Abstract: Three-dimensional encapsulation of cells within nanostructured silica gels or matrices enables applications as diverse as biosensors, microbial fuel cells, artificial organs, and vaccines; it also allows the study of individual cell behaviors. Recent progress has improved the performance and flexibility of cellular encapsulation, yet there remains a need for robust scalable processes. Here, we report a spray-drying process enabling the large-scale production of functional nano-biocomposites (NBCs) containing living cells within ordered 3D lipid-silica nanostructures. The spray-drying process is demonstrated to work with multiple cell types and results in dry powders exhibiting a unique combination of properties including highly ordered 3D nanostructure, extended lipid fluidity, tunable macromorphologies and aerodynamic diameters, and unexpectedly high physical strength. Nanoindentation of the encasing nanostructure revealed a Young's modulus and hardness of 13 and 1.4 GPa, respectively. We hypothesized this high strength would prevent cell growth and force bacteria into viable but not culturable (VBNC) states. In concordance with the VBNC state, cellular ATP levels remained elevated even over eight months. However, their ability to undergo resuscitation and enter growth phase greatly decreased with time in the VBNC state. A quantitative method of determining resuscitation frequencies was developed and showed that, after 36 weeks in a NBC-induced VBNC, less than 1 in 10â¯000 cells underwent resuscitation. The NBC platform production of large quantities of VBNC cells is of interest for research in bacterial persistence and screening of drugs targeting such cells. NBCs may also enable long-term preservation of living cells for applications in cell-based sensing and the packaging and delivery of live-cell vaccines.


Title #733: Dioxins and furans in breast milk: a case study of mothers from southern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
PMID: 26083184
Authors: Aldo Pacheco AP. Ferreira, Maria de FÃ¡tima Ramos MF. Moreira
Abstract: A study of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) was conducted in a pooled sample of breast milk from 27 primiparous mothers living in 12 locations in the meso-region industrial area of southern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between August 2012 and July 2013. Questionnaires with questions regarding food habits, social and economic conditions and places of dwelling were applied. Milk was collected between four and six weeks after delivery from mothers were breast-feeding only one infant. The toxic equivalency (TEQ) of PCDD/Fs, and dl-PCBs were 10.6, 4.77, 6.96 TEQ pg/g, respectively. The understanding and identification of pollution sources may be helpful for applying better counter measures against breast milk dioxin contamination. It is important for pregnant women to have a diet that is as free as possible from chemical contaminants. Further research must be undertaken in the context of epidemiological investigations to more accurately assess the effects of these compounds. The background contamination by PCDD/Fs, and dl-PCBs in mothers living at industrial area in Rio de Janeiro is lower than that generally found in industrialized countries.


Title #734: [Treatment of childhood injuries and violence in public emergency services].
PMID: 26083183

Abstract: This study aimed to analyze the profile of treatment for accidents and violence involving children under 10 years of age in Brazil in the year 2011. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in 71 emergency services in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), located in the national capital and 24 state capitals. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health's system of sentinel surveillance services for Violence and Accidents (VIVA Survey). The highest proportion of injuries (67.4%) occurred inside the child's home. Among unintentional injuries, falls were the most frequent (52.4%), followed by running into objects or persons (21.8%) and traffic injuries (10.9%), especially as passengers (bicycles were an important means of transportation involved in the injuries). The vast majority of unintentional injuries are avoidable, and educational measures should be adopted, especially with parents, teachers, the community, and health workers, calling attention to the risks and the adoption of safe behaviors in the home, at school, and in leisure-time activities. Cases of violence are subject to mandatory reporting, and prompt measures should be taken to protect victims.


Title #735: [Food insecurity and overweight in first grade students in the municipal school system in SÃ£o Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil].

Abstract: This cross-sectional school-based study in SÃ£o Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, evaluated the association between food insecurity and overweight in first grade students in the municipal elementary school system. A total of 2,369 students were invited to participate, of whom 847 were examined, and of these, 782 had data available on weight and height. Dietary data were obtained from a parent or guardian. Food insecurity was measured by the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA). Data on weight and height were provided by the Nutrition Service of the Municipal Department of Education. Prevalence rates for overweight and food insecurity were 38.1% and 45.1%, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, children with food insecurity had 22% lower odds of overweight. Notwithstanding the inverse association between the exposure and outcome, this sample showed high rates of food insecurity and overweight, revealing a complex relationship and indicating that further research is needed to understand it. Robust public policies are critical for addressing these conditions.


Title #736: Trends in child labor and the impact on health in adulthood in Brazil from 1998 to 2008.
PMID: 26083181
Authors: Marislei M. Nishijima, AndrÃ© Portela Fernandes de AP. Souza, FlÃ¡via Mori FM. Sarti
Abstract: There is little evidence in Brazil on the impact of child labor on health status in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate trends in child labor in Brazil and estimate the long-term effects of child labor on the health of Brazilian adults, using nationally representative databases (Brazilian National Household Sample Survey) from three different years (1998, 2003, and 2008). The models were based on a two-stage linear equation and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The results suggest that child labor has declined in Brazil, although the data still show patterns of early entry into the country's labor market. Regardless of the type of work, child labor adversely affected health outcomes in adulthood, both directly (impacts on health outcomes) and indirectly (losses in educational attainment). Child labor places a long-term burden on Brazilians, jeopardizing the formation of human capital through negative impacts on health outcomes in adulthood.


Title #737: Socio-demographic correlates of leisure time physical activity among Portuguese adults.
PMID: 26083180
Authors: Adilson A. Marques, JoÃ£o J. Martins, Hugo H. Sarmento, Madalena M. Ramos, JosÃ© J. Diniz, Francisco Carreiro da FC. Costa
Abstract: This study aimed to identify socio-demographic correlates of leisure time physical activity among Portuguese adults. Subjects aged 31-60 years (1,076 males, 1,383 females) were categorized into two groups according to recommended physical activities ranging from â¥ 10 or < 10 MET.hours.week-1. Leisure time physical activity data was self-reported, including activities, duration of each session and frequency. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were applied to the results. Among men, having a high socioeconomic status (OR = 1.89; 95%CI: 1.30-2.76; p = 0.001) was associated with attaining the recommended level of physical activity. For women, middle education levels were associated with physical activity (OR = 1.36; 95%CI: 1.01-1.85). Moreover, middle socioeconomic status (OR = 1.45; 95%CI: 0.80-1.91; p = 0.009) was also positively associated with meeting physical activities recommendations in the unadjusted analysis. Men and women had different patterns of socio-demographic correlates. An intervention designed to improve the levels of physical activity among Portuguese adults may take these correlates into account.

PMID: 26083179
Authors: Susana Cararo SC. Confortin, MaruÃ­ Weber Corseuil MW. Giehl, Danielle Ledur DL. Antes, Ione Jayce Ceola IJ. Schneider, Eleonora E. d'Orsi
Abstract: The objective was to identify factors associated with positive self-rated health in the elderly in FlorianÃ³polis, Santa Catarina State, in the South of Brazil. This population-based cross-sectional study evaluated 1,705 elderly. Self-rated health was classified as positive (very good or good) or negative (fair, poor, and very poor). Crude and adjusted Poisson regression was used to identify associated factors. Prevalence of positive self-rated health was 51.2%, associated with male gender (PR = 1.13), more than 5 years of schooling, moderate (PR = 1.33) or high alcohol intake (PR = 1.37), leisure-time activity (PR = 1.20), Internet use (PR = 1.21), fewer diseases, mild/moderate dependence (PR = 2.20) or no dependence (PR = 2.67), no falls (PR = 1.19), and non-use of polypharmacy (PR = 1.27). Several modifiable factors were identified that can affect positive self-rated health in the elderly and contribute to the development of strategies to improve their quality of life.

Abstract: Social, individual, and programmatic vulnerability of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the context of the HIV epidemic and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) is a reality in many countries. The survey Behavior, Attitudes, Practices, and Prevalence of HIV and Syphilis in Men Who Have Sex with Men in 10 Brazilian Cities selected 383 MSM in the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil, using the respondent driven sampling (RDS) technique. Individual vulnerability early sexual initiation (51%), average of eight sex partners, and unprotected receptive anal sex with casual (32%) and steady partners (45%) and positive rapid tests HIV (6.5%) and syphilis (9%). Social vulnerability young adults (80%), black race/skin color (91%), mean monthly family income of BRL 1,000.00, and personal history of discrimination (57%). Programmatic factors no previous HIV test (63%) and no access to lubricant gel (88%). The study showed a profile of vulnerability and the urgent need for interventions and STI prevention in the MSM population in Salvador, in addition to high prevalence rates for HIV and syphilis.

Abstract: This study aimed to assess social and clinical factors associated with the fact that older adults (â¥ 60 years) go out of their homes. The study interviewed 5,898 older adults identified through home visits, randomly selected in 59 cities in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between the outcome and independent variables. Factors associated with going out were being men, younger and married, presence of arthrosis, ease in performing specific activities, and good self-rated health. Heart disease was a negative factor for going out. Given the importance of social activity for quality of life and the World Health Organization policy for active aging, it is extremely important to consider clinical conditions that allow the older adults to remain active in the community. Studies like this can help to adjust public policies for the elderly, especially acting on modifiable clinical and functional conditions.

Abstract: This study focused on the association between socio-demographic characteristics and three sedentary behaviors among industrial workers in Brazil. Data were analyzed on 47,477 workers from 24 Brazilian states, collected by questionnaires from 2006 to 2008. Individual and simultaneous presence of â¥ 4 hours of TV time per day, commuting by car or motorcycle, and sitting most of the time at work were investigated, as well as associations between these behaviors and gender, age, schooling, and family income. Simple and multiple binary logistic regression were used. Older workers and those with more schooling and higher income had increased odds of presenting two or all of the three target behaviors. Associations between gender and sedentary behaviors depend on the specific behavior. Such information can be useful for planning interventions to reduce sedentary behavior, with better targeting and more effectiveness in reaching different population subgroups.El objetivo fue investigar la asociaciÃ³n entre aspectos sociodemogrÃ¡ficos y tres comportamientos sedentarios en trabajadores de la industria en Brasil. Se analizaron datos de 47.477 trabajadores de industrias de 24 Unidades Federativas de Brasil, obtenidas por cuestionario de 2006 a 2008. Se investigÃ³ la presencia individual y simultÃ¡nea de ver televisiÃ³n â¥ 4 horas/dÃ­a, desplazamiento en coche o moto para el trabajo y pasar la mayor parte del tiempo sentado en el trabajo, asÃ­ como la asociaciÃ³n de esos comportamientos sedentarios con sexo, edad, renta familiar mensual y nivel de escolaridad. Para eso, se utilizÃ³ la regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica binaria simple y mÃºltiple. Trabajadores con mÃ¡s edad, escolaridad y renta tuvieron mayor razÃ³n de oportunidades de presentar dos de los tres comportamientos sedentarios investigados, asÃ­ como la presencia simultÃ¡nea de ellos. Las asociaciones entre sexo y comportamientos sedentarios dependen del comportamiento investigado. Tales informaciones pueden ser Ãºtiles para planear acciones de reducciÃ³n de comportamientos sedentarios mejor dirigidas y mÃ¡s eficientes en el alcance a diferentes subgrupos de la poblaciÃ³n.


Title #742: [Use of different criteria to assess inadequate prenatal care: a population-based study in Southern Brazil].
PMID: 26083175
Authors: Janaina SalomÃ£o JS. Saavedra, Juraci A JA. Cesar
Abstract: This study measured the prevalence of inadequate prenatal care and identified associated factors using different criteria in postpartum women in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in 2010. A standardized questionnaire was applied within 24 hours after delivery to all mothers of children born in the two local hospitals. We used the chi-square test to compare proportions and Poisson regression with robust variance in the multivariate analysis. The study interviewed 2,395 mothers (97.2% of the total). The rates of inadequate prenatal care were 28%, 27%, and 58% according to the criteria proposed by Takeda, Coimbra et al., and Silveira et al., respectively, with large differences across categories. Poor mothers showed the highest prevalence ratio for inadequate prenatal care. After adjustment, nearly all the model's variables were significantly associated with inadequate care according to the Takeda and Coimbra et al. criteria, but few were associated when the Silveira et al. criteria were used. The study showed that the criteria proposed by Silveira et al. were more robust, and that it is necessary to improve quality of prenatal care, especially for poor mothers.

Abstract: This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between poor quality of sleep and adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 389 Peruvian patients with HIV/AIDS. Poor quality of sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and adherence with the CEAT-VIH (Peruvian adaptation). A Poisson generalized linear model with robust standard errors was used to estimate prevalence ratios and 95%CI. A crude model showed that mild, moderate, and severe poor quality of sleep were associated with inadequate treatment adherence. In the adjusted model for variables associated in the bivariate analysis or variables theoretically associated with adherence, only moderate/severe poor quality of sleep remained associated (PR = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.17-1.54; and PR = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.16-1.57, respectively). The study concluded that moderate/severe poor quality of sleep was independently associated with adherence to HAART. Assessing quality of sleep may be helpful in the comprehensive evaluation of HIV patients.


Title #744: Self-reported physical inactivity and health complaints: a cross-sectional study of Lithuanian adolescent schoolgirls.
PMID: 26083173
Authors: Romualdas R. Malinauskas, Vilija V. Malinauskaiene
Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the associations between physical inactivity and health complaints in relation to posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, behavioral and nutritional factors, and sense of coherence (SOC) in eighth-grade girls enrolled in secondary schools in Kaunas, Lithuania. A random sample of girls (N = 862) was interviewed anonymously on health complaints, physical activity level, PTS symptoms, Antonovsky's SOC scale, health behaviors, and dietary patterns. All health complaints were significantly associated with physical inactivity. Crude odds ratio (OR) for physical inactivity and health complaints was 1.67 (95%CI: 1.09-2.56); after adjusting for PTS symptoms, the OR decreased to 1.57 (95%CI: 0.95-2.45); further adjustment for smoking, daily alcohol intake, daily consumption of fresh vegetables, and SOC decreased the OR to 1.25 (95%CI: 0.76-2.04). The effect of PTS symptoms and sense of coherence remained stable after all adjustments. The significant association between physical inactivity and health complaints was mediated by PTS symptoms.

Abstract: Leprosy is hyperendemic in the State of Tocantins, Brazil. The aim of the study was to analyze trends in leprosy indicators in Tocantins from 2001 to 2012, based on analysis of data from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), including incident cases living in Tocantins. The study calculated leprosy indicators and analyzed time trends using polynomial regression. There was a significant downward trend in overall case detection (R2 = 0.40; p < 0.05) and proportion of paucibacillary cases (R2 = 0.81). Detection rates remained stable in individuals < 15 years (R2 = 0.48; p > 0.05) and cases with grade 2 physical disability (R2 = 0.37; p > 0.05), as did the proportion of grade 2 cases (R2 = 0.49; p > 0.05). There were significant increases in the proportions of cases with grade 1 disability (R2 = 0.82; p < 0.05) and multibacillary cases (R2 = 0.81; p < 0.05). Tocantins has regions with high transmission and late diagnosis of leprosy, indicating heterogeneous dissemination of the disease in the time trend analysis.

Abstract: The This qualitative study aimed to analyze the development and implementation of the Brazilian National Policy on Health Data and Information Technology (NPIIH). We analyzed documents and applied an online questionnaire to the experts involved in developing the policy. The data were submitted to content analysis using the categorical thematic modality. The PNIIS is the target of debate and proposals at various levels. Provisions have appeared in parallel to regulate measures on health data and information technology. Community participation in developing this policy and the convergence of laws, standards, resolutions, and policy-making levels in a common and broadly acknowledged and enforced policy are challenges, in addition to linking the public and private sectors. The study concludes that the National Policy on Health Data and Information Technology is making gradual progress, predominantly in theoretical debates, revisions, and updates. There are numerous challenges for its implementation and a prevailing need for legitimation.


Title #747: An evaluation of coordination relationships during earthquake emergency rescue using entropy theory.
PMID: 26083170
Authors: Huang H. Rong, Liang L. Xuedong, Zeng Z. Guizhi, Ye Y. Yulin, Wang W. Da
Abstract: Emergency rescue after an earthquake is complex work which requires the participation of relief and social organizations. Studying earthquake emergency coordination efficiency can not only help rescue organizations to define their own rescue missions, but also strengthens inter-organizational communication and collaboration tasks, improves the efficiency of emergency rescue, and reduces loss. In this paper, collaborative entropy is introduced to study earthquake emergency rescue operations. To study the emergency rescue coordination relationship, collaborative matrices and collaborative entropy functions are established between emergency relief work and relief organizations, and the collaborative efficiency of the emergency rescue elements is determined based on this entropy function. Finally, the Lushan earthquake is used as an example to evaluate earthquake emergency rescue coordination efficiency.


Title #748: [Functional capacity in the elderly: analyzing questions on mobility and basic and instrumental activities of daily living using Item Response Theory].
PMID: 26083169
Authors: Cibele Comini CC. CÃ©sar, Juliana Vaz de Melo JV. Mambrini, Fabiane Ribeiro FR. Ferreira, Maria Fernanda MF. Lima-Costa
Abstract: This article aims to evaluate the items used to measure functional capacity in the 2010 Health Survey in Greater Metropolitan Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, using Item Response Theory. We analyzed the scale's dimensionality, the items' position and discriminatory power, and the precision of the functional capacity estimate. The study was based on a sample of 2,174 individuals aged 60 to 99 years, 61% of whom were women, with a median of 4 years of schooling. The instrument with 21 items (4 response options) showed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.98. Factor analysis identified one factor that explained 92% of the variability between the items. The results indicated: (i) redundancy in items; (ii) precise estimation of functional capacity only for elderly below the median on the scale; and (iii) inability of the elderly to differentiate between response options. The analysis suggests the need to discuss items included in the instrument in order to cover a wider range of the scale and seek more appropriate response options.

Abstract: The Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents (ERICA) aims to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome in adolescents (12-17 years) enrolled in public and private schools of the 273 municipalities with over 100,000 inhabitants in Brazil. The study population was stratified into 32 geographical strata (27 capitals and five sets with other municipalities in each macro-region of the country) and a sample of 1,251 schools was selected with probability proportional to size. In each school three combinations of shift (morning and afternoon) and grade were selected, and within each of these combinations, one class was selected. All eligible students in the selected classes were included in the study. The design sampling weights were calculated by the product of the reciprocals of the inclusion probabilities in each sampling stage, and were later calibrated considering the projections of the numbers of adolescents enrolled in schools located in the geographical strata by sex and age.

Title #751: Small-sized granules of biphasic bone substitutes support fast implant bed vascularization.
PMID: 26083163

Abstract: The present study investigated the influence of granule size of two biphasic bone substitutes (BoneCeramicÂ® 400-700Â Î¼Â m and 500-1000Â Î¼Â m) on the induction of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) and implant bed vascularization in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Furthermore, degradation mechanisms and particle phagocytosis of both materials were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both granule types induced tissue reactions involving primarily mononuclear cells and only small numbers of MNGCs. Higher numbers of MNGCs were detected in the group with small granules starting on day 30, while higher vascularization was observed only at day 10 in this group. TEM analysis revealed that both mono- and multinucleated cells were involved in the phagocytosis of the materials. Additionally, the results allowed recognition of the MNGCs as the foreign body giant cell phenotype. Histomorphometrical analysis of the size of phagocytosed particles showed no differences between the two granule types. The results indicate that granule size seems to have impact on early implant bed vascularization and also on the induction of MNGCs in the late phase of the tissue reaction. Furthermore, the results revealed that a synthetic bone substitute material can induce tissue reactions similar to those of some xenogeneic materials, thus pointing to a need to elucidate their "ideal" physical characteristics. The results also show that granule size in the range studied did not alter phagocytosis by mononuclear cells. Finally, the investigation substantiates the differentiation of material-induced MNGCs, which are of the foreign body giant cell type.


Title #752: Automatic indicator dilution curve extraction in dynamic-contrast enhanced imaging using spectral clustering.

Abstract: Indicator dilution theory provides a framework for the measurement of several cardiovascular parameters. Recently, dynamic imaging and contrast agents have been proposed to apply the method in a minimally invasive way. However, the use of contrast-enhanced sequences requires the definition of regions of interest (ROIs) in the dynamic image series; a time-consuming and operator dependent task, commonly performed manually. In this work, we propose a method for the automatic extraction of indicator dilution curves, exploiting the time domain correlation between pixels belonging to the same region. Individual time intensity curves were projected into a low dimensional subspace using principal component analysis; subsequently, clustering was performed to identify the different ROIs. The method was assessed on clinically available DCE-MRI and DCE-US recordings, comparing the derived IDCs with those obtained manually. The robustness to noise of the proposed approach was shown on simulated data. The tracer kinetic parameters derived on real images were in agreement with those obtained from manual annotation. The presented method is a clinically useful preprocessing step prior to further ROI-based cardiac quantifications.


Title #753: The Prognostic Role of Ki-67/MIB-1 in Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinomas: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 26083161
Authors: Ye Y. Lei, Zengbo Z. Li, Lin L. Qi, Shiyu S. Tong, Bin B. Li, Wei W. He, Minfeng M. Chen
Abstract: Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC) constitute 5% of urothelial malignancies. Prognostic biomarkers would allow lower-risk surgical approaches for less aggressive UTUCs. One biomarker -- Ki-67/mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Ki-67/MIB-1) -- shows promise in UTUC, but there have been conflicting findings regarding its prognostic role. The systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the prognostic value of Ki-67/MIB-1 in UTUC in terms of UTUC-specific mortality, five-year disease-free survival, and five-year overall survival (including disease-specific survival).

Title #757: Interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C.
PMID: 26083155
Authors: J A JA. Gutierrez, E J EJ. Lawitz, F. F. Poordad
Abstract: The treatment environment for chronic hepatitis C has undergone a revolution, particularly in genotype 1. Gone are interferon-based therapy and its associated tolerability challenges, inadequate response rates and numerous baseline factors that affect response to therapy. New and emerging treatment regimens employ all-oral combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents, and results of clinical trials suggest that these regimens routinely achieve cure rates >90%, even in patients who failed prior interferon-based triple therapy. In 2015, three all-oral FDA-approved regiments will be available for genotype 1 (sofosbuvir /ledipasvir, sofosbuvir/simeprevir, and paritaprevir/r/ombitasvir/dasabuvir). Furthermore, new treatment combinations appear to be more tolerable and require shorter duration of therapy. We provide an overview of the classes of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), the clinical factors affecting their integration into combination therapies and recent findings from trials of such combination therapies in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection.


Title #758: MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in the response of rice plants to fungal elicitors.
PMID: 26083154
Authors: Patricia P. Baldrich, Sonia S. Campo, Ming-Tsung MT. Wu, Tze-Tze TT. Liu, Yue-Ie Caroline YI. Hsing, Blanca San BS. Segundo
Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have important regulatory functions in plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stress. Increasing evidence also supports that plant miRNAs contribute to immune responses to pathogens. Here, we used deep sequencing of small RNA libraries for global identification of rice miRNAs that are regulated by fungal elicitors. We also describe 9 previously uncharacterized miRNAs in rice. Combined small RNA and degradome analyses revealed regulatory networks enriched in elicitor-regulated miRNAs supported by the identification of their corresponding target genes. Specifically, we identified an important number of miRNA/target gene pairs involved in small RNA pathways, including miRNA, heterochromatic and trans-acting siRNA pathways. We present evidence for miRNA/target gene pairs implicated in hormone signaling and cross-talk among hormone pathways having great potential in regulating rice immunity. Furthermore, we describe miRNA-mediated regulation of Conserved-Peptide upstream Open Reading Frame (CPuORF)-containing genes in rice, which suggests the existence of a novel regulatory network that integrates miRNA and CPuORF functions in plants. The knowledge gained in this study will help in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in rice immunity and develop appropriate strategies for rice protection.


Title #759: Aptamer-drug conjugates.
PMID: 26083153
Authors: Guizhi G. Zhu, Gang G. Niu, Xiaoyuan X. Chen
Abstract: Western medicine often aims to specifically treat diseased tissues or organs. However, the majority of current therapeutics failed to do so owing to their limited selectivity and the consequent "off-target" side effects. Targeted therapy aims to enhance the selectivity of therapeutic effects and reduce adverse side effects. One approach towards this goal is to utilize disease-specific ligands to guide the delivery of less-specific therapeutics, such that the therapeutic effects can be guided specifically to diseased tissues or organs. Among these ligands, aptamers, also known as chemical antibodies, have emerged over the past decades as a novel class of targeting ligands that are capable of specific binding to disease biomarkers. Compared with other types of targeting ligands, aptamers have an array of unique advantageous features, which make them promising to develop aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) for targeted therapy. In this review article, we will discuss ApDCs for targeted drug delivery in chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy, primarily of cancer.

Title #763: Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.
PMID: 26083148
Authors: Changhyun C. Choi, Seon-Hee SH. Hwang, Il Ran IR. Fang, Soon Il SI. Kwon, Sang Ryeol SR. Park, Ilpyung I. Ahn, Jung Bong JB. Kim, Duk-Ju DJ. Hwang
Abstract: WRKY proteins are transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of defense-related genes. The salicylic acid (SA)-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 (OsWRKY6) was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a (OsPR10a) by transient expression assays. A physical interaction between OsWRKY6 and W-box-like element 1 (WLE1), which positively regulates OsPR10a/probenazole induced protein 1 expression, was verified inÂ vitro. Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses. OsWRKY6-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased OsWRKY6 levels caused cell death. Salicylic acid (SA) concentrations were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in wild-type (WT) plants, and transcript levels of Oryza sativa isochorismate synthase 1 (OsICS1), which encodes a major enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis, were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in WT. OsWRKY6 directly bound to the OsICS1 promoter inÂ vivo. This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations. OsWRKY6 autoregulates its own expression. OsWRKY6 protein degradation is possibly regulated by ubiquitination. Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization.

Title #765: Highly Stable and Sensitive Paper Based bending Sensor Using Silver Nanowires/Layered Double Hydroxides Hybrids.
PMID: 26083146
Authors: Yong Y. Wei, Shilong S. Chen, Fucheng F. Li, Yong Y. Lin, Ying Y. Zhang, Lan L. Liu
Abstract: Highly sensitive flexible piezoresistive materials using silver nanowires (AgNWs) composites have been widely researched due to their excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Intrinsically, AgNWs tend to aggregate in polymer matrix since the intense depletion-induced interactions, which seriously influence the percolation threshold of the composites. In this study, we report a highly stable and sensitive paper based bending sensor using the AgNWs and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct a hybrid conductive network in waterborne polyurethane (WPU) that is easy to destruct and reconstruct under bending deformation. The nonconductive 2D LDH nanosheets are embedded into AgNWs network and assist dispersion of AgNWs, which depends on the hydrogen bonding between the two nanostructures. The percolation threshold of the composites decrease from 10.8 vol% (55 wt%) to 3.1 vol% (23.8 wt%) and the composites reaches a very low resistivity (10-4 Î©â¢cm) with a small amount of AgNWs (8.3 vol%) due to the dispersion improvement of AgNWs with the effect of LDH nanosheets. The as prepared conductive composites with low percolation threshold can be manufactured on paper via various methods such as rollerball pen writing, inkjet printing or screen printing. The bending sensor prepared by manufacturing the composites on paper shows low-cost, excellent conductivity, flexibility (> 3000 bending cycles), sensitivity (0.16 rad-1), fast response (120 ms) and relaxation time (105 ms) and non-toxicity. Therefore, a simple but efficient wearable sensor is developed to monitor the human motions (such as fingers and elbow joints movements) and presents good repeatability, stability and responsiveness, making the bending sensor may be meets the needs in numerous applications for robotic systems.


Title #766: A Three-Dimensional Dynamic Metal-Organic Framework with Fourfold Interpenetrating Diamondoid Networks and Selective Adsorption Properties.
PMID: 26083145
Authors: Ping P. Ju, Long L. Jiang, Tong-Bu TB. Lu
Abstract: A three-dimensional metal-organic framework (1) with fourfold interpenetrating diamondoid networks was constructed using a macrocyclic nickel(II) complex and a tetracarboxylic ligand 4,4',4â³,4â´-(cyclohexane-1,2-diyibis(azanetriyl))tetrakis(methylene)tetrabenzoic acid as building blocks. Despite the fourfold interpenetration, 1 possesses one-dimensional channels that are occupied by water and CH3CN guest molecules. Once the guest molecules were removed, the framework and pores in desolvated 1 are dynamic with large adsorption hysteresis loops, which exhibit selective gas adsorption for CO2 at 195 K over N2 and H2 at 77 K and selective adsorption for methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol over isopropanol at 298 K.


Title #767: Minimal Awareness and Stalled Uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Among at Risk, HIV-Negative, Black Men Who Have Sex with Men.
PMID: 26083143
Authors: Lisa A LA. Eaton, Daniel D DD. Driffin, Jose J. Bauermeister, Harlan H. Smith, Christopher C. Conway-Washington
Abstract: In the United States, rates of HIV infection are highest among black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective form of HIV prevention, but the uptake of this strategy has been slow since FDA approval in 2012, and it is unknown whether information about PrEP is reaching BMSM. Four hundred and thirty-six BMSM in Atlanta, GA were surveyed from January 2012 (6 months prior to PrEP approval) to March 2014 (20 months after approval). Analyses revealed no association between date of survey assessment and awareness of PrEP (20.5% were aware of PrEP before approval and 23.4% were aware after approval; OR=0.99 [0.98-1.02], p=0.952). In a multivariate model, BMSM unaware of PrEP reported lower rates of HIV testing knowledge, fewer experiences with HIV testing, and higher rates of transactional sex than BMSM who were aware of PrEP. Our findings suggest that there is limited understanding of PrEP and that there is considerable groundwork that needs to be achieved in order to reap the full benefits of PrEP. The current findings call attention to the need to both prioritize and better understand how to strengthen the bridge between medical advances and community uptake.


Title #768: Posteroventrolateral pallidotomy through implanted DBS electrodes monitored by recording local field potentials.
PMID: 26083140

Abstract: This paper describes the use of globus pallidus internus (Gpi) local field potentials recorded through pre-implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes on a patient affected by generalized dystonia. The recordings were made both before and after radiofrequency-induced posteroventrolateral bilateral stereotactic pallidotomy. LFP patterns and macroelectrode impedances were modified after the pallidotomy, along with the improvement of dystonic symptoms. After implantation, the DBS electrodes were used for subsequent bedside pallidotomies that were required by the evolution and/or persistence of symptoms. In our hands, LFPs were safe and effective in monitoring pallidotomy performed through DBS electrodes.

Title #770: Undergraduate teaching of neurosurgery - what is the current practice in the UK and is there a need for improvement?
PMID: 26083138
Authors: Kathrin J KJ. Whitehouse, Anne J AJ. Moore
Abstract: There has been concern that the move towards generalism means that specialties, such as neurosurgery, are being pushed out of the undergraduate syllabus. Surveys were created, along with the Society of British Neurological Surgeons, and sent to medical school representatives (MSRs) and neurosurgery programme directors (NPDs) in the United Kingdom (UK). 60% of MSRs and 71% of NPDs responded. Neurosurgical topics were taught by a variety of specialties, and in one medical school, a MSR said that neurosurgery was not taught at all. 83% of MSRs and 80% of NPDs said that neurosurgeons should be more involved in undergraduate education, with 70% of NPDs saying that their unit would be willing to have increased involvement. All NPDs, but only 72% of MSRs, said that neurosurgery should be taught in medical school. Those MSRs who disagreed opined that it was a postgraduate subject, and could be difficult to engage all students. The majority of MSRs and NPDs thought that neurosurgery guidelines would be useful. The most popular forms of guidance were in the forms of curriculum/guidelines, website and powerpoint presentations. It is therefore recommended that neurosurgeons, under the umbrella of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons, create national guidelines for the teaching of undergraduate students; to aid their educational colleagues and ensure that accurate, standardised teaching occurs. Care must be taken not to be over-prescriptive in these endeavours.


Title #771: Designing an operating theatre for awake procedures: A solution to improve multimodality information input.

Abstract: Many neurosurgical procedures are now performed with the patient aware in order to allow interactions between the patient and healthcare professionals. These procedures include awake brain surgery and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), lead placement for treatment of refractory chronic back and leg pain. Neurosurgical procedures under local anaesthesia require optimal intraoperative cooperation of the patient and all personnel involved in surgery. In addition to accommodating this extra source of intraoperative information all other necessary sources of data relevant to the procedure must be presented. The concept of an operating room dedicated to neurosurgical procedures performed aware and accommodating these concepts is presented, and some evidence for improvements in outcome presented, deriving from a series of patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators before and after the operating theatre was brought into service.

Abstract: Decompressive craniectomy (DC)-a potentially life-saving intervention following traumatic brain injury (TBI) with medically refractory brain swelling-once performed, surviving patients, more often than not, undergo a second procedure with cranioplasty (CP) in the future. This study analyzes complications following CP after DC, as the beneficial effects of the DC can't be extrapolated in long run over a population unless one adds into it the complications associated with the CP in the survivors of TBI.


Title #773: Characterization of dose-response for count data using a generalized MCP-Mod approach in an adaptive dose-ranging trial.
PMID: 26083135
Authors: Francois F. Mercier, Bjoern B. Bornkamp, David D. Ohlssen, Erik E. Wallstroem
Abstract: Understanding the dose-response relationship is a key objective in Phase II clinical development. Yet, designing a dose-ranging trial is a challenging task, as it requires identifying the therapeutic window and the shape of the dose-response curve for a new drug on the basis of a limited number of doses. Adaptive designs have been proposed as a solution to improve both quality and efficiency of Phase II trials as they give the possibility to select the dose to be tested as the trial goes. In this article, we present a 'shapebased' two-stage adaptive trial design where the doses to be tested in the second stage are determined based on the correlation observed between efficacy of the doses tested in the first stage and a set of pre-specified candidate dose-response profiles. At the end of the trial, the data are analyzed using the generalized MCP-Mod approach in order to account for model uncertainty. A simulation study shows that this approach gives more precise estimates of a desired target dose (e.g. ED70) than a single-stage (fixed-dose) design and performs as well as a two-stage D-optimal design. We present the results of an adaptive model-based dose-ranging trial in multiple sclerosis that motivated this research and was conducted using the presented methodology.

Title #775: Structure-Activity Relationships of 1,2-Disubstituted Benzimidazoles: Selective Inhibition of Heme Oxygenase-2 Activity.
PMID: 26083133
Authors: Xianqi X. Kong, Dragic D. Vukomanovic, Kanji K. Nakatsu, Walter A WA. Szarek
Abstract: Devising ways to up- or down-regulate heme oxygenase activity is attracting much interest as a strategy for the treatment of a variety of disorders. With a view of obtaining compounds that exhibit high potency and selectivity as inhibitors of the heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) isozyme (constitutive) relative to the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) isozyme (inducible), several 1,2-disubstituted 1H-benzimidazoles were designed and synthesized. Specifically, analogues were synthesized in which the C2 substituent was the following: (1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl, (N-morpholinyl)methyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, or (norborn-2-yl)methyl. Compounds with the cyclic system in the C2 substituent being a carbocyclic ring, especially cyclohexyl or norborn-2-yl, and the N1 substituent being a ring-substituted benzyl group, especially 4-chlorobenzyl or 4-bromobenzyl, best exhibited the target criteria of high potency and selectivity toward inhibition of HO-2. The new candidates should be useful pharmacological tools and may have therapeutic applications.


Title #776: Managing Monoamniotic Twin Pregnancies.
PMID: 26083132
Authors: Annalisa A. Post, Kent K. Heyborne
Abstract: Monoamniotic twins comprise a rare but important subset of twins at risk of unique and serious complications, placing them at the highest risk of perinatal mortality of all twin gestations. In addition to risks faced by all twins (prematurity, selective growth restriction), all monochorionic twins (twin-twin transfusion syndrome), and all monozygotic twins (congenital anomalies), monoamniotic twins face the unique risk of cord entanglement. Accordingly, early diagnosis, screening for fetal anomalies, surveillance for twin-twin transfusion syndrome, decisions related to monitoring after viability, and timing and route of delivery are all critical. Herein, we present recommendations for optimal management.


Title #777: Fetal Surveillance and Timing of Delivery for Multiples.
PMID: 26083131
Authors: Elizabeth R ER. Unal
Abstract: This chapter describes the current evidence and recommendations for surveillance and delivery timing for multifetal gestations. Ultrasound surveillance should include early determination of chorionicity, anatomic survey for all twins with fetal echocardiography for monochorionic twins, and growth assessment every 4 weeks. Monochorionic twins should also undergo ultrasound surveillance for twin-twin transfusion syndrome every 2 weeks starting at 16 weeks. Weekly testing with nonstress tests or biophysical profiles is recommended at 32 weeks for monochorionic, diamniotic twins, and 34 weeks for dichorionic twins. If this surveillance is reassuring, optimal delivery timing is 36 weeks 0 days to 37 weeks 0 days for monochorionic, diamniotic twins, and 37 week 0 days to 38 weeks 0 days for dichorionic twins.


Title #778: The Normal Vulva, Vulvar Examination, and Evaluation Tools.
PMID: 26083130
Authors: Bina B. Cohen Sacher
Abstract: The appearance of the female external genitalia is key for understanding and diagnosing many diseases that women of all ages encounter. Alas, the normal appearance of the vulva is an elusive concept, scarcely represented in textbooks, and the growing number of vulvar cosmetic surgery calls for a review of the normal appearance of the vulva and its diversity. In this paper I will review vulvar embryology, anatomy, the current literature discussing vulvar appearance, and describe meticulous vulvar examination, including the diagnostic tools.


Title #779: Spontaneous Preterm Birth in Multiples.
PMID: 26083129
Authors: Joseph R JR. Biggio, Sarah S. Anderson
Abstract: The number of multiple gestations has increased over the last several decades and preterm birth is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality for these pregnancies. While screening and treatment strategies have achieved moderate success in singleton gestations, screening strategies are less effective in multiple gestations. In addition, to date no intervention aimed at preventing preterm birth has been conclusively shown to either prolong gestation or improve neonatal outcomes for multiple gestations. As in singleton gestations, cervical length is one of the strongest predictors of preterm birth. While not conclusive, emerging data suggest that vaginal progesterone or cervical pessary may be able to prevent preterm birth in twin gestations with a short cervix.


Title #780: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction.
PMID: 26083128
Authors: Sarah S. ObiÄan, Clifton C. Brock, Richard R. Berkowitz, Ronald J RJ. Wapner
Abstract: Multiple gestations of triplets or more have a significant increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality compared with twins. On average, triplet gestations deliver at approximately 33.5 weeks. Approximately 25% deliver at <32 weeks and 10% deliver <28 weeks. Maternal complications are also significantly increased. Multifetal pregnancy reduction involves the ultrasonically guided injection of KCl into the fetal thorax to induce asystole. It is performed to reduce the potential for early preterm delivery associated with higher-order multiple gestations. Multifetal pregnancy reduction to twins increases gestational age at delivery by 4 weeks and significantly improves maternal and fetal outcomes.


Title #781: Activin A accelerates the progression of fetal oocytes throughout meiosis and early oogenesis in the mouse.

Abstract: Activins can exert several roles in the ovary development. However, little is known about their involvement in early mammalian oogenesis. Here, we reported that Activin receptors (including ActRIA, ActRIB, ActRIIA and ActRIIB) are expressed throughout the development of the mouse ovaries from 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) to 21 days post parturition (dpp). Moreover, we found that in vitro, the addition of Activin A (ActA) to the culture medium of 12.5 dpc ovarian tissues accelerated the progression of oocytes throughout meiotic prophase I stages. This result was reproduced in vivo following administration of ActA to pregnant mice. The in vitro effect of ActA was associated with increased expression of premeiotic and meiotic genes (including Dazl, Spo11, Stra8, Scp3 and Rec8) in the ovarian tissues. Mechanistically, ActA-dependent SMAD3 signaling modulated the expression of members of the retinoic acid (RA) system including the RA degradation CYP26B1 enzyme and the retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Finally, ActA promoted the survival and growth of fetal and early postnatal oocytes and primordial follicle assembly both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the present study identify new roles of ActA in early oogenesis and suggested that ActA and RA might cooperate in promoting meiosis in female germ cells.


Title #782: A 1H NMR Study of Host/Guest Supramolecular Complexes of a Curcumin Analog with Î²Cyclodextrin and a Î²CD-conjugated Gemini Surfactant.
PMID: 26083126
Authors: Masoomeh M. Poorghorban, Abdalla H AH. Karoyo, Pawel P. Grochulski, Ronald E RE. Verrall, Lee D LD. Wilson, Ildiko I. Badea
Abstract: Host systems based on Î²cyclodextrin (Î²CD) were employed as pharmaceutical carriers to encapsulate a poorly soluble drug, curcumin analog (NC 2067), in order to increase its water solubility. Î²CD was chemically conjugated with an amphiphilic gemini surfactant with the ability to self-assemble and to form nanoscale supramolecular structures. The conjugated molecule, Î²CDgemini surfactant (Î²CDg), was shown to be a promising drug delivery agent. In this report, its physicochemical properties were assessed in aqueous solution using 1D and 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the apolar hydrocarbon domain of the gemini surfactant was self-included within the Î²CD internal cavity. The host/guest complexes composed of native Î²CD or Î²CDgemini surfactant with NC 2067 were examined using 1D/2D ROESY NMR methods. The stoichiometry of Î²CD/NC 2067 complex was estimated using Job's method via 1H NMR spectroscopy. The binding geometry of NC 2067 within Î²CD was proposed using molecular docking and further supported by 1D and 2D ROESY NMR results. Addition of NC 2067 to Î²CDgemini surfactant revealed minimal changes to the overall structure of the Î²CDgemini surfactant system, in agreement with the formation of a Î²CDg/NC 2067 ternary complex.


Title #783: Topologically induced swarming phase transition on a 2D percolated lattice.
PMID: 26083125
Authors: David A DA. Quint, Ajay A. Gopinathan
Abstract: The emergence of collective motion, or swarming, in groups of moving individuals who orient themselves using only information from their neighbors is a very general phenomenon that occurs at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Swarms that occur in natural environments typically have to contend with spatial disorder such as obstacles that can hinder an individual's motion or can disrupt communication with neighbors. We study swarming agents, possessing both aligning and mutually avoiding repulsive interactions, in a 2D percolated network representing a topologically disordered environment. We numerically find a phase transition from a collectively moving swarm to a disordered gas-like state above a critical value of the topological or environmental disorder. For agents that utilize only alignment interactions, we find that the swarming transition does not exist in the large system size limit, while the addition of a mutually repulsive interaction can restore the existence of the transition at a finite critical value of disorder. We find there is a finite range of topological disorder where swarming can occur and that this range can be maximized by an optimal amount of mutual repulsion.


Title #784: Biosynthesis of epimers C2 and C2a in the gentamicin C complex.
PMID: 26083124
Authors: Yawen Y. Gu, Xianpu X. Ni, Jun J. Ren, Huiyuan H. Gao, Da D. Wang, Huanzhang H. Xia
Abstract: Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The gentamicin C complex consists of C1, C1a, and epimers C2 and C2a. To date, a general pathway of gentamicin biosynthesis was proposed except the detailed understanding of epimerization. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of epimers C2 and C2a. JI-20B, an intermediate in the gentamicin biosynthetic pathway and its epimer JI-20Ba were generated by in-frame deletion within genP encoding a phosphotransferase, which catalyzed the first step of 3', 4'-bisdehydroxylation. GenB1 and GenB2 are aminotransferases with different substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. JI-20Ba with 6'-(S) chiral amine, a precursor of C2a, was synthesized from G418 by GenQ/GenB1 through oxidation/transamination at C-6'. GenQ/GenB2 catalyzed the synthesis of JI-20B with 6'-(R) chiral amine, a precursor of C2, from G418. GenB2 catalyzed the epimerization of JI-20Ba/JI-20B and C2a/C2.


Title #785: Hydrogen Production from a Methanol-Water Solution Catalyzed by an Anionic Iridium Complex Bearing a Functional Bipyridonate Ligand under Weakly Basic Conditions.
PMID: 26083123
Authors: Ken-Ichi KI. Fujita, Ryoko R. Kawahara, Takuya T. Aikawa, Ryohei R. Yamaguchi
Abstract: An efficient catalytic system for the production of hydrogen from a methanol-water solution has been developed using a new anionic iridium complex bearing a functional bipyridonate ligand as a catalyst. This system can be operated under mild conditions [weakly basic solution (0.046 molâL(-1) NaOH) below 100âÂ°C] without the use of an additional organic solvent. Long-term continuous hydrogen production from a methanol-water solution catalyzed by the anionic iridium complex was also achieved.

Title #787: Humanity, Teamwork, and Art in Post-Earthquake Nepal.
PMID: 26083121
Authors: Renee N RN. Salas
Abstract: April 25, 2015, began like any other day at the remote Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) clinic in Pheriche, Nepal, where I'd been working as a volunteer physician for the past 6 weeks. Days had passed quickly while our team cared for international trekkers and climbers, as well as local Nepalis, treating routine illnesses and addressing high-altitude emergencies. But on this day around noon, the ground began quaking beneath my feet as I sat in our living space. My bewilderment quickly dissipated as I darted outdoors to join the rest of the village in the open spaces. Time seemed to slow .Â .Â .

Abstract: Dhading, Nepal - By mid-May, this small town had come back to life after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck on April 25, 2015. Despite the occasional collapsed building, one saw open stores with fruit and food or electronics, open pharmacies, and tailors eager to create outfits from colorful bolts of fabric. Awakened by roosters at 4:30 a.m., I noticed people waiting patiently for the overstuffed buses that traversed the narrow, hairpin mountain roads to reach Kathmandu. I wandered down to a tiny cafÃ© that sold Nescafe and pastries, watching the drifting traffic of tractors, goats, and women with beautiful headdresses .Â .Â .


Title #789: Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Angelica gigas via Heme Oxygenase (HO)-1 Expression.
PMID: 26083119
Authors: Joon Hyeong JH. Cho, Jung Eun JE. Kwon, Youngmi Y. Cho, Inhye I. Kim, Se Chan SC. Kang
Abstract: Angelica gigas (AG) is effective against various medical conditions such as bacterial infection, inflammation, and cancer. It contains a number of coumarin compounds and the group of interest is the pyranocoumarin, which comprises decursin and decursinol angelate. This group has an effect on controlling inflammation, which is caused by excessive nitric oxide (NO) production. Heme oxygenases (HOs), particularly HO-1, play a role in regulating the production of NO. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of AG by measuring HO-1 expression. Treatments with CH2Cl2 layer and Angelica gigas extract (AGE) showed the highest NO inhibition effects. Decursin, decursinol angelate, and nodakenin were isolated from the CH2Cl2 layer of AGE. Decursin also demonstrated the highest anti-oxidative effect among the coumarins. Although decursin had the best NO inhibition and anti-oxidative effects, the effects of AGE treatment far surpassed that of decursin. This is owing to the combination effect of the coumarins present within AGE, which is a solvent extract of AG. The expression of HO-1 is an effective indicator of the anti-inflammatory effects of AG. Based on the results of the coumarin compounds, HO-1 expression was found to be dose dependent and specific to decursin.


Title #790: Î³-Oryzanol Enhances Adipocyte Differentiation and Glucose Uptake.
PMID: 26083118

Abstract: Recent studies show that brown rice improves glucose intolerance and potentially the risk of diabetes, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. One of the phytochemicals found in high concentration in brown rice is Î³-oryzanol (Orz), a group of ferulic acid esters of phytosterols and triterpene alcohols. Here, we found that Orz stimulated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and increased the protein expression of adipogenic marker genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³) and CCAAT/enhanced binding protein alpha (C/EBPÎ±). Moreover, Orz significantly increased the glucose uptake in insulin-resistant cells and translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from the cytosol to the cell surface. To investigate the mechanism by which Orz stimulated cell differentiation, we examined its effects on cellular signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth and proliferation. The Orz treatment increased mTORC1 kinase activity based on phosphorylation of 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The effect of Orz on adipocyte differentiation was dependent on mTORC1 activity because rapamycin blocks cell differentiation in Orz-treated cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Orz stimulates adipocyte differentiation, enhances glucose uptake, and may be associated with cellular signaling mediated by PPAR-Î³ and mTORC1.


Title #791: Protective Effect of the Total Saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx Fruit against Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Liver Fibrosis in Rats.
PMID: 26083117
Authors: Deshi D. Dong, Lianhong L. Yin, Yan Y. Qi, Lina L. Xu, Jinyong J. Peng
Abstract: In this study, the protective effect of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx (RLTS) against liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats was evaluated. The results showed that RLTS significantly rehabilitated the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, malondialdehyde, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydroxyproline, Î±-smooth muscle actin, collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin, which were confirmed using H&amp;E, Sirius Red and Masson histopathological assays. Further research indicated that RLTS markedly reduced cytochrome P450 2E1 activity, attenuated oxidative stress, and suppressed inflammation. In addition, RLTS facilitated matrix degradation through down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase2, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and metalloproteinases1, and exerted the anti-fibrotic effects through affecting transforming growth factor Î²/Smad, focal adhesion kinase/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/amino kinase terminal/70-kDa ribosomal S6 Kinase (FAK-PI3K-Akt-p70S6K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that RLTS can be applied as one effective candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis in the future.

Title #793: Associations between Vitamin D Status, Supplementation, Outdoor Work and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis Assessment.
PMID: 26083115
Authors: Liang L. Shen, Hong-Fang HF. Ji
Abstract: The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the associations between vitamin D and Parkinson's Disease (PD) risks, which include: (i) risk of PD in subjects with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels; (ii) association between vitamin D supplementation and risk of PD; and (iii) association between outdoor work and PD risk, through meta-analyzing available data. An electronic literature search supplemented by hand searching up to March 2015 identified seven eligible studies comprising 5690 PD patients and 21251 matched controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PD risk were assessed through pooling the collected data from eligible studies using Stata software. Pooled data showed that subjects with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels had increased PD risks compared with matched-controls according to the corresponding OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.63 to 2.65, and 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.51. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with significantly reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.90). Outdoor work was also related to reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.81). The findings may stimulate larger, well-designed studies to further verify the associations between vitamin D and PD risk.


Title #794: Does Motivation for Exercise Influence Post-Exercise Snacking Behavior?
PMID: 26083114
Authors: James A JA. Dimmock, Kym J KJ. Guelfi, Jessica S JS. West, Tasmiah T. Masih, Ben B. Jackson
Abstract: It is well established that regular exercise plays an important role in achieving a number of health and wellbeing outcomes. However, certain post-exercise behaviors, including the consumption of unhealthy high-calorie foods, can counteract some of the benefits of physical activity. There are at least three overlapping pathways through which exercise may increase the likelihood of consuming pleasurable but unhealthy foods: through impulsive cognitive processes, reflective cognitive processes, and/or physiological responses. It is argued in this paper that motivation toward exercise can influence each of these pathways. Drawing from literature from various domains, we postulate that controlled exercise motivation, as opposed to autonomous exercise motivation, is more likely to influence each of these pathways in a manner that leaves individuals susceptible to the post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods.


Title #795: Egg Yolk Protein Delays Recovery while Ovalbumin Is Useful in Recovery from Iron Deficiency Anemia.
PMID: 26083113
Authors: Yukiko Y. Kobayashi, Etsuko E. Wakasugi, Risa R. Yasui, Masashi M. Kuwahata, Yasuhiro Y. Kido
Abstract: Protein is a main nutrient involved in overall iron metabolism in vivo. In order to assess the prevention of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) by diet, it is necessary to confirm the influence of dietary protein, which coexists with iron, on iron bioavailability. We investigated the usefulness of the egg structural protein in recovery from IDA. Thirty-one female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control group (n = 6) fed a casein diet (4.0 mg Fe/100 g) for 42 days and an IDA model group (n = 25) created by feeding a low-iron casein diet (LI, 0.4 mg Fe/100 g) for 21 days and these IDA rats were fed normal iron diet with different proteins from eggs for another 21 days. The IDA rats were further divided into four subgroups depending on the proteins fed during the last 21 days, which were those with an egg white diet (LI-W, 4.0 mg Fe/100 g, n = 6), those with an ovalbumin diet (LI-A, 4.0 mg Fe/100 g, n = 7), those with an egg yolk-supplemented diet (LI-Y, 4.0 mg Fe/100 g, n = 6), and the rest with a casein diet (LI-C, 4.0 mg Fe/100 g, n = 6). In the LI-Y group, recovery of the hematocrit, hemoglobin, transferrin saturation level and the hepatic iron content were delayed compared to the other groups (p < 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively), resulting in no recovery from IDA at the end of the experimental period. There were no significant differences in blood parameters in the LI-W and LI-A groups compared to the control group. The hepatic iron content of the LI-W and LI-A groups was higher than that of the LI-C group (p < 0.05). We found that egg white protein was useful for recovery from IDA and one of the efficacious components was ovalbumin, while egg yolk protein delayed recovery of IDA. This study demonstrates, therefore, that bioavailability of dietary iron varies depending on the source of dietary protein.


Title #796: Dietary Patterns Modulate the Risk of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Chinese Adults.
PMID: 26083112

Abstract: Although previous studies reported the associations between the intakes of individual foods or nutrients and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the relationship between dietary patterns and NAFLD in the Chinese population has been rarely studied to date. This study aimed to investigate the associations between dietary patterns and the risk of NAFLD in a middle-aged Chinese population. The Study subjects were 999 Chinese adults aged 45-60 years in the Anhui province who participated in the Hefei Nutrition and Health Study. Dietary intake was collected by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. NAFLD was defined as the presence of moderate-severe hepatic steatosis (by B-ultrasonic examination); the absence of excessive alcohol use (>20 g day-1 in men and 10 g day-1 in women); no use of steatogenic medications within the past six months; no exposure to hepatotoxins; and no history of bariatric surgery. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to examine the association between dietary patterns and NAFLD with adjustment of potential confounding variables. Out of 999 participants, 345 (34.5%) were classified as having NAFLD. Four major dietary patterns were identified: "Traditional Chinese", "Animal food", "Grains-vegetables" and "High-salt" dietary patterns. After adjusting for potential confounders, subjects in the highest quartile of the "Animal food" pattern scores had greater prevalence ratio for NAFLD (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.354; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.063-1.724; p < 0.05) than did those in the lowest quartile. After adjustment for body mass index (BMI), compared with the lowest quartile of the "Grains-vegetables" pattern, the highest quartile had a lower prevalence ratio for NAFLD (PR = 0.777; 95% CI: 0.618-0.977, p < 0.05). However, the "traditional Chinese" and "high-salt" dietary patterns showed no association with the risk of NAFLD. Our findings indicated that the "Animal food" dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD.


Title #797: Association of Canonical Wnt/Î²-Catenin Pathway and Type 2 Diabetes: Genetic Epidemiological Study in Han Chinese.
PMID: 26083111
Authors: Jinjin J. Wang, Jingzhi J. Zhao, Jianfeng J. Zhang, Xinping X. Luo, Kaiping K. Gao, Ming M. Zhang, Linlin L. Li, Chongjian C. Wang, Dongsheng D. Hu
Abstract: We aimed to investigate the associations of polymorphisms in Canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway (WNT) signaling genes (including low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5 [LRP5] and transcription factor 7-like 2 [TCF7L2] gene) and the downstream gene glucagon (GCG) and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a Han Chinese population. We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for LRP5, TCF7L2 and GCG gene were genotyped in 1842 patients with T2DM and 7777 normal glucose-tolerant healthy subjects. We used multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and multiplicative logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, anthropometric measurements and lipid levels to investigate the gene-gene interactions for the risk of T2DM. Among the five SNPs in LRP5, the recessive model of rs7102273 and the haplotype GCTCC were associated with T2DM risk; the haplotype GCTTC was associated with decreased risk. For TCF7L2, the rs11196218 genotype GA and the haplotype CCG, TTG, TTA were associated with T2DM risk; whereas, the haplotype CTG and TCG were associated with decreased risk. Both MDR and multiplicative logistic regression revealed potential gene-gene interactions among LRP5, TCF7L2, and GCG associated with T2DM. The WNT signaling pathway may play a significant role in risk of T2DM in Han Chinese people.


Title #798: Aliphatic acid-conjugated antimicrobial peptides - potential agents with anti-tumor, multidrug resistance-reversing activity and enhanced stability.
PMID: 26083110
Authors: Xin X. Deng, Qianqian Q. Qiu, Ke K. Ma, Xuekun X. Wang, Wenlong W. Huang, Hai H. Qian
Abstract: Compared with traditional therapeutics, antimicrobial peptides as novel anti-tumor agents have prominent advantages of higher specificity and circumvention of multi-drug resistance. In a previous study, we found that B1, an antimicrobial peptide derived from Cathelicidin-BF15, presented specific anti-tumor activity against several tumor cells. Since aliphatic chain-conjugated peptides have shown ameliorative activity and stability, we conjugated aliphatic acids with different lengths to the amino terminal of B1. All the conjugated peptides exhibited improved anti-tumor activity over B1. Further investigations revealed that the peptides were capable of disrupting the cell membrane, stimulating cytochrome c release into the cytosol, which results in apoptosis. The peptides also acted against multidrug resistant cells and had multidrug resistance-reversing effects. Additionally, conjugation of aliphatic acid enhanced the peptide stability in plasma. In summary, aliphatic acid-modified peptides might be promising anti-tumor agents in the future.


Title #799: Seroprevalence of hepatitis A in Iranian adolescents: is it time to introduce a vaccine?

Abstract: Universal vaccination of children for hepatitis A virus (HAV) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to prevent this infection in regions with high incidence of symptomatic disease. Age-specific seroprevalence surveys are practical and reliable methods to estimate the rate of susceptibility in populations, and to help the implementation of vaccination policies. We surveyed the age-specific HAV seroprevalence in a nationally representative sample of Iranian adolescent students aged 10-18 years. Serum samples (nÂ =Â 2494) were tested by enzyme immunoassay for total anti-HAV antibody. The overall rate of HAV seropositivity was 64% [95% confidence interval (CI), 62-66), which increased sharply from 14Â·8% (95% CI 7-23) at age 10 years to 72Â·9% (95% CI 68-78) at age 13 years, without a significant increase up to age 18 years. No significant difference in HAV seroprevalence was observed between males and females (63% vs. 65Â·1%), or urban and rural areas (63Â·4% vs. 65Â·2%); the seropositivity rate was similar in four different socioeconomic regions of Iran. We conclude that the seroconversion rate of HAV is high in Iranian adolescents and therefore mass vaccination of children may be necessary and should be considered by national health authorities.

PMID: 26083104
Authors: Andrew A. Pearson, Anthony P AP. O'Mullane
Abstract: Here we demonstrate that commercial carbon supported Pt nanoparticles react with [AuCl4](-) ions at room temperature to produce a highly active Au/Pt/C material with an ultralow coverage of elemental Au on the Pt nanoparticles that exhibits significantly enhanced activity for ethanol oxidation when compared to Pt/C.


Title #801: Fucoidan Extracts Ameliorate Acute Colitis.
PMID: 26083103

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and impact significantly on quality of life. Overall, current treatments do not sustain a long-term clinical remission and are associated with adverse effects, which highlight the need for new treatment options. Fucoidans are complex sulphated, fucose-rich polysaccharides, found in edible brown algae and are described as having multiple bioactivities including potent anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of two different fucoidan preparations, fucoidan-polyphenol complex (Maritech Synergy) and depyrogenated fucoidan (DPF) was evaluated in the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. Mice were treated once daily over 7 days with fucoidans via oral (Synergy or DPF) or intraperitoneal administration (DPF). Signs and severity of colitis were monitored daily before colons and spleens were collected for macroscopic evaluation, cytokine measurements and histology. Orally administered Synergy and DPF, but not intraperitoneal DPF treatment, significantly ameliorated symptoms of colitis based on retention of body weight, as well as reduced diarrhoea and faecal blood loss, compared to the untreated colitis group. Colon and spleen weight in mice treated with oral fucoidan was also significantly lower, indicating reduced inflammation and oedema. Histological examination of untreated colitis mice confirmed a massive loss of crypt architecture and goblet cells, infiltration of immune cells and oedema, while all aspects of this pathology were alleviated by oral fucoidan. Importantly, in this model, the macroscopic changes induced by oral fucoidan correlated significantly with substantially decreased production of at least 15 pro-inflammatory cytokines by the colon tissue. Overall, oral fucoidan preparations significantly reduce the inflammatory pathology associated with DSS-induced colitis and could therefore represent a novel nutraceutical option for the management of IBD.

Abstract: 3-iodo-1H-pyrrolo[3',2':4,5]imidazo-[1,2-a]pyridines and [1,2-b]pyridazines were prepared following Groebke-Blackburn-BienaymÃ© MCR combined with I2-promoted electrophilic cyclization. The flexibility of the method enables the introduction of diversity in the 2, 5, 6, and 7 positions on the resulting scaffold using commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, subsequent palladium-catalyzed reactions were successfully achieved using our iodinated derivatives.


Title #803: Holocene Demographic Changes and the Emergence of Complex Societies in Prehistoric Australia.
PMID: 26083101
Authors: Alan N AN. Williams, Sean S. Ulm, Chris S M CS. Turney, David D. Rohde, Gentry G. White
Abstract: A continental-scale model of Holocene Australian hunter-gatherer demography and mobility is generated using radiocarbon data and geospatial techniques. Results show a delayed expansion and settlement of much of Australia following the termination of the late Pleistocene until after 9,000 years ago (or 9ka). The onset of the Holocene climatic optimum (9-6ka) coincides with rapid expansion, growth and establishment of regional populations across ~75% of Australia, including much of the arid zone. This diffusion from isolated Pleistocene refugia provides a mechanism for the synchronous spread of pan-continental archaeological and linguistic attributes at this time (e.g. Pama-Nyungan language, Panaramitee art style, backed artefacts). We argue longer patch residence times were possible at the end of the optimum, resulting in a shift to more sedentary lifestyles and establishment of low-level food production in some parts of the continent. The onset of El NiÃ±o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO; 4.5-2ka) restricted low-level food production, and resulted in population fragmentation, abandonment of marginal areas, and reduction in ranging territory of ~26%. Importantly, climate amelioration brought about by more pervasive La NiÃ±a conditions (post-2ka), resulted in an intensification of the mobility strategies and technological innovations that were developed in the early- to mid-Holocene. These changes resulted in population expansion and utilization of the entire continent. We propose that it was under these demographically packed conditions that the complex social and religious societies observed at colonial contact were formed.


Title #804: Flavonol glycosides and other phenolic compounds from Viola tianshanica and their anti-complement activities.
PMID: 26083100
Authors: Yan Y. Qin, Quan Q. Wen, Jie J. Cao, Chengle C. Yin, Daofeng D. Chen, Zhihong Z. Cheng
Abstract: Viola tianshanica Maxim. (Violaceae) is a perennial herb distributed in Central Asia, especially in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China. Preliminary study showed that the ethanol extract of the herb exhibited the anti-complement activity against the classical pathway, but the active components responsible for this capacity remain unknown and are yet to be studied.


Title #805: 3D Hollow Framework Silver Nanowire Electrodes for High-Performance Bottom-Contact Organic Transistors.
PMID: 26083099
Authors: Jiye J. Kim, So Hee SH. Lee, Haekyoung H. Kim, Se Hyun SH. Kim, Chan Eon CE. Park
Abstract: We successfully fabricate high performance bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using AgNW networks electrodes by spray deposition. The synthesized AgNWs have the dimension of 40-80 nm in diameter and 30-80 Âµm in length and were randomly distributed and interconnected to form a 3D hollow framework. The AgNWs film, deposited by spray coating, yielded an average optical transmittance of up to 88 % and a sheet resistance as low as 10 ohm/sq. For using AgNWs as source/drain electrodes of OFETs with bottom-contact configuration, the large contact resistance at AgNWs/organic channel remains critical issue for charge injection. To enhance charge injection, we fabricate semiconductor crystals on the AgNW using adsorbed residual poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) layer. The resulting bottom-contact OFETs exhibit high mobility up to 1.02 cm2/Vs, and are similar to that of the top-contact Au electrodes OFETs with low contact resistance. A morphological study shows that the pentacene crystals coalesced to form continuous morphology on the nanowires, and were highly interconnected with those on the channel. These features contribute to efficient charge injection and encourage the improvement of the bottom-contact device performance. Furthermore, large contact area of individual AgNWs spreading out to the channel at the edge of the electrode also improves device performance.


Title #806: Sizing Individual Au Nanoparticles in Solution with Sub-Nanometer Resolution.
PMID: 26083098
Authors: Sean R SR. German, Timothy S TS. Hurd, Henry S HS. White, Tony L TL. Mega
Abstract: Resistive-pulse sensing has generated considerable interest as a technique for characterizing nanoparticle suspensions. The size, charge, and shape of individual particles can be estimated from features of the resistive pulse, but the technique suffers from an inherent variability due to the stochastic nature of particles translocating through a small orifice or channel. Here we report a method, and associated automated instrumentation, that allows repeated pressure-driven translocation of individual particles back and forth across the orifice of a conical nanopore, greatly reducing uncertainty in particle size that results from streamline path distributions, particle diffusion, particle asphericity, and electronic noise. We demonstrate ~0.3 nm resolution in measuring the size of nominally 30- and 60-nm radius Au nanoparticles of spherical geometry; Au nanoparticles in solution that differ by ~1 nm in radius are readily distinguished. The repetitive translocation method also allows differentiating particles based on surface charge density, and provides insights into factors that determine the distribution of measured particle sizes.


Title #807: Purification, Characterization, and Analysis of the Allergenic Properties of Myosin Light Chain in Procambarus clarkii.

Abstract: Myosin light chain (MLC) plays a vital role in cell and muscle functions and has been identified as an allergen in shrimp. In this study, MLC with the molecular mass of 18 kDa was purified from crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) muscle. Its physicochemical characterization showed that the purified MLC is a glycoprotein with 4.3% carbohydrate, highly stable to heat, acid-alkali and digestion, and weakly retains IgE-binding activity when its secondary structure was altered. Serological assays suggested that conformational epitopes predominate over linear epitopes in the purified MLC. Two isoforms of the MLC gene (MLC1 and MLC2) were cloned, and the purified MLC was identified as MLC1. Analysis of the secondary and tertiary structures of the MLCs indicated that MLC1 has four conformational epitopes and three linear epitopes, whereas MLC2 had a major conformational epitope and three linear epitopes. These results are significant for understanding hypersensitization of humans to crayfish.


Title #808: "Cap-and-Catch" Purification for Enhancing the Quality of Libraries of DNA Conjugates.

Abstract: The potential of DNA-encoded combinatorial libraries (DECLs) as tools for hit discovery crucially relies on the availability of methods for their synthesis at acceptable purity and quality. Incomplete reactions in the presence of DNA can noticeably affect the purity of DECLs and methods to selectively remove unreacted oligonucleotide-based starting products would likely enhance the quality of DECL screening results. We describe an approach to selectively remove unreacted oligonucleotide starting products from reaction mixtures and demonstrate its applicability in the context of acylation of amino-modified DNA. Following an amide bond forming reaction, we treat unreacted amino-modified DNAs with biotinylating reagents and isolate the corresponding biotinylated oligonucleotides from the reaction mixture by affinity capture on streptavidin-coated sepharose. This approach, which yields the desired DNA-conjugate at enhanced purity, can be applied both to reactions performed in solution and to procedures in which DNA is immobilized on an anion exchange solid support.


Title #809: Chemical fucosylation of a polysaccharide: a semi-synthetic access to fucosylated chondroitin sulfate.

Abstract: Chemical O-glycosylation of polysaccharides is an almost unexplored reaction. This is mainly due to the difficulties in derivatizing such complex biomacromolecules in a quantitative manner and with a fine control of the obtained structural parameters. In this work, chondroitin raw material from a microbial source was chemo- and regioselectively protected to give two polysaccharide intermediates, that acted in turn as glycosyl acceptors in fucosylation reactions. Further manipulations on the fucosylated polysaccharides, including multiple de-O-benzylation and sulfation, furnished for the first time non-animal sourced fucosylated chondroitin sulfates (fCSs) - polysaccharides obtained so far exclusively from sea cucumbers (Echinoidea, Holothuroidea). and showing several very interesting biological activities. A semi-synthetic fCS was characterized from a structural point of view by means of 2D-NMR techniques, and preliminarily assayed in an anticoagulant test.


Title #810: Evaluation of fine needle aspiration biopsy in oral cavity and head and neck region with different stains techniques.
PMID: 26083094

Abstract: The present study aimed to evaluate the Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy in different staining techniques in nodular lesions of the oral cavity and head and neck region, as their sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, staining with Panoptic, Papanicolaou and Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stains. 46 patients who sought the Clinic of the Discipline of Clinical Stomatology at FOUSP were selected consecutively, with nodular lesions in the oral cavity and head and neck region. The material obtained by FNAB was sent on 6 different slides, stained by the method of Panoptic, Papanicolaou and H&E, to the same pathologist only with the clinical diagnosis. After the final report of FNAB, the biopsy report was issued, serving as gold standard. After the calculations, the results of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for Panoptic staining were 28.6%, 76% and 15.4%, respectively. The result of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for Papanicolaou staining were 71.4%, 76.7% and 23.3%, respectively. The result of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for H&E staining were 82.1%, 23.3%, 28.6%, respectively. We can conclude, according to the methodology of this study that, H&E and Papanicolaou stains showed the same sensitivity of diagnosing malignant neoplasms. H&E stain showed a better specificity for diagnosing benign neoplasms, compared with Papanicolaou and Panoptic stains. H&E stain showed better accuracy, to give definitive diagnosis, followed by Papanicolaou and Panoptic stains.


Title #811: Influence of flexion angle of files on the decentralization of oval canals during instrumentation.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the flexion angle of files on the decentralization of root canals during instrumentation. Fifteen lower incisors were instrumented with Protaper Universal files and radiographed in two directions (mesiodistal and buccolingual) before and after instrumentation with a #15 K-file in position for evaluating the flexion angle of files. The specimens were also scanned before and after instrumentation using micro-computed tomography to obtain the canal area and the distance from the center position of the file to the canal walls. Sections located 1.0 mm (end of the canal), 3.0 mm (apical third), 9.0 mm (middle third), and 15.0 mm (cervical third) from the apex were verified. After instrumentation, the flexion angles of files decreased by an average of 0.76Âº in the buccolingual direction and 1.92Âº in the mesiodistal direction (p < 0.001); the canal area increased by an average of 0.58, 0.37, 0.23 and 0.13 mm2 from the cervical to the end of the root canal (p < 0.001). Non-instrumented areas were observed on the buccal and lingual walls, and effective action of files was determined on the mesial and distal walls. The sections from the end of the canal showed canal deviation toward the lingual wall, whereas the other sections showed deviation toward the buccal wall. The flexion angles of files influence the final shape of the root canal, resulting in file decentralization along the pathway of the canal.


Title #812: Detection and sampling methods for isolation of Candida spp. from oral cavities in diabetics and non-diabetics.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to detect Candida spp. on the tongue and in the subgingival sites in healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), and to compare the accuracy of sampling methods. This study included 131 patients divided into four groups: healthy control (group A), nondiabetics + CP (Group B), diabetics with good metabolic control + CP (group C) and diabetics with poor glycoregulation + CP (Group D). Cotton swab samples from tongue and subgingival samples were obtained from each patient with help of sterile paper points and a sterile curette. Swab cultures were made on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The number of CFUs was counted. The sampling methods for subgingival plaque were compared by Receiving Operator Curve (ROC). The presence of Candida spp. on the tongue was statistically significant among groups (group D vs. others three groups: Ï2: p < 0.005 for each group). Positive findings of subgingival Candida spp. did not differ among the groups. There were no significant differences in the quantification of Candida spp., neither on the tongue, nor in the subgingival samples. 17.2% of diabetic patients revealed the presence of Candida spp. in the subgingival samples, with negative finding on tongue. There was a significant difference in the sampling methods for subgingival plaque (p = 0.000). Candida spp. is more prevalent on the tongue of diabetics. The sampling of subgingival plaque by a sterile curette is more accurate than with paper points. Subgingival plaque may represent a reservoir of commensals. It is necessary to standardize the sampling of subgingival plaque.


Title #813: Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH): conservative treatment management to restore affected teeth.
PMID: 26083091
Authors: Camila Maria Bullio CM. Fragelli, Juliana Feltrin de JF. Souza, Fabiano F. Jeremias, Rita de CÃ¡ssia Loiola RC. Cordeiro, Lourdes L. Santos-Pinto
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 12-month clinical performance of glass ionomer restorations in teeth with MIH. First permanent molars affected by MIH (48) were restored with glass ionomer cement (GIC) and evaluated at baseline, at 6 and at 12 months, by assessing tooth enamel breakdown, GIC breakdown and caries lesion associations. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test and actuarial survival analysis. The likelihood of a restored tooth remaining unchanged at the end of 12 months was 78%. No statistically significant difference was observed in the association between increased MIH severity and caries at baseline (p > 0.05) for a 6-month period, or between increased MIH severity and previous unsatisfactory treatment at baseline (p > 0.05) for both a 6- and 12-month period. A statistically significant difference was observed in the association between increased MIH severity and extension of the restoration, involving 2 or more surfaces (p < 0.05) at both periods, and between increased MIH severity and caries at baseline (p < 0.05) at a 12-month period. Because the likelihood of maintaining the tooth structures with GIC restorations is high, invasive treatment should be postponed until the child is sufficiently mature to cooperate with the treatment, mainly of teeth affected on just one face.


Title #814: A 10-year analysis of the oral squamous cell carcinoma profile in patients from public health centers in Uruguay.
PMID: 26083090

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics and predictive factors of poor prognosis in patients with primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in Uruguay. Medical records of patients with the diagnosis of primary OSCC treated between 2000 and 2010 in Uruguayan public hospitals were selected. Data on demographic characteristics, risk factors, clinical features, treatment, and outcome were collected. Associations of independent variables with outcomes were assessed using Pearson chi-squared and Fisher's tests. Of 200 patients with OSCC, 79.4% were men (3.8:1 male:female ratio), with a mean age of 60.75 Â± 11.26 years. Tobacco and alcohol consumption were reported by 85.3% and 63.5% of patients, respectively. The most commonly affected location was the tongue (42.5%), with lesions exhibiting ulcerous aspects in 87.9% of cases and pain at the time of diagnosis in 70.4% of cases. One hundred sixty-one (82.1%) patients had advanced-stage (III/IV) OSCC. Surgery was the most common treatment option, and the overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%. Univariate analysis showed that the predictors of poor prognosis were clinical aspect, size, regional metastasis, clinical stage, and treatment. In Uruguay, OSCC is diagnosed late, which is associated with a low survival rate. Educational and preventive measures and investment to improve early diagnosis should be undertaken.


Title #815: A systematic review of factors associated with the retention of glass fiber posts.
PMID: 26083089
Authors: Jovito Adiel JA. Skupien, Rafael R. Sarkis-Onofre, Maximiliano SÃ©rgio MS. Cenci, Rafael Ratto de RR. Moraes, Tatiana T. Pereira-Cenci
Abstract: This study aimed to identify factors that can affect the retention of glass fiber posts to intra-radicular dentin based on in vitro studies that compared the bond strength (BS) of GFPs cemented with resin cements. Searches were carried out in PubMed and Scopus until December 2013. Bond strength values and variables as type of tooth, presence of endodontic treatment, pretreatment of the post, type of bonding agent (if present), type of cement and mode of cement application were extracted from the 34 included studies. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the influence of these parameters on BS. The presence of endodontic treatment decreased the BS values in 22.7% considering the pooled data (p = 0.013). For regular cement, cleaning the post increased BS when compared to silane application without cleaning (p = 0.032), considering cleaning as ethanol, air abrasion, or phosphoric acid application. Applying the cement around the post and into root canal decreased the resistance compared to only around the post (p = 0.02) or only into root canal (p = 0.041), on the other hand, no difference was found for self-adhesive resin cement for the same comparisons (p = 0.858 and p = 0.067). Endodontic treatment, method of cement application, and post pretreatment are factors that might significantly affect the retention of glass-fiber posts into root canals mainly when cemented with regular resin cement. Self-adhesive resin cements were found to be less technique-sensitive to luting procedures as compared with regular resin cements.


Title #816: Effects of the association of antifungal drugs on the antimicrobial action of endodontic sealers.
PMID: 26083088

Abstract: This in vitro study aimed to determine the susceptibility of oral specimens and ATCC lineages of Candida albicans for five endodontic sealers, which were pure and associated with two antifungal drugs, and to analyze their effect on the physical properties. For this purpose, 30 lineages of C. albicans, collected from the oral cavity of patients assisted at the endodontics clinic of the Universidade Sagrado CoraÃ§Ã£o, were analyzed. Yeasts susceptibility to the sealers was tested by diffusion on agar plates. Physical properties were evaluated according to the ADA specification no. 57. The pure versions of the Sealer 26, AH Plus, Endofill, Fillapex, and Sealapex demonstrated antifungal activity, with Endofill presenting the greatest inhibition zones. All cements, except for Endofill, had their antifungal actions enhanced by addition of ketoconazole and fluconazole (p < 0.05), and the AH Plus presented the best antifungal activity. The addition of antifungal drugs did not interfere with the setting time and flowability of the sealers. It was concluded that the addition of antifungals to endodontic sealers enhanced the antimicrobial action of most cements tested without altering their physical properties.


Title #817: The effect of CPP-ACP and Nd:YAG laser on the bond strength of softened dentin.
PMID: 26083086

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of CPP-ACP treatment and Nd:YAG laser on microtensile bond strength (ÂµTBS) of softened dentin. Sixty samples were obtained from thirty sound third molars. All samples were submitted to dentin softening procedure, by the immersion of the specimens in 30 mL of Sprite Zero for 30min. Afterwards, the samples were randomly divided according to the CPP-ACP treatment: CG-Control group; MP-treated with CPP-ACP paste (MI Paste); MPP-treated with CPP-ACP+900 ppm NaF paste (MI Paste Plus). Each group was further divided according to bonding procedure: NL-No laser; L-Laser irradiation after adhesive application and before polymerization. The laser parameters used were 1.4 W, 10 Hz, 140 mJ/pulse, with an optic fiber of 320 Âµm, generating energy of 174 J/cm2 per pulse. All samples were restored with Clearfil SE Bond/Filtek Z350 XT. After 24 h, the restored samples were cut into beams (Â± 1 mm2 adhesive interface area) and subjected to a ÂµTBS test. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA test and Holm-Sidak post-hoc method (Î± = 0.05). The treatment with CPP-ACP pastes did not significantly affect softened dentin ÂµTBS (p = 0.070). Statistic revealed significant reduction on ÂµTBS values for CG/L, leading to the rejection of the second null hypothesis (p < 0.001). Both CPP-ACP based pastes did not affect ÂµTBS of softened dentin for the adhesive system utilized. The Nd:YAG laser irradiation after application of adhesive system did affect ÂµTBS values of softened dentin samples untreated with CPP-ACP based pastes.


Title #818: Production of novel NaN3-resistant creatine amidinohydrolase in recombinant Escherichia coli.

Authors: Zhen Z. Kang, Jun J. Dai, Song S. Liu, Jianghua J. Li, Jian J. Chen, Guocheng G. Du
Abstract: Creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase), an important medical enzyme, has been used for clinical diagnosis of renal function because of its high substrate specificity. Recently, we successfully cloned a NaN3-resistant creatinase encoding gene from Arthrobacter nicotianae. By optimizing the cultivation process, we realized its high-level expression in Escherichia coli. In this addendum, production of this NaN3-resistant creatinase in E. coli and future research were further discussed.


Title #819: Molecular Phylogeny of the Widely Distributed Marine Protists, Phaeodaria (Rhizaria, Cercozoa).
PMID: 26083083

Abstract: Phaeodarians are a group of widely distributed marine cercozoans. These plankton organisms can exhibit a large biomass in the environment and are supposed to play an important role in marine ecosystems and in material cycles in the ocean. Accurate knowledge of phaeodarian classification is thus necessary to better understand marine biology, however, phylogenetic information on Phaeodaria is limited. The present study analyzed 18S rDNA sequences encompassing all existing phaeodarian orders, to clarify their phylogenetic relationships and improve their taxonomic classification. The monophyly of Phaeodaria was confirmed and strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis with a larger data set than in previous studies. The phaeodarian clade contained 11 subclades which generally did not correspond to the families and orders of the current classification system. Two families (Challengeriidae and Aulosphaeridae) and two orders (Phaeogromida and Phaeocalpida) are possibly polyphyletic or paraphyletic, and consequently the classification needs to be revised at both the family and order levels by integrative taxonomy approaches. Two morphological criteria, 1) the scleracoma type and 2) its surface structure, could be useful markers at the family level.


Title #820: Predicting location of recurrence using FDG, FLT, and Cu-ATSM PET in canine sinonasal tumors treated with radiotherapy.
PMID: 26083082

Abstract: Dose painting relies on the ability of functional imaging to identify resistant tumor subvolumes to be targeted for additional boosting. This work assessed the ability of FDG, FLT, and Cu-ATSM PET imaging to predict the locations of residual FDG PET in canine tumors following radiotherapy. Nineteen canines with spontaneous sinonasal tumors underwent PET/CT imaging with radiotracers FDG, FLT, and Cu-ATSM prior to hypofractionated radiotherapy. Therapy consisted of 10 fractions of 4.2âGy to the sinonasal cavity with or without an integrated boost of 0.8âGy to the GTV. Patients had an additional FLT PET/CT scan after fraction 2, a Cu-ATSM PET/CT scan after fraction 3, and follow-up FDG PET/CT scans after radiotherapy. Following image registration, simple and multiple linear and logistic voxel regressions were performed to assess how well pre- and mid-treatment PET imaging predicted post-treatment FDG uptake. R(2) and pseudo R(2) were used to assess the goodness of fits. For simple linear regression models, regression coefficients for all pre- and mid-treatment PET images were significantly positive across the population (Pâ<â0.05). However, there was large variability among patients in goodness of fits: R(2) ranged from 0.00 to 0.85, with a median of 0.12. Results for logistic regression models were similar. Multiple linear regression models resulted in better fits (median R(2) = 0.31), but there was still large variability between patients in R(2). The R(2) from regression models for different predictor variables were highly correlated across patients (Râââ0.8), indicating tumors that were poorly predicted with one tracer were also poorly predicted by other tracers. In conclusion, the high inter-patient variability in goodness of fits indicates that PET was able to predict locations of residual tumor in some patients, but not others. This suggests not all patients would be good candidates for dose painting based on a single biological target.


Title #821: Enhanced light collection in fluorescence microscopy using self-assembled micro-reflectors.
PMID: 26083081
Authors: ZoltÃ¡n Z. GÃ¶rÃ¶cs, Euan E. McLeod, Aydogan A. Ozcan
Abstract: In fluorescence microscopy, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the optical system is directly linked to the numerical aperture (NA) of the microscope objective, which creates detection challenges for low-NA, wide-field and high-throughput imaging systems. Here we demonstrate a method to increase the light collection efficiency from micron-scale fluorescent objects using self-assembled vapor-condensed polyethylene glycol droplets, which act as micro-reflectors for fluorescent light. Around each fluorescent particle, a liquid meniscus is formed that increases the excitation efficiency and redirects part of the laterally-emitted fluorescent light towards the detector due to internal reflections at the liquid-air interface of the meniscus. The three-dimensional shape of this micro-reflector can be tuned as a function of time, vapor temperature, and substrate contact angle, providing us optimized SNR performance for fluorescent detection. Based on these self-assembled micro-reflectors, we experimentally demonstrate ~2.5-3 fold enhancement of the fluorescent signal from 2-10âÎ¼m sized particles. A theoretical explanation of the formation rate and shapes of these micro-reflectors is presented, along with a ray tracing model of their optical performance. This method can be used as a sample preparation technique for consumer electronics-based microscopy and sensing tools, thus increasing the sensitivity of low-NA systems that image fluorescent micro-objects.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between adult height and tooth loss and to examine the roles of covariates in explaining the association in different birth cohorts in Korea.


Title #825: A bispecific antibody targeting CD47 and CD20 selectively binds and eliminates dual antigen expressing lymphoma cells.

Abstract: Agents that block the anti-phagocytic signal CD47 can synergize with pro-phagocytic anti-tumor antigen antibodies to potently eliminate tumors. While CD47 is overexpressed on cancer cells, its expression in many normal tissues may create an 'antigen sink' that could minimize the therapeutic efficacy of CD47 blocking agents. Here, we report development of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that co-target CD47 and CD20, a therapeutic target for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), that have reduced affinity for CD47 relative to the parental antibody, but retain strong binding to CD20. These characteristics facilitate selective binding of BsAbs to tumor cells, leading to phagocytosis. Treatment of human NHL-engrafted mice with BsAbs reduced lymphoma burden and extended survival while recapitulating the synergistic efficacy of anti-CD47 and anti-CD20 combination therapy. These findings serve as proof of principle for BsAb targeting of CD47 with tumor-associated antigens as a viable strategy to induce selective phagocytosis of tumor cells and recapitulate the synergy of combination antibody therapy. This approach may be broadly applied to cancer to add a CD47 blocking component to existing antibody therapies.


Title #826: Effects of Particle Filters and Selective Catalytic Reduction on Heavy-Duty Diesel Drayage Truck Emissions at the Port of Oakland.
PMID: 26083075
Authors: Chelsea Victoria CV. Preble, Timothy R TR. Dallmann, Nathan M NM. Kreisberg, Susanne V SV. Hering, Robert A RA. Harley, Thomas W TW. Kirchstetter
Abstract: Effects of fleet modernization and use of diesel particle filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) on heavy-duty diesel truck emissions were studied at the Port of Oakland in California. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), black carbon (BC), particle number (PN), and size distributions were measured in the exhaust plumes of ~1,400 drayage trucks. Average NOx, BC, and PN emission factors for newer engines (2010-2013 model years) equipped with both DPFs and SCR were 69 Â± 15%, 92 Â± 32%, and 66 Â± 35% lower, respectively, than 2004-2006 engines without these technologies. Intentional oxidation of NO to NO2 for DPF regeneration increased tailpipe NO2 emissions, especially from older (1994-2006) engines with retrofit DPFs. Increased deployment of advanced controls has further skewed emission factor distributions; a small number of trucks emit a disproportionately large fraction of total BC and NOx. The fraction of DPF-equipped drayage trucks increased from 2 to 99% and the median engine age decreased from 11 to 6 years between 2009 and 2013. Over this period, fleet-average BC and NOx emission factors decreased by 76 Â± 22% and 53 Â± 8%, respectively. Emission changes occurred rapidly compared to what would have been observed due to natural (i.e., unforced) turnover of the Port truck fleet. These results provide a preview of more widespread emission changes expected statewide and nationally in the coming years.


Title #827: Impressive Transmission Mode Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Parameters of Graphene like Nanocarbon/Polyurethane Nanocomposites for Short Range Tracking Countermeasures.
PMID: 26083074
Authors: Arvind A. Kumar, Prashant S PS. Alegaonkar
Abstract: Shielding microwave signature (8.2 to 12.4 GHz, X-band) of a locked in target is tactically important electronic countermeasures. Herein, we report on mitigation in X-band transmission mode shielding parameters for polyurethane (PU), after incorporating graphene-like nanocarbon (GNCs). Initially, PU and variable wt% (1-25) GNCs/PU paste samples were subjected to Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. These samples were molded into toroidal shaped specimen by adiabatic hot pressing technique, for microwave scattering measurements. Parameters, such as complex permittivity (Îµ'-jÎµ''), ac conductivity, skin thickness, transmission (S<21>), effective transmission loss (SE<T>), and shielding effectiveness were determined, in addition to dc conductivity. The real and imaginary component is increased, respectively, by ~ 5 and ~ 30 times, whereas, loss tangent by ~ 7, at 25 wt% loading of GNCs. The ac conductivity is enhanced from 0.248 (PU) to 7.288 (25 wt%) S/m by maximizing transmission loss to -26.45 dB (99.9%) and minimizing thickness to 1-2 millimeter. The dc percolation threshold is found low ~ 5 wt%, indicating superior dispersibility of GNCs, thereafter. In analysis, the atomic polarization (at ~ 10 GHz) associated with the aromatic urethane amide rings acts as a backbone to engage incident electromagnetic field wiggles. The coupling occurs via charge transfer polarization currents at doubly bonded nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrosorpted sp<3> carbon sites in GNCs. The field-matter interaction is dominant at the microvoid skin interface between GNCs and PU. Possible polarization mechanism is explained. The GNCs/PU nanocomposites are realized as an effective electromagnetic interference shielding block in tracking band. The details are presented.

Title #829: Biogenesis of reactive sulfur species for signaling by hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathways.
PMID: 26083070
Authors: Tatiana V TV. Mishanina, Marouane M. Libiad, Ruma R. Banerjee
Abstract: The chemical species involved in H2S signaling remain elusive despite the profound and pleiotropic physiological effects elicited by this molecule. The dominant candidate mechanism for sulfide signaling is persulfidation of target proteins. However, the relatively poor reactivity of H2S toward oxidized thiols, such as disulfides, the low concentration of disulfides in the reducing milieu of the cell and the low steady-state concentration of H2S raise questions about the plausibility of persulfide formation via reaction between an oxidized thiol and a sulfide anion or a reduced thiol and oxidized hydrogen disulfide. In contrast, sulfide oxidation pathways, considered to be primarily mechanisms for disposing of excess sulfide, generate a series of reactive sulfur species, including persulfides, polysulfides and thiosulfate, that could modify target proteins. We posit that sulfide oxidation pathways mediate sulfide signaling and that sulfurtransferases ensure target specificity.


Title #830: Calmodulin regulation of TMEM16A and 16B Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels.
PMID: 26083059
Authors: Tingting T. Yang, Henry M HM. Colecraft
Abstract: Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels encoded by TMEM16A and 16B are important for regulating epithelial mucus secretion, cardiac and neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory transduction, and cell proliferation. Whether and how the ubiquitous Ca(2+) sensor calmodulin (CaM) regulates the activity of TMEM16A and 16B channels has been controversial and the subject of an ongoing debate. Recently, using a bioengineering approach termed ChIMP (Channel Inactivation induced by Membrane-tethering of an associated Protein) we argued that Ca(2+)-free CaM (apoCaM) is pre-associated with functioning TMEM16A and 16B channel complexes in live cells. Further, the pre-associated apoCaM mediates Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) of some TMEM16A splice variants. In this review, we discuss these findings in the context of previous and recent results relating to Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels and the putative role of CaM. We further discuss potential future directions for these nascent ideas on apoCaM regulation of TMEM16A/16B channels, noting that such future efforts will benefit greatly from the pioneering work of Dr. David T. Yue and colleagues on CaM regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels.


Title #831: Quantification of Total Particulate Matter and Benzene-Soluble Fraction Inhalation Exposures in Roofing Workers Performing Tear-off Activities.
PMID: 26083058
Authors: Ronald H RH. Hill, John R JR. Ferraro, James L JL. Dodson, Edwin L EL. Hockman, Amy E AE. McGovern, William E WE. Fayerweather
Abstract: Asphalt shingle removal (tear-off) from roofs is a major job task for an estimated 174,000 roofers in the United States. However, a literature search showed that there are no published studies that characterize worker inhalation exposures to asphalt particulates during shingle tear-off. To begin to fill this gap, the present study of inhalation exposures of roofers performing asphalt shingle tear-off was undertaken. The airborne agents of interest were total particulate matter (TP) and organic particulates measured as the benzene-soluble fraction (BSF) of total particulate. The study's objectives were âto measure the personal breathing zone (PBZ) exposures of roofing tear-off workers to BSF and TP; and âto assess whether these PBZ exposures are different from ambient levels. Task-based PBZ samples (typical duration 1-5Â hours) were collected during asphalt shingle tear-off from roofs near Houston, Texas and Denver, Colorado. Samples were analyzed for TP and BSF using National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 5042. As controls, area samples (typical duration 3-6Â hours) were collected on the ground near the perimeter of the tear-off project Because of the presence of significant sources of inorganic particulates in the work environment, emphasis was placed on the BSF data. No BSF exposure higher than 0.25Â mg/m3 was observed, and 69% of the PBZ samples were below the limit of detection (LOD). Due to unforeseen confounding, however, statistical comparisons of on-the-roof PBZ samples with on-the-ground area samples posed some special challenges. This confounding grew out of the interaction of three factors: âstatistical censoring from the left; âthe strong inverse correlation between LOD concentration and sampling duration; and âvariation in sampling durations between on-the-ground area samples and on-the-roof PBZ samples. A general linear model analysis of variance (GLM-ANOVA) was applied to help address the confounding. The results of this analysis indicate that personal sample BSF results were not statistically significantly different from the background/area samples.


Title #832: An Integrated Device View on Photo-Electrochemical Solar-Hydrogen Generation.
PMID: 26083057
Authors: Miguel A MA. Modestino, Sophia S. Haussener
Abstract: Devices that directly capture and store solar energy have the potential to significantly increase the share of energy from intermittent renewable sources. Photo-electrochemical solar-hydrogen generators could become an important contributor, as these devices can convert solar energy into fuels that can be used throughout all sectors of energy. Rather than focusing on scientific achievement on the component level, this article reviews aspects of overall component integration in photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices that ultimately can lead to deployable devices. Throughout the article, three generalized categories of devices are considered with different levels of integration and spanning the range of complete integration by one-material photoelectrochemical approaches to complete decoupling by photovoltaics and electrolyzer devices. By using this generalized framework, we describe the physical aspects, device requirements, and practical implications involved with developing practical photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices. Aspects reviewed include macroscopic coupled multiphysics device models, physical device demonstrations, and economic and life cycle assessments, providing the grounds to draw conclusions on the overall technological outlook.

Title #833: Synthetic Biology for Specialty Chemicals.
PMID: 26083056
Authors: Kelly A KA. Markham, Hal S HS. Alper
Abstract: In this review, we address recent advances in the field of synthetic biology and describe how those tools have been applied to produce a wide variety of chemicals in microorganisms. Here we classify the expansion of the synthetic biology toolbox into three different categories based on their primary function in strain engineering-for design, for construction, and for optimization. Next, focusing on recent years, we look at how chemicals have been produced using these new synthetic biology tools. Advances in producing fuels are briefly described, followed by a more thorough treatment of commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. Throughout this review, an emphasis is placed on how synthetic biology tools are applied to strain engineering. Finally, we discuss organism and host strain diversity and provide a future outlook in the field. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Volume 6 is July 16, 2015.

Title #840: Progesterone and vitamin D combination therapy modulates inflammatory response after traumatic brain injury.
PMID: 26083048
Authors: Huiling H. Tang, Fang F. Hua, Jun J. Wang, Seema S. Yousuf, Fahim F. Atif, Iqbal I. Sayeed, Donald G DG. Stein
Abstract: Inflammation is an important component of the response to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Progesterone has been shown to inhibit neuroinflammation following (TBI) and may do so through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways. In vitro studies indicate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VDH) may also modulate the inflammatory response through the TLR4 pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that PROG and VDH would exert additive and synergistic neuroprotective effects compared with individual treatment by modulating TLR4/NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammation pathways after TBI in rats.

Title #844: Inverse-ordered fabrication of free-standing CNT sheets for supercapacitors.
PMID: 26083044
Authors: Youngmi Y. Koo, Vesselin V. Shanov, Sergey S. Yarmolenko, Mark J MJ. Schulz, Jagannathan J. Sankar, Y H YH. Yun
Abstract: Free-standing thin CNT sheets are challenged with handling and controlling for device fabrication and further transportation problem. In this paper, we report on the inverse-ordered fabrication method from thick carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets to thin free-standing CNT sheets. As proof of the concept, thin CNT sheets for supercapacitor were fabricated from thick 200 layers. The results show that thin CNT sheet was electrochemically stable and had enhanced capacitive performance. The smaller the number of layers is, the larger the specific capacitances we have (from 10.10 F g-1 to 51.37 F g-1). Energy and power density were increased from 0.50 to 2.57 Wh kg-1 and 0.33 to 2.31 kWkg-1 respectively. This simple and scalable inverse-ordered method is capable to fabricate CNT sheets in various forms, allowing fast trials on various applications.


Title #845: Gendering the Gift of Life: Family Politics and Kidney Donation in Egypt and Mexico.
PMID: 26083043
Authors: Megan M. Crowley-Matoka, Sherine F SF. Hamdy
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how living kidney donation is a particularly gendered experience. We draw on anthropologists' contributions to understanding the globalization of reproductive technologies, to argue that kidney donation similarly endangers and preserves fertility, thereby both unsettling and reifying gendered familial labor. Based upon fieldwork in two ethnographic sites -Egypt and Mexico - we examine how kidney donation is figured as a form of social reproduction. In both settings, kidney recipients rely almost exclusively on organs from living donors. We focus on how particular gender ideologies - as evident, for example, in the trope of the "self-sacrificing mother" - can serve as a cultural technology to generate donations in an otherwise organ-scarce medical setting. Alternatively, transplantation can disrupt gender norms and reproductive viability. In demonstrating the pervasiveness of gendered tropes in the realm of transplantation, we unsettle assumptions that the "family" as the locus of pure, altruistic donation.


Title #846: Calculation of lifetime lung cancer risks associated with radon exposure, based on various models and exposure scenarios.
PMID: 26083042
Authors: Nezahat N. Hunter, Colin R CR. Muirhead, Francesco F. Bochicchio, Richard G E RG. Haylock
Abstract: The risk of lung cancer mortality up to 75âyears of age due to radon exposure has been estimated for both male and female continuing, ex- and never-smokers, based on various radon risk models and exposure scenarios. We used risk models derived from (i) the BEIR VI analysis of cohorts of radon-exposed miners, (ii) cohort and nested case-control analyses of a European cohort of uranium miners and (iii) the joint analysis of European residential radon case-control studies. Estimates of the lifetime lung cancer risk due to radon varied between these models by just over a factor of 2 and risk estimates based on models from analyses of European uranium miners exposed at comparatively low rates and of people exposed to radon in homes were broadly compatible. For a given smoking category, there was not much difference in lifetime lung cancer risk between males and females. The estimated lifetime risk of radon-induced lung cancer for exposure to a concentration of 200âBqâm(-3) was in the range 2.98-6.55% for male continuing smokers and 0.19-0.42% for male never-smokers, depending on the model used and assuming a multiplicative relationship for the joint effect of radon and smoking. Stopping smoking at age 50âyears decreases the lifetime risk due to radon by around a half relative to continuing smoking, but the risk for ex-smokers remains about a factor of 5-7 higher than that for never-smokers. Under a sub-multiplicative model for the joint effect of radon and smoking, the lifetime risk of radon-induced lung cancer was still estimated to be substantially higher for continuing smokers than for never smokers. Radon mitigation-used to reduce radon concentrations at homes-can also have a substantial impact on lung cancer risk, even for persons in their 50âs; for each of continuing smokers, ex-smokers and never-smokers, radon mitigation at age 50 would lower the lifetime risk of radon-induced lung cancer by about one-third. To maximise risk reductions, smokers in high-radon homes should both stop smoking and remediate their homes.


Title #847: Anthocyanin and Carotenoid Contents in Different Cultivars of Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum Ramat.) Flower.
PMID: 26083041
Authors: Chang Ha CH. Park, Soo Cheon SC. Chae, Soo-Yun SY. Park, Jae Kwang JK. Kim, Yong Joo YJ. Kim, Sun Ok SO. Chung, Mariadhas Valan MV. Arasu, Naif Abdullah NA. Al-Dhabi, Sang Un SU. Park
Abstract: The flowers of twenty-three cultivars of Dendranthema grandiflorum Ramat. were investigated to determine anthocyanin and carotenoid levels and to confirm the effects of the pigments on the flower colors using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The cultivars contained the anthocyanins cyanidin 3-glucoside (C3g) and cyanidin 3-(3"-malonoyl) glucoside (C3mg) and the following carotenoids: lutein, zeaxanthin, Î²-cryptoxanthin, 13-cis-Î²-carotene, Î±-carotene, trans-Î²-carotene, and 9-cis-Î²-carotene. The cultivar "Magic" showed the greatest accumulation of total and individual anthocyanins, including C3g and C3gm. On the other hand, the highest level of lutein and zeaxanthin was noted in the cultivar "Il Weol". The cultivar "Anastasia" contained the highest amount of carotenoids such as trans-Î²-carotene, 9-cis-Î²-carotene, and 13-cis-Î²-carotene. The highest accumulation of Î²-cryptoxanthin and Î±-carotene was noted in the cultivar "Anastasia" and "Il Weol". Our results suggested that 'Magic", "Angel" and "Relance' had high amounts of anthocyanins and showed a wide range of red and purple colors in their petals, whereas "Il Weol', "Popcorn Ball' and "Anastasia" produced higher carotenoid contents and displayed yellow or green petal colors. Interestingly, "Green Pang Pang", which contained a high level of anthocyanins and a medium level of carotenoids, showed the deep green colored petals. "Kastelli", had high level of carotenoids as well as a medium level of anthocyanins and showed orange and red colored petals. It was concluded that each pigment is responsible for the petal's colors and the compositions of the pigments affect their flower colors and that the cultivars could be a good source for pharmaceutical, floriculture, and pigment industries.


Title #848: Negative-Pressure Cavitation Extraction of Secoisolariciresinol Diglycoside from Flaxseed Cakes.
PMID: 26083040
Authors: Hao H. Tian, Wan-Yi WY. Li, Dan D. Xiao, Zhi-Min ZM. Li, Jian-Wen JW. Wang
Abstract: The negative-pressure cavitation extraction (NPCE) technique was applied firstly to extract secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) from flaxseed cakes. The significant extraction parameters were screened by fractional factorial design (FFD). The optimal parameters were determined using the central composite design (CCD) with the two variables, NaOH amount and the liquid/solid ratio. The conditions of the extraction were optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yield and the extraction purity of SDG was 16.25 mg/g and 3.86%, respectively. The efficiency of NPCE was compared with that of conventional extraction methods. Our results demonstrated that NPCE was comparable to the well-known ultrasound-assisted extraction in term of extraction yield and purity. This extraction technique has advantages of less time-consuming, low solvent usage and high throughput capability.


Title #849: New Polyphenols Identified in Artemisiae abrotani herba Extract.
PMID: 26083039
Authors: Elisabeta E. Baiceanu, Laurian L. Vlase, Andrei A. Baiceanu, Madalina M. Nanes, Dan D. Rusu, Gianina G. Crisan
Abstract: Artemisia abrotanum L. ("southernwood") belongs to the Artemisia genus and it is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of illnesses. Scarce data is available on the chemical composition of this medicinal plant, most research being focused on the quantitative and qualitative analyses of its essential oil. Our aim was to investigate the content and profile of polyphenols, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic derivatives present in the Artemisiae abrotani herba extract. We conducted LC/MS analysis and we screened for 19 polyphenols, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic derivatives. We determined the total content of these compounds and we screened for antioxidant activity. Most polyphenol acids, hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavonoids were identified and quantified for the first time in this study. We found an original polyphenol distribution profile with high concentration of sinapic acid, rutin, quercetol, ferulic acid and patuletin. We measured the antioxidant activity, the ethanolic extract presenting a modest radical scavenging activity. The value of this study consists in its novelty as it adds new data on the chemical composition of A. abrotanum L. and it opens novel perspectives for medical and nutritional applications of this plant.


Title #850: Development of Orally Active Thrombin Inhibitors for the Treatment of Thrombotic Disorder Diseases.
PMID: 26083038
Authors: Li-Wei LW. He, Wei-Chen WC. Dai, Nian-Guang NG. Li
Abstract: Thrombotic disorders represent the major share of the various cardiovascular diseases, and significant progress has been made in the development of synthetic thrombin inhibitors as new anticoagulants. In addition to the development of highly potent and selective inhibitors with improved safety and suitable half-life, several allosteric inhibitors have been designed and synthesized, that did not fully nullify the procoagulant signal and thus could result in reduced bleeding complications. Furthermore, natural products with thrombin inhibitory activity have been isolated, and some natural products have been modified in order to improve their inhibitory activity and metabolic stability. This review summarizes the development of orally active thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of thrombotic disorder diseases, which could serve as a reference for the interested researchers.


Title #851: Physical Properties, Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activity of Chitosan Films Containing Carvacrol and Pomegranate Peel Extract.
PMID: 26083037
Authors: Gaofeng G. Yuan, Hua H. Lv, Bingjie B. Yang, Xiaoe X. Chen, Haiyan H. Sun
Abstract: Chitosan-based active films were developed by incorporation of carvacrol (10 g/L), pomegranate peel extract (PPE, 10 g/L) and carvacrol + PPE (10 g/L of each) and their physical, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties were investigated. Incorporation of carvacrol and carvacrol + PPE into the films significantly decreased the water vapor permeability, tensile strength and percentage of elongation at break. Incorporation of carvacrol, PPE and carvacrol + PPE into the films decreased the transparency, but significantly increased the total phenol content and antioxidant activity. All the films, with the exception of PPE-incorporated film, exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus of the film incorporated with carvacrol + PPE was moderately higher than that incorporated with carvacrol or PPE alone, suggesting a synergistic action between carvacrol and PPE.

Abstract: Accidental exposure to uranium is a matter of concern, as U(VI) is nephrotoxic in both human and animal models, and its toxicity is associated to chemical toxicity instead of radioactivity. We synthesized different PAMAM G4 and G5 derivatives in order to prove their interaction with uranium and their effect on the viability of red blood cells in vitro. Furthermore, we prove the effectiveness of the selected dendrimers in an animal model of acute uranium intoxication. The dendrimer PAMAM G4-Lys-Fmoc-Cbz demonstrated the ability to chelate the uranyl ion in vivo, improving the biochemical and histopathologic features caused by acute intoxication with uranium.

Abstract: Developed from crosses between Vitis vinifera and North American Vitis species, interspecific hybrid grape varieties are becoming economically significant in northern areas, where they are now extensively grown for wine production. However, the varietal differences between interspecific hybrids are not well defined, nor are the relationships between hybrid grape and wine composition, which causes significant drawbacks in the development of viticulture and winemaking of northern wines. In an effort to increase our understanding of interspecific hybrids, we have characterized the free volatile compounds profiles of berries (juice and skin) and wines of five red hybrid varieties (Frontenac, Marquette, MarÃ©chal Foch, Sabrevois and St. Croix) grown in QuÃ©bec (Canada), using GC-MS(TOF)-SPME. In grapes and wines, significantly higher levels of C6 and other fatty acid degradation products (FADP) were found in Frontenac, MarÃ©chal Foch and Marquette. Terpenes were primarily located in the skin, with Marquette showing the highest level for these compounds. Both the level of terpenes and the level of FADP in grape were strongly correlated with their respective levels in wine, as demonstrated by the redundancy analyses. Nonanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, Î²-damascenone, ethyl octanoate and isoamyl acetate showed the highest OAVs in the wines of the studied varieties.

Abstract: Domestic public debate continues over the economic impacts of environmental regulations that require environmental restoration. This debate has occurred in the absence of broad-scale empirical research on economic output and employment resulting from environmental restoration, restoration-related conservation, and mitigation actions - the activities that are part of what we term the "restoration economy." In this article, we provide a high-level accounting of the size and scope of the restoration economy in terms of employment, value added, and overall economic output on a national scale. We conducted a national survey of businesses that participate in restoration work in order to estimate the total sales and number of jobs directly associated with the restoration economy, and to provide a profile of this nascent sector in terms of type of restoration work, industrial classification, workforce needs, and growth potential. We use survey results as inputs into a national input-output model (IMPLAN 3.1) in order to estimate the indirect and induced economic impacts of restoration activities. Based on this analysis we conclude that the domestic ecological restoration sector directly employs ~ 126,000 workers and generates ~ $9.5 billion in economic output (sales) annually. This activity supports an additional 95,000 jobs and $15 billion in economic output through indirect (business-to-business) linkages and increased household spending.


Title #855: Prokaryotic Diversity in the Rhizosphere of Organic, Intensive, and Transitional Coffee Farms in Brazil.

Abstract: Despite a continuous rise in consumption of coffee over the past 60 years and recent studies showing positive benefits linked to human health, intensive coffee farming practices have been associated with environmental damage, risks to human health, and reductions in biodiversity. In contrast, organic farming has become an increasingly popular alternative, with both environmental and health benefits. This study aimed to characterize and determine the differences in the prokaryotic soil microbiology of three Brazilian coffee farms: one practicing intensive farming, one practicing organic farming, and one undergoing a transition from intensive to organic practices. Soil samples were collected from 20 coffee plant rhizospheres (soil directly influenced by the plant root exudates) and 10 control sites (soil 5 m away from the coffee plantation) at each of the three farms for a total of 90 samples. Profiling of 16S rRNA gene V4 regions revealed high levels of prokaryotic diversity in all three farms, with thousands of species level operational taxonomic units identified in each farm. Additionally, a statistically significant difference was found between each farm's coffee rhizosphere microbiome, as well as between coffee rhizosphere soils and control soils. Two groups of prokaryotes associated with the nitrogen cycle, the archaeal genus Candidatus Nitrososphaera and the bacterial order Rhizobiales were found to be abundant and statistically different in composition between the three farms and in inverse relationship to each other. Many of the nitrogen-fixing genera known to enhance plant growth were found in low numbers (e.g. Rhizobium, Agrobacter, Acetobacter, Rhodospirillum, Azospirillum), but the families in which they belong had some of the highest relative abundance in the dataset, suggesting many new groups may exist in these samples that can be further studied as potential plant growth-promoting bacteria to improve coffee production while diminishing negative environmental impacts.


Title #856: QuorUM: An Error Corrector for Illumina Reads.
PMID: 26083032
Authors: Guillaume G. MarÃ§ais, James A JA. Yorke, Aleksey A. Zimin
Abstract: Illumina Sequencing data can provide high coverage of a genome by relatively short (most often 100 bp to 150 bp) reads at a low cost. Even with low (advertised 1%) error rate, 100 Ã coverage Illumina data on average has an error in some read at every base in the genome. These errors make handling the data more complicated because they result in a large number of low-count erroneous k-mers in the reads. However, there is enough information in the reads to correct most of the sequencing errors, thus making subsequent use of the data (e.g. for mapping or assembly) easier. Here we use the term "error correction" to denote the reduction in errors due to both changes in individual bases and trimming of unusable sequence. We developed an error correction software called QuorUM. QuorUM is mainly aimed at error correcting Illumina reads for subsequent assembly. It is designed around the novel idea of minimizing the number of distinct erroneous k-mers in the output reads and preserving the most true k-mers, and we introduce a composite statistic Ï that measures how successful we are at achieving this dual goal. We evaluate the performance of QuorUM by correcting actual Illumina reads from genomes for which a reference assembly is available.

Title #858: Apolipoprotein D Transgenic Mice Develop Hepatic Steatosis through Activation of PPARÎ³ and Fatty Acid Uptake.
PMID: 26083030
Authors: Marilyne M. Labrie, Simon S. Lalonde, Ouafa O. Najyb, Maxime M. Thiery, Caroline C. Daneault, Chrisitne C. Des Rosiers, Eric E. Rassart, Catherine C. Mounier
Abstract: Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARÎ³ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARÎ³ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.


Title #859: Two Tickets to Paradise: Multiple Dispersal Events in the Founding of Hoary Bat Populations in Hawai'i.
PMID: 26083029

Abstract: The Hawaiian islands are an extremely isolated oceanic archipelago, and their fauna has long served as models of dispersal in island biogeography. While molecular data have recently been applied to investigate the timing and origin of dispersal events for several animal groups including birds, insects, and snails, these questions have been largely unaddressed in Hawai'i's only native terrestrial mammal, the Hawaiian hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus semotus. Here, we use molecular data to test the hypotheses that (1) Hawaiian L. c. semotus originated via dispersal from North American populations of L. c. cinereus rather than from South American L. c. villosissimus, and (2) modern Hawaiian populations were founded from a single dispersal event. Contrary to the latter hypothesis, our mitochondrial data support a biogeographic history of multiple, relatively recent dispersals of hoary bats from North America to the Hawaiian islands. Coalescent demographic analyses of multilocus data suggest that modern populations of Hawaiian hoary bats were founded no more than 10 kya. Our finding of multiple evolutionarily significant units in Hawai'i highlights information that should be useful for re-evaluation of the conservation status of hoary bats in Hawai'i.

Title #861: Influence of Hall Current and Viscous Dissipation on Pressure Driven Flow of Pseudoplastic Fluid with Heat Generation: A Mathematical Study.
PMID: 26083027
Authors: Saima S. Noreen, Muhammad M. Qasim
Abstract: In this paper, we study the influence of heat sink (or source) on the peristaltic motion of pseudoplastic fluid in the presence of Hall current, where channel walls are non-conducting in nature. Flow analysis has been carried out under the approximations of a low Reynolds number and long wavelength. Coupled equations are solved using shooting method for numerical solution for the axial velocity function, temperature and pressure gradient distributions. We analyze the influence of various interesting parameters on flow quantities. The present study can be considered as a mathematical presentation of the dynamics of physiological organs with stones.

Abstract: To translocation (externalization) of phosphatidylserine lead at least the five negative effects observed during cells cryopreservation: hypoxia, increasing of intracellular Ca2+, osmotic disruption of cellular membranes, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. The aim of this study was to test the intensiveness of the phosphatidylserine translocation immediately after thawing and after 45 d xenografting of human ovarian tissue, which was either frozen just after operative removal from patient or cooled before cryopreservation to 5Â°C for 24 h and then frozen.

Abstract: This study sought to assess the prevalence of common germline mutations in several genes engaged in the repair of DNA double-strand break by homologous recombination in patients with triple-negative breast cancers and hereditary non-triple-negative breast cancers. Tumors deficient in this type of DNA damage repair are known to be especially sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents (e.g., platinum drugs) and to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.


Title #864: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Safety of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Inhibitors for the Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity.

Abstract: Laser photocoagulation is the current gold standard treatment for proliferative retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, it permanently reduces the visual field and might induce myopia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for the treatment of ROP may enable continuing vascularization of the retina, potentially allowing the preservation of the visual field. However, for their use in infants concern remains. This meta-analysis explores the safety of VEGF inhibitors.


Title #865: Changes in the Distribution of Periodontal Nerve Fibers during Dentition Transition in the Cat.
PMID: 26083023

Abstract: The periodontal ligament has a rich sensory nerve supply which originates from the trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. Although various types of mechanoreceptors have been reported in the periodontal ligament, the Ruffini ending is an essential one. It is unknown whether the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous teeth is identical to that in permanent teeth or not. Moreover, morphological changes in the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers during resorption of deciduous teeth and eruption of successional permanent teeth in diphyodont animals have not been reported in detail. Therefore, in this study, we examined changes in the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in the cat during changes in dentition (i.e., deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition) by immunohistochemistry of protein gene product 9.5. During deciduous dentition, periodontal nerve fibers were concentrated at the apical portion, and sparsely distributed in the periodontal ligament of deciduous molars. During mixed dentition, the periodontal nerve fibers of deciduous molars showed degenerative profiles during resorption. In permanent dentition, the periodontal nerve fibers of permanent premolars, the successors of deciduous molars, increased in number. Similar to permanent premolars, the periodontal nerve fibers of permanent molars, having no predecessors, increased in number, and were densely present in the apical portion. The present results indicate that the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition is almost identical to that in permanent dentition although the number of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition was low. The sparse distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition agrees with clinical evidence that children are less sensitive to tooth stimulation than adults.


Title #866: Involvement of IL17A, IL17F and IL23R Polymorphisms in Colorectal Cancer Therapy.

Abstract: IL23/IL17 pathway plays an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In general, the genes encoding the cytokines are genetically polymorphic and polymorphisms in genes IL23R and IL17 have been proved to be associated with its susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as well as cancer including colorectal cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that these interleukins are involved in anti-tumor or pro-tumor effects of various cancers. Previously, we showed that there is a significant association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms as well as the occurrence of colorectal cancer and the clinical features of the disease. The purpose of the present work is to investigate an association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms in 102 Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer treatment. The association was analyzed by statistical tools. We found that patients with mutated genotypes of IL17A G197A SNP could be a risk factor for the inefficiency of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike IL17F variant, patients with wild type genotypes require surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. On the one hand, we found no evidence that supports a significant association between IL23R polymorphism and the combined genotypes of these three genes and the colorectal cancer treatment. On the other hand, we showed that there is an important interaction between IL17A/IL17F polymorphisms and the stage of the disease as well as its treatment. Finally, patients with IL17F wild type genotype highlighted that there is a valid longer OS without all treatments and with radiotherapy and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, we observed that there are no relationships between IL17A, IL23R and the survival of these patients neither with nor without the treatment. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes may be a predictive source of colorectal cancer therapy type. Therefore, IL17F may serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer.


Title #867: Thymosin Beta-4 Induces Mouse Hair Growth.
PMID: 26083021
Authors: Xiaoyu X. Gao, Hao H. Liang, Fang F. Hou, Zhipeng Z. Zhang, Mingtu M. Nuo, Xudong X. Guo, Dongjun D. Liu
Abstract: Thymosin beta-4 (TÎ²4) is known to induce hair growth and hair follicle (HF) development; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. We generated mice that overexpressed TÎ²4 in the epidermis, as well as TÎ²4 global knockout mice, to study the role of TÎ²4 in HF development and explore the mechanism of TÎ²4 on hair growth. To study TÎ²4 function, we depilated control and experimental mice and made tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To explore the effect of TÎ²4 on hair growth and HF development, the mRNA and protein levels of TÎ²4 and VEGF were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting in control and experimental mice. Protein expression levels and the phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT were also examined by western blotting. The results of depilation indicated that hair re-growth was faster in TÎ²4-overexpressing mice, but slower in knockout mice. Histological examination revealed that TÎ²4-overexpressing mice had a higher number of hair shafts and HFs clustered together to form groups, while the HFs of control mice and knockout mice were separate. Hair shafts in knockout mice were significantly reduced in number compared with control mice. Increased TÎ²4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in TÎ²4-overexpressing mice, which also had increased VEGF expression. On the other hand, knockout mice had reduced levels of VEGF expression. Mechanistically, TÎ²4-overexpressing mice showed increased protein expression levels and phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT, whereas knockout mice had decreased levels of both expression and phosphorylation of these proteins. TÎ²4 appears to regulate P38/ERK/AKT signaling via its effect on VEGF expression, with a resultant effect on the speed of hair growth, the pattern of HFs and the number of hair shafts.


Title #868: Loss of Melanopsin Photoreception and Antagonism of the Histamine H3 Receptor by Ciproxifan Inhibit Light-Induced Sleep in Mice.
PMID: 26083020
Authors: Fanuel F. Muindi, Damien D. Colas, Jesse J. Ikeme, Norman F NF. Ruby, H Craig HC. Heller
Abstract: Light has direct effects on sleep and wakefulness causing arousal in diurnal animals and sleep in nocturnal animals. In the present study, we assessed the modulation of light-induced sleep by melanopsin and the histaminergic system by exposing mice to millisecond light flashes and continuous light respectively. First, we show that the induction of sleep by millisecond light flashes is dose dependent as a function of light flash number. We found that exposure to 60 flashes of light occurring once every 60 seconds for 1-h (120-ms of total light over an hour) induced a similar amount of sleep as a continuous bright light pulse. Secondly, the induction of sleep by millisecond light flashes was attenuated in the absence of melanopsin when animals were presented with flashes occurring every 60 seconds over a 3-h period beginning at ZT13. Lastly, the acute administration of a histamine H3 autoreceptor antagonist, ciproxifan, blocked the induction of sleep by a 1-h continuous light pulse during the dark period. Ciproxifan caused a decrease in NREMS delta power and an increase in theta activity during both sleep and wake periods respectively. The data suggest that some form of temporal integration occurs in response to millisecond light flashes, and that this process requires melanopsin photoreception. Furthermore, the pharmacological data suggest that the increase of histaminergic neurotransmission is sufficient to attenuate the light-induced sleep response during the dark period.


Title #869: Living on the Edge: Settlement Patterns by the Symbiotic Barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis on Small Cetaceans.
PMID: 26083019
Authors: Juan M JM. Carrillo, Robin M RM. Overstreet, Juan A JA. Raga, Francisco J FJ. Aznar
Abstract: The highly specialized coronulid barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis attaches exclusively on cetaceans worldwide, but little is known about the factors that drive the microhabitat patterns on its hosts. We investigate this issue based on data on occurrence, abundance, distribution, orientation, and size of X. globicipitis collected from 242 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) that were stranded along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Barnacles exclusively infested the fins, particularly along the trailing edge. Occurrence, abundance, and density of X. globicipitis were significantly higher, and barnacles were significantly larger, on the caudal fin than on the flippers and dorsal fin. Barnacles were found more frequently and in greater numbers on the dorsal rather than ventral side of the caudal fin and on the central third of dorsal and ventral fluke surfaces. Nearly all examined individuals attached with their cirral fan oriented opposite to the fluke edge. We suggest that X. globicipitis may chemically recognize dolphins as a substratum, but fins, particularly the flukes, are passively selected because of creation of vortices that increase contact of cyprids with skin and early survival of these larvae at the corresponding sites. Cyprids could actively select the trailing edge and orient with the cirri facing the main direction of flow. Attachment on the dorsal side of the flukes is likely associated with asymmetrical oscillation of the caudal fin, and the main presence on the central segment of the flukes could be related to suitable water flow conditions generated by fluke performance for both settlement and nutrient filtration.

Candidate Ara-C metabolizing gene expression in primary AML cells is proposed to account for this variation.


Title #872: Differentiation of Whole Grain Wheat Flour from Refined Wheat Flour Using Lipid Profile of Wheat Bran, Germ, and Endosperm with UHPLC- HRAM Mass Spectrometry.
PMID: 26083013
Authors: Ping P. Geng, James M JM. Harnly, Pei P. Chen
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of wheat lipids from milling fractions of bran, germ, and endosperm was performed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution accurate-mass multi-stage mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRAM-MSn) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in both positive and negative modes. Major lipid classes, including free fatty acids, oxylipins, alk (en) ylresorcinols, Î³-oryzanol, sphingolipids, triglycerides, diglycerides, phospholipids, and galactolipids were characterized. About 155 lipid compounds were tentatively identified in the three milling fractions. Although they shared most of the components, neutral lipids were most abundant in germ, galactolipids and phospholipids were most abundant in endosperm, Î³-oryzanols and alk(en)ylresorcinols were most abundant in bran. The uneven distribution of lipids in wheat structural parts demonstrated the possibility of differentiating whole and refined wheat flour by components fingerprints.


Title #873: Fabrication of Chiral Materials via Self-Assembly and Biomineralization of Peptides.
PMID: 26083010
Authors: Zhehao Z. Huang, Shunai S. Che
Abstract: With different scales of chirality, chiral materials have various particular properties and potential applications in many fields. Peptides are the fundamental building units of biological systems, and a variety of ordered functional nanostructures are produced through self-assembly and biomineralization of peptides in nature. This Personal Account describes chiral silica materials fabricated by using amphiphilic peptides as building blocks. Three particular biomineralization approaches are described based on different kinds of geometry of amphiphilic peptides: the influence of the specific amino acid proline in the peptide sequence, the hydrophilicity of amphiphilic peptides, and different kinds of hydrophobic tails in amphiphilic peptides. These strategies are useful for designing peptides toward the bottom-up synthesis of nanomaterials as well as improving the understanding of the mechanism of peptide self-assembly.


Title #874: Modeling the Kinetic Diversity of Dopamine in the Dorsal Striatum.
PMID: 26083009
Authors: Seth Holt SH. Walters, Elaine Marie EM. Robbins, Adrian Charles AC. Michael
Abstract: Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that exhibits numerous functions in the healthy, injured, and diseased brain. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry paired with electrical stimulation of dopamine axons is a popular and powerful method for investigating the dynamics of dopamine in the extracellular space. Evidence now suggests that the heterogeneity of electrically evoked dopamine responses reflects the inherent kinetic diversity of dopamine systems, which might contribute to their diversity of physiological function. Dopamine measurements by fast scan cyclic voltammetry are affected by the adsorption of dopamine to carbon fiber electrodes. The temporal distortion caused by dopamine adsorption is correctable by a straightforward mathematical procedure. The corrected responses exhibit excellent agreement with a kinetic model cast to provide a generic description of restricted diffusion and short-term plasticity of dopamine release. The restricted diffusion model brings to light the rich kinetic information content of electrically evoked dopamine responses recorded in the rat dorsal striatum.


Title #875: Assessment of elasticity of colorectal cancer tissue, clinical utility, pathological and phenotypical relevance.

Abstract: Generally, cancer tissue is palpated as a hard mass. However, the elastic nature of cancer tissue is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of measuring the elastic modulus (EM) in colorectal cancer tissue. Using a tactile sensor, we measured the EM of 106 surgically resected colorectal cancer tissues. Data on the EM were compared with clinicopathological findings, including stromal features represented by Azan staining and the Î±-SMA positive area ratio of the tumor area. Finally, a cDNA microarray profile of the tumors with high EM were compared with the findings of tumors with low EM. A higher EM in tumors was associated with pathological T-, N-, and M-stage tumors (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.011, respectively). Patients with high EM tumors had shorter disease-free survival than had patients with low EM. The EM showed strongly positive correlation with the Azan staining positive area ratio (r = 0.908) and Î±-SMA positive area ratio (r = 0.921). Finally, the cDNA microarray data of the tumors with high EM revealed a distinct gene expression profile compared with data from those tumors with low EM. The assessment of the elasticity of colorectal cancer tissue may allow a more accurate clinical stage or prognosis estimation. The distinct phenotypical features of the high EM tumors and their strong association with stromal features suggest the existence of a biological mechanism involved in this phenomenon that may contribute to future therapy.

Title #876: Amine enrichment of thin-film composite membranes via low pressure plasma for anti-microbial adhesion.
PMID: 26083007

Abstract: Thin film composite membranes, primarily based on poly(amide) semi-permeable materials, are nowadays the dominant technology used in pressure driven water desalination systems. Despite offering superior water permeation and salt selectivity, their surface properties, such as their charge and roughness cannot be extensively tuned due to the intrinsic fabrication process of the membranes by interfacial polymerization. The alteration of these properties would lead to a better control of the materials surface zeta potential, which is critical to finely tune selectivity and enhance the membrane materials stability when exposed to complex industrial waste streams. Low pressure plasma was employed to introduce amine functionalities onto the poly(amide) (PA) surface of a commercially available thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. Morphological changes after plasma were analyzed by SEM and AFM with average surface roughness decreased by 29%. Amine enrichment provided isoelectric point changing from pH 3.7 to 5.2 for 5 to 15 min of plasma polymerization time. Synchrotron FTIR mappings of the amine-modified surface, indicated the addition of a discrete 60 nm film to the PA layer. Furthermore, metal affinity was confirmed by the enhanced binding of silver to the modified surface, supported by an increased antimicrobial functionality with demonstrable elimination of E.coli growth. Essential salt rejection was shown minimally compromised for faster polymerization process. Plasma polymerization is therefore a viable route to producing functional amine enriched thin-film composite PA membrane surfaces.

Abstract: The currently advocated rabies post-exposure prophylaxis regimens are of one month duration with reduced patient compliance. WHO recommended research on shortened vaccination regimens which have a practical and economic advantage over the existing regimens. Hence, the present study was undertaken to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two WHO prequalified rabies vaccines administered by one week, 4Â site intra dermal regimen (4-4-4-0-0) in animal bite cases. This study was a comparative, open label, phase III, randomized clinical trial conducted at Anti rabies clinic, KIMS Hospital, Bangalore, India. The study was registered in Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI) bearing the registration number CTRI/2012/12/003230. Ninety subjects with category II/III animal bites/exposures were enrolled. Equine rabies immunoglobulin was administered to all category III exposures. 0.1Â mL of either purified chick embryo cell vaccine (Rabipur) or purified verocell rabies vaccine (Verorab) was administered intradermally into 4Â sites on days 0, 3 and 7 to all the study subjects. Serum of subjects collected on day 0, 14, 90 and 365 were analyzed for rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentration. The incidence of ADR in Rabipur and Verorab group was 2.96% and 1.14% respectively. In Rabipur group, geometric mean concentration (95% confidence interval) of RVNA was 14.5 (13.50,15.57), 11.78 (11.27,12.31) and 5.95 (5.50, 6.44) IU/mL on days 14, 90 and 365 respectively; In Verorab group geometric mean concentration (95% confidence interval) of RVNA was 14.43 (13.41,15.53), 11.93 (11.47,12.40) and 5.67 (5.29,6.08) IU/mL on days 14, 90 and 365 respectively. In conclusion, Rabipur and Verorab were found to be safe, immunogenic and comparable with each other, when administered using one week, 4Â site intradermal regimen (4-4-4-0-0) in animal bite cases.

Abstract: The term 'oral health care for older adults' has various interpretations, and its meaning is not clear among dental school academic staff. Additionally, there are no theoretical or practical stand-alone courses on oral health care for older adults in Japanese dental schools. To improve oral health care education, we investigated the opinions and attitudes toward oral health care education for older adults among academic staff in dental schools. Data were collected in seven dental schools from May to September 2013 via an online questionnaire survey. Five-hundred-fifty-eight academics (428 male, 130 female) participated (response rate 57%). The average number of years since they had completed a university degree was 20.2 (SD 10.2) years. The majority (Over 90%) of participants perceived that oral health care should be provided in nursing facilities, hospitals, and at home. Its treatments and instructions should include, not only methods of keeping good oral hygiene, but also improvement of oral function such as swallowing training and salivary glands massage. The majority (84.2%) suggested oral health care education should be combined as a one-credit, stand-alone course. Findings indicate that dental academics have an understanding the need for a course in oral health care for older adults. Participants supported the need for further development of education in oral health care for older adults' in Japan, as a separate course on its own right. However there were some different views about content by teaching field. The need for a national core program for teaching oral health care education was suggested.

Title #881: Solid state transformation of the crystalline monohydrate (CH3NH3)PbI3(H2O) to the (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite.
PMID: 26083000

Abstract: Colorless crystals of (CH3NH3Â·H2O)PbI3 spontaneously lose water at 298 K which triggers a transformation to the black (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite in the solid state as a porous microcrystalline solid with nanoscale substructure, but the dihydrate (CH3NH3)4PbI6Â·2H2O) requires much more forcing conditions to produce (CH3NH3)PbI3.


Title #882: Highly water-soluble and tumor-targeted photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.

Abstract: Biological uses of photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) often suffer from a lack of tumor selectivity; a strategy based on molecule-targeted cancer therapies could provide a promising solution. To synthesize new water-soluble phthalocyanines (Pcs) for bio-conjugation with peptides or antibodies, we developed a method to synthesize asymmetrically substituted Pcs with both high water solubility and one monoamino group for conjugation with biological agents for tumor homing, using folic acid as the ligand model to direct the modified Pcs into target cells. Here, we report studies on the syntheses and characterization of these Pcs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the high solubility characteristic can greatly increase the tumor targeting capability of Pcs by reducing non-specific uptake. This newly designed photosensitizer accumulated almost completely in tumor regions, with a negligible signal found in other tissues in the xenograft tumor model. These initial data provide strong evidence of the high specificity tumor targeting of Pcs with folate and tri-glycerol substitutions. Theoretically, the synthesized Pcs could be conveniently conjugated to many other ligands, endorsing the broad applicability of this method for tumor-targeted PDT.


Title #883: Succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II) is a source of reactive oxygen species in plants and regulates development and stress responses.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules that regulate plant development and responses to stresses. Mitochondria are the source of most ROS in heterotrophic cells, and mitochondrial complex I and complex III are regarded as the main sites of ROS production in plant mitochondria. Recent studies have demonstrated that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) also contributes to mitochondrial ROS production. However, the ability of SDH to generate ROS in plants is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SDH in mitochondrial ROS production. Our results demonstrated that SDH is a direct source of ROS in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, and the induction of ROS production by specific SDH inhibitors impaired plant growth. In addition, this effect was accompanied by the down-regulation of cell cycle genes and the up-regulation of stress-related genes. However, the partial inhibition of SDH by a competitive inhibitor decreased ROS production, which was associated with increased shoot and root growth, and prevented the down-regulation of cell cycle genes and the induction of stress-related genes by noncompetitive inhibitors. In conclusion, SDH plays an important role in ROS production, being a direct source of ROS in plant mitochondria and regulating plant development and stress responses.


Title #884: Stimulation of PAR-1 or PAR-4 promotes similar pattern of VEGF and endostatin release and pro-angiogenic responses mediated by human platelets.
PMID: 26082997
Authors: J. J. Etulain, H A HA. Mena, S. S. Negrotto, M. M. Schattner
Abstract: Platelets mediate angiogenesis through the secretion of several factors, including the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the anti-angiogenic endostatin. Although previous findings indicated that these molecules are packed into different alpha-granules and selectively released by specific stimulation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 or PAR-4, recent evidences are against this hypothesis.


Title #885: Water-Methanol Mixtures: Simulations of Mixing Properties over the Entire Range of Mole Fractions.
PMID: 26082996
Authors: Jean-Christophe JC. Soetens, Philippe Anthony PA. Bopp
Abstract: Numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to the hydrogen bond in pure liquids and mixtures. Among the different theoretical approaches Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations is the predominant one to obtain detailed information, at the molecular level, simultaneously on the structure and the dynamics. Water and methanol are the two most prominent hydrogen-bonded liquids, they and their mixtures have consequently been the subject of many studies; we revisit here the problem of the mixtures. An important first step is to check whether a classical potential model, the components of which are deemed to be satisfactory for the pure liquids, is able to reproduce the known thermodynamic excess properties of the mixtures sufficiently well. We have used the available BJH (water) and PHH (methanol) flexible models, since they are by construction mutually compatible and also well suited to study, in a second step, some dynamic properties characteristic of hydrogen-bonded liquids. In this paper we show that these models, after a slight re-parametrization for use in NpT-simulations, reproduce the essential features of the excess mixing and molar properties of water-methanol mixtures. Furthermore, in the pure liquids, the agreement of the radial distribution functions with experiment remains as satisfactory as before. Similarly, the translations self-diffusion coefficients D are modified by less than 10 %. In the mixtures, they evolve non-monotonously as a function of mole fraction.

Title #887: Healthcare Laundry and Textiles in the United States: Review and Commentary on Contemporary Infection Prevention Issues.
PMID: 26082994
Authors: Lynne M LM. Sehulster
Abstract: Healthcare professionals have questions about the infection prevention effectiveness of contemporary laundry processes for healthcare textiles (HCTs). Current industrial laundry processes achieve microbial reductions via physical, chemical, and thermal actions, all of which result in producing hygienically clean HCTs. European researchers have demonstrated that oxidative laundry additives have sufficient potency to meet US Environmental Protection Agency benchmarks for sanitizers and disinfectants. Outbreaks of infectious diseases associated with laundered HCTs are extremely rare; only 12 such outbreaks have been reported worldwide in the past 43 years. Root cause analyses have identified inadvertent exposure of clean HCTs to environmental contamination (including but not limited to exposure to dust in storage areas) or a process failure during laundering. To date, patient-to-patient transmission of infection has not been associated with hygienically clean HCTs laundered in accordance with industry process standards. Occupationally acquired infection involved mishandling of soiled HCTs and failure to use personal protective equipment properly. Laboratory studies of antimicrobial treatments for HCTs demonstrate a wide range of activity from 1 to 7 log10 reduction of pathogens under various experimental conditions. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate potential use of these treatments for infection prevention. Microbiological testing of clean HCTs for certification purposes is now available in the United States. Key features (eg, microbial sampling strategy, numbers of textiles sampled) and justification of the testing are discussed. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2015;00(0):1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½16.


Title #888: Risk of mortality from circulatory diseases in Mayak workers cohort following occupational radiation exposure.
PMID: 26082993
Authors: T V TV. Azizova, E S ES. Grigorieva, N. N. Hunter, M V MV. Pikulina, M B MB. Moseeva
Abstract: Mortality from circulatory diseases (CD) (ICD-9 codes 390-459) was studied in an extended Mayak worker cohort, which included 22â377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association in 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2008. The enlarged cohort and extended follow-up as compared to the previous analyses provided an increased number of deaths from CD and improved statistical power of this mortality study. The analyses were based on dose estimates provided by a new Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time in the study of non-cancer effects in this cohort quantitative smoking data (smoking index) were taken into account. A significant increasing trend for CD mortality with increasing dose from external gamma-rays was found after having adjusted for non-radiation factors; the excess relative risk per unit dose (ERR/Gy) was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI):ââ>0, 0.11). Inclusion of an additional adjustment for dose from internal alpha-radiation to the liver resulted in a two-fold increase of ERR/Gy = 0.10 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.21). A significant increasing trend in CD mortality with increasing dose from internal alpha-radiation to the liver was observed (ERR/Gy = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.48). However the ERR/Gy decreased and lost its significance after adjusting for dose from external gamma-rays. Results of the current study are in good agreement with risk estimates obtained for the Japanese LSS cohort as well as other studies of cohorts of nuclear workers.


Title #889: The effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on mechanical and thermal thresholds in 6OHDA lesioned rats.

Abstract: Chronic pain is a major complaint for up to 85% of Parkinson Disease patients, however, often not identified as a symptom of Parkinson's disease. Adequate treatment of motor symptoms often provides analgesic effects in Parkinson's patients, how this occurs remains unclear. Studies have shown both Parkinson's patients and 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats exhibit decreased sensory thresholds. In humans, some show improvements in these deficits after subthalamic deep brain stimulation, while others report no change. Differing methods of testing and response criteria may explain these varying results. We examined this effect in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats. Sprague dawley rats were unilaterally implanted with subthalamic stimulating electrodes in the lesioned right hemisphere and sensory thresholds were tested using vonFrey, tail flick and hot plate tests. Tests were done during and off subthalamic stimulation at 50 and 150Hz to assess its effects on sensory thresholds. 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned animals exhibited lower mechanical (left paw, p<0.01) and thermal thresholds than shams (hot plate, p<0.05). Both 50 and 150Hz increased mechanical (left paw; p<0.01) and thermal thresholds in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats (HPT; 150Hz, p<0.05, 50Hz, p<0.01). Interestingly, the magnitude of improvement in mechanical thresholds during LFS was similar between animals, whereas during HFS was much more diverse. This study shows that subthalamic deep brain stimulation improves mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned animals at both high and low frequencies. Furthermore, we suggest considering using low frequency stimulation when treating Parkinson's patients where pain remains the predominant complaint. This article is protected by copyright.

Title #891: Functional Genomics of the Aeromonas salmonicida Lipopolysaccharide O-Antigen and A-Layer from Typical and Atypical Strains.
PMID: 26082990
Authors: Susana S. Merino, Elena E. de Mendoza, RocÃ­o R. Canals, Juan M JM. TomÃ¡s
Abstract: The A. salmonicida A450 LPS O-antigen, encoded by the wbsalmo gene cluster, is exported through an ABC-2 transporter-dependent pathway. It represents the first example of an O-antigen LPS polysaccharide with three different monosaccharides in their repeating unit assembled by this pathway. Until now, only repeating units with one or two different monosaccharides have been described. Functional genomic analysis of this wbsalmo region is mostly in agreement with the LPS O-antigen structure of acetylated l-rhamnose (Rha), d-glucose (Glc), and 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-mannose (ManN). Between genes of the wbsalmo we found the genes responsible for the biosynthesis and assembly of the S-layer (named A-layer in these strains). Through comparative genomic analysis and in-frame deletions of some of the genes, we concluded that all the A. salmonicida typical and atypical strains, other than A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica strains, shared the same wbsalmo and presence of A-layer. A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica strains lack wbsalmo and A-layer, two major virulence factors, and this could be the reason they are the only ones not found as fish pathogens.


Title #892: A New Meroditerpene and a New Tryptoquivaline Analog from the Algicolous Fungus Neosartorya takakii KUFC 7898.

Abstract: A new meroditerpene sartorenol (1), a new natural product takakiamide (2) and a new tryptoquivaline analog (3) were isolated, together with nine known compounds, including aszonapyrone A, chevalone B, aszonalenin, acetylaszonalenin, 3'-(4-oxoquinazolin-3-yl) spiro[1H-indole-3,5'-oxolane]-2,2'-dione, tryptoquivalines L, F and H, and the isocoumarin derivative, 6-hydroxymellein, from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of the algicolous fungus Neosartorya takakii KUFC 7898. The structures of the new compounds were established based on 1D and 2D NMR spectral analysis, and, in the case of sartorenol (1) and tryptoquivaline U (3), X-ray analysis was used to confirm their structures and to determine the absolute configuration of their stereogenic carbons. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant isolates from the environment; however, none exhibited antibacterial activity (MIC Ë 256 mg/mL). The three new compounds did not show any quorum sensing inhibition in the screening protocol based on the pigment production by Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 31532).


Title #893: Antioxidant Potential of White Oyster Culinary-Medicinal Mushroom, Pleurotus florida (Higher Basidiomycetes).
PMID: 26082988
Authors: Aditya A. Ganeshpurkar, Priya P. Pardhi, Santosh Singh SS. Bhadoriya, Nikhil N. Jain, Gopal G. Rai, Alok Pal AP. Jain
Abstract: The present work was focused to evaluate in vitro antioxidant of Pleurotus florida. The hydroethanolic extract was prepared by macerating basidiocarp with water:ethanol (1:1). The antioxidant potential was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, reducing power, chelating effects on ferrous ions, total antioxidant capacity, and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity. Further total flavonoid and phenolic content was also estimated. The comparison between different antioxidant assays was done by correlation coefficient. The results from the antioxidant assays showed that hydroethanolic extract (HEE) might act as radical scavenger to a certain extent. The distinct scavenging activities of HEE can be due to the diverse phytochemical constituents. Being a rich source of antioxidants, P. florida can be used as an accessible source of natural antioxidants with consequential health benefits.


Title #894: Comparative Study of Worldwide Species of Genus Lentinus (=Lentinula, Higher Basidiomycetes) Based on Linear Mycelium Growth.
PMID: 26082987
Authors: Juan Luis JL. Mata, Nutan Tulapurkar NT. Mishra
Abstract: Species of mushroom genus Lentinus (=Lentinula) are best known for the commercially important and extensively studied culinary-medicinal shiitake, L. edodes. A few mycelium growth studies have focused on Lentinus boryana, but information is lacking for L. raphanica and L. aciculospora, endemic to the Americas. In this study, 14 dikaryon strains representing 5 Lentinus species were grown on 5 nutritive agar media at increments of 5Â°C. Growth for each species was significantly slower on corn meal agar, but no differences were found among malt extract, potato dextrose, malt peptone, and yeast malt extract agars. Lentinus aciculospora and L. boryana consistently exhibited the slowest mycelium growth rates among all species and across all temperatures tested, with optima at 15Â°C and 20Â°C. The fastest mycelium growth rates for L. edodes, L. novaezelandiae, and L. raphanica occurred at 25Â°C. Strains of the latter continued to grow well at 30Â°C, whereas growth of the other 2 species declined significantly. Differences in mycelium growth rates for American strains could be partially explained by their geographic locations, indicating that understanding this physiological parameter has important ramifications for the edible mushroom industry.


Title #895: Medicinal Mushroom Extracts Possess Differential Antioxidant Activity and Cytotoxicity to Cancer Cells.
PMID: 26082986

Abstract: Many species of edible mushrooms are known to contain a wide array of compounds with high nutritional and medicinal values. However, these values vary widely among mushroom species because of the wide diversity of compounds with different solubilities to solvents used in extraction. We report here the comparison of antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity against cancer cells in extracts of Pleurotus ostreatus, P. sajor-caju, Agaricus campestris, and A. bisporus from 7 different solvents, including water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, chloroform, hexane, and petroleum ether. The extracts were analyzed for their antioxidant activities using the % DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate) scavenging activity method. Our results revealed that the water extracts exhibited the highest % DPPH scavenging activity in comparison to all other solvent extracts. The highest value was obtained from the water extract of P. sajor-caju (78.1%), and the lowest one was from the hexane extract of A. bisporus (0.8%). In general, extracts from nonpolar solvents exhibited much lower antioxidant activities than those from polar solvents. The cytotoxic effects of these extracts were evaluated using 2 cancer cell lines of larynx carcinoma (HEp-2) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7). When added into Hep-2 cells, the hexane extracts from P. ostreatus, P. sajor-caju, A. bisporus, and A. campestris yielded the highest IC50 values of 1.7 Â± 1.56, 2.1 Â± 2.82, 4.4 Â± 1.71, and 2.2 Â± 1.34 Î¼g/mL, respectively, in comparison to all other solvent extracts. Similar IC50 values were obtained when the MCF-2 cancer cells were tested, suggesting that hexane is the preferred solvent to extract the anticancer compounds from these mushrooms. Our results also indicated that extracts from solvents with nonpolar or intermediate polarity were more potent than those with high polarity in their cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and extracts from different mushrooms by the same solvent possessed varied degrees of cytotoxicity.


Title #896: Influence of Navisporus floccosus (Higher Basidiomycetes) n-Hexane Extract on Arachidonate Metabolism in Vitro.
PMID: 26082985
Authors: Vivian V. Leliebre-Lara, Eva-Maria EM. Pferschy-Wenzig, Ute U. Widowitz, Sabine S. Ortmann, Clara Nogueiras CN. Lima, Rudolf R. Bauer
Abstract: In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of 4 extracts with different polarity from the basidiomycete Navisporus floccosus was evaluated by determination of the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 formation catalyzed by purified cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzymes, and of the inhibition of leukotriene (LT) B4 formation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The n-hexane extract showed the highest activity in all 3 assays. Through analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), 9 fatty acids and fatty acid esters were identified as the major constituents of this extract. As several of them also showed inhibitory activity in the COX and LTB4 formation assays, it can be assumed that the unsaturated as well as the saturated fatty acids, and maybe also the fatty acid esters, present in the extract synergistically contribute to its in vitro anti-inflammatory activity.


Title #897: Antiproliferative Activities of Hot Water Extracts from Culinary-Medicinal Mushrooms, Ganoderma tsugae and Agrocybe cylindracea (Higher Basidiomycetes) on Cancer Cells.
PMID: 26082984
Authors: Rao-Chi RC. Chien, Shu-Yao SY. Tsai, Eric Yih-Cherng EY. Lai, Jeng-Leun JL. Mau
Abstract: Using anticancer agents to progress chemotherapy to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells is an effective means. Two medicinal mushrooms, Ganoderma tsugae and Agrocybe cylindracea, exhibited various physiological effects, and the antiproliferation effect on HL-60, Hep 3B, and C6 cells was studied. The viability of different cancer cells was decreased significantly by hot water extracts from different forms of G. tsugae and A. cylindracea. The hot water extracts from the fruit body, mycelium, and filtrate of A. cylindracea were less effective in inhibiting the antiproliferation of C6, Hep 3B, and HL-60 cells than were those from G. tsugae, as evidenced by their IC50 values. The IC50 values of G. tsugae on C6, Hep 3B, and HL-60 cells were 1.13, 2.73, and 2.60 mg/mL, respectively, whereas those of baby G. tsugae were 1.87, 2.63, and 3.12 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, the filtrates of G. tsugae on C6 and Hep 3B cells were 2.81 and 2.80 mg/mL, respectively. The morphological transformation of 3 cancer cells was observed clearly, and the possible mechanism would be necrosis, apoptosis, or differentiation. Owing to the noticeable effect on antiproliferation of hot water extracts, especially those from G. tsugae, the extract could be of great potential to be used as an alternative cancer therapy.


Title #898: Chemical Compositions and Macrophage Activation of Polysaccharides from Leon's Mane Culinary-Medicinal Mushroom Hericium erinaceus (Higher Basidiomycetes) in Different Maturation Stages.
PMID: 26082983
Authors: Qiao-Zhen QZ. Li, Di D. Wu, Xia X. Chen, Shuai S. Zhou, Yanfang Y. Liu, Yan Y. Yang, Fengjie F. Cui
Abstract: We studied the effect of the maturation stage on the chemical compositions and macrophage activation activity of polysaccharides from the culinary-medicinal mushroom Hericium erinaceus. Results showed that total polysaccharides increased, whereas protein content decreased with the maturation stage development of fruiting body. Nine polysaccharide fractions, 3 from each of the maturity stages IV (small fungal spine stage), V (mid-fungal spine stage) and VI (mature), were prepared using the gradient ethanol precipitation method. The polysaccharide fraction HP4A isolated from the maturating-stage (stage IV) fruiting body had a significant difference from the fractions HP5A (stage V) and HP6A (stage VI) in the molecular weight distribution and monosaccharide compositions. Immunostimulating tests revealed that the polysaccharide fraction HP6 isolated from the mature stage (stage VI) fruiting body presented higher macrophage activation activity. Our findings provided important information for the harvest and use of H. erinaceus with higher qualities and functional benefits.


Title #899: Enhanced Production of Polysaccharide Through the Overexpression of Homologous Uridine Diphosphate Glucose Pyrophosphorylase Gene in a Submerged Culture of Lingzhi or Reishi Medicinal Mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum (Higher Basidiomycetes).
PMID: 26082982
Authors: Sen-Lin SL. Ji, Rui R. Liu, Meng-Fei MF. Ren, Huan-Jun HJ. Li, Jun-Wei JW. Xu
Abstract: This study aimed to improve polysaccharide production by engineering the biosynthetic pathway in Ganoderma lucidum through the overexpression of the homologous UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP) gene. The effects of UGP gene overexpression on intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) content, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, and transcription levels of 3 genes encoding the enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, including phosphoglucomutase (PGM), UGP, and Î±-1,3-glucan synthase (GLS), were investigated. The maximum IPS content and EPS production in G. lucidum overexpressing the UGP gene were 24.32 mg/100 mg dry weight and 1.66 g/L, respectively, which were higher by 42% and 36% than those of the wild-type strain. The transcription levels of PGM, UGP, and GLS were up-regulated by 1.6, 2.6, and 2.4-fold, respectively, in the engineered strain, suggesting that increased polysaccharide biosynthesis may result from a higher expression of those genes.


Title #900: Isolation and Characterization of Lectins Formed by Cerrena unicolor (Higher Basidiomycetes) in Solid-State Fermentation of Sorghum and Wheat Straw.
PMID: 26082981
Authors: Elene E. Davitashvili, Ekaterine E. Kapanadze, Eva E. Kachlishvili, Nona A NA. Mikiashvili, Vladimir V. Elisashvili
Abstract: The capability of Cerrena unicolor to produce fruiting bodies and lectins was studied in solid-state fermentation of a sorghum and wheat straw mixture. The first primordia appeared on day 48 and reached 6-10 mm; however, no formation of fruiting bodies occurred and these rudiments were harvested on day 55. The protein content in the rudiment extracts was significantly higher, whereas the specific hemagglutinating activity (HA) was sixfold lower as compared with those in extracts from mycelial biomass. Moreover, the specific HA of the 80-day mycelium increased to 16,667 U/mg, exceeding by sixfold that of 55-day-old mycelium. Four protein fractions (160, 105, 67, and 8 kDa) were detected by gel-chromatography of mycelial biomass crude extract; the highest specific HA was revealed in fraction III (26336 U HA/mg). Among sugars tested, galactose was the most potent inhibitor of HA of all protein fractions, with minimal inhibition concentrations of 0.095-0.780 mM. The galactose-specific lectins isolated from the fractions II and III by affinity chromatography ranged from 15 to 116 kDa and differed with kinetic parameters.


Title #901: Specificity of the Immunomodulating Activity of Sasa veitchii (Japanese Folk Medicine Kumazasa) to Fungal Polysaccharides.

Abstract: Many plant extracts are used as well-known folk medicines and exhibit various biological activities that are beneficial to human health. These extracts contain polysaccharides, and some are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that stimulate innate as well as acquired immune systems. In the present study, the cooperative effects of PAMPs and bamboo water-soluble methanol precipitation (BWMP) in a macromolecular fraction of the hot water extract of Sasa veitchii (in Japanese folk medicine, known as Kumazasa; family Poaceae) were analyzed in vitro using the spleen or bone marrow cells of mice. The splenocytes of male DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice were cultured with BWMP in the presence or absence of PAMPs, and responses were assessed by measuring cytokines. BWMP inhibited the production of interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) by not only toll like receptors (TLRs), but also the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) dectin-1 and dectin-2. BWMP also inhibited the autologous production of IFN-Î³ in the splenocyte culture. These results suggested that BWMP may inhibit the signaling pathways of PAMPs, but not ligand-receptor interactions. In contrast, BWMP did not inhibit the production of cytokines by dendritic cells. These results indicated that the inhibition of IFN-Î³ by BWMP was mediated through the cell-to-cell interactions of splenic cells during cultivation.

Title #903: Unplanned Readmissions After Hospitalization for Severe Sepsis at Academic Medical Center-Affiliated Hospitals.
PMID: 26082977
Authors: John P JP. Donnelly, Samuel F SF. Hohmann, Henry E HE. Wang
Abstract: In the United States, national efforts to reduce hospital readmissions have been enacted, including the application of substantial insurance reimbursement penalties for hospitals with elevated rates. Readmissions after severe sepsis remain understudied and could possibly signify lapses in care and missed opportunities for intervention. We sought to characterize 7- and 30-day readmission rates following hospital admission for severe sepsis as well as institutional variations in readmission.


Title #904: Strong Carbon Nanotube Fibers by Drawing Inspiration From Polymer Fiber Spinning.
PMID: 26082976
Authors: Belen B. Aleman, Victor V. Reguero, Bartolome B. Mas, Juan J JJ. Vilatela
Abstract: We present a method to spin highly oriented continuous fibers of adjustable carbon nanotube (CNT) type, with mechanical properties in the high-performance range. By lowering the concentration of nanotubes in the gas phase, through either reduction of the precursor feed rate or increase in carrier gas flow rate, the density of entanglements is reduced and the CNT aerogel can thus be drawn (up to 18 draw ratio) and wound at fast rates (>50m/min). This is achieved without affecting the synthesis process, as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, and implies that the parameters controlling composition in terms of CNT diameter and number of layers, are decoupled from those fixing CNT orientation. Applying polymer fiber wet-spinning principles then, strong CNT fibers (1GPa/SG) are produced under dilute conditions and high draw ratios, corresponding to highly aligned fibers (from wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering). This is demonstrated for fibers either made up of predominantly single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs), or predominantly multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs), which surprisingly have very similar tensile properties. Finally, we show that post-spin densification has no substantial effect on either alignment or properties (mechanical and electrical). These results demonstrate a route to control CNT assembly and reinforce their potential as a high-performance fiber.


Title #905: Assessment of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Interactions Between Albumin-Fused Mutated Butyrylcholinesterase and Intravenously Administered Cocaine in Recreational Cocaine Users.
PMID: 26082975

Abstract: Cocaine dependence presents a major public health issue, and to date, no pharmacotherapies are approved for its treatment. TV-1380 is a novel recombinant albumin-fused mutated butyrylcholinesterase (Albu-BChE) that has increased catalytic efficiency for cocaine compared with wild-type BChE and therefore has the potential to facilitate abstinence in cocaine-dependent subjects by decreasing exposure to cocaine and its reinforcing effects.

Abstract: Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment refractory people with schizophrenia, yet many patients only partially respond. Accumulating preclinical and clinical data suggest benefits with minocycline. We tested adjunct minocycline to clozapine in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Primary outcomes tested were positive, and cognitive symptoms, while avolition, anxiety/depression, and negative symptoms were secondary outcomes.

Title #909: C-(2-Deoxy-d-arabino-hex-1-enopyranosyl)-oxadiazoles: synthesis of possible isomers and their evaluation as glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors.
PMID: 26082971
Authors: Ãva Ã. Bokor, Eszter E. Szennyes, Tibor T. CsupÃ¡sz, NÃ³ra N. TÃ³th, Tibor T. Docsa, PÃ¡l P. Gergely, LÃ¡szlÃ³ L. SomsÃ¡k
Abstract: Synthetic methods were elaborated for d-glucals attached to oxadiazoles by a C-C bond. Introduction of the double bond was effected by either DBU induced elimination of PhCOOH from the O-perbenzoylated glucopyranosyl precursors or Zn/N-methylimidazole mediated reductive elimination from the 1-bromoglucopyranosyl starting compounds. Alternatively, heterocyclizations of 2-deoxy-d-arabino-hex-1-enopyranosyl cyanide were also carried out. Test compounds were obtained by ZemplÃ©n debenzoylation, however, none of them showed significant inhibition of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b.


Title #910: Photoredox-Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Imines with Visible Light.
PMID: 26082970
Authors: Masaki M. Nakajima, Eleonora E. Fava, Sebastian S. Loescher, Zhen Z. Jiang, Magnus M. Rueping
Abstract: Ketyl radical and amino radical anions, valuable reactive intermediates for Cï£¿C bond-forming reactions, are accessible through a Cï£¾O/Cï£¾NR umpolung. However, their utilization in catalysis remains largely underdeveloped owing to the high reduction potential of carbonyl compounds and imines. In the context of photoredox catalysis, tertiary amines are commonly employed as sacrificial co-reducing agents. Herein, an additional role of the amine is proposed, in which it is essential for the organocatalytic substrate activation. The combination of photoredox catalysis and carbonyl/imine activation enables the reductive coupling of aldehydes, ketones, and imines under mild reaction conditions.


Title #911: Metal-based antibacterial substrates for biomedical applications.
PMID: 26082968
Authors: Federica F. Paladini, Mauro M. Pollini, Alessandro A. Sannino, Luigi L. Ambrosio
Abstract: The interest in nanotechnology and the growing concern for the antibiotic resistance demonstrated by many microorganisms have recently stimulated many efforts in designing innovative biomaterials and substrates with antibacterial properties. Among the implemented strategies to control the incidence of infections associated to the use of biomedical device and implants, interesting routes are represented by the incorporation of bactericidal agents onto the surface of biomaterials for the prevention of bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. Natural products and particularly bioactive metals such as silver, copper and zinc represent an interesting alternative for the development of advanced biomaterials with antimicrobial properties. This review presents an overview of recent progress in the modification of biomaterials as well as the most attractive techniques for the deposition of antimicrobial coatings on different substrates for biomedical application. Moreover, some research activities and results achieved by the authors in the development of antibacterial materials are also presented and discussed.

Title #913: 'It Gives Me My Freedom': Technology and Responding to Bodily Limitations in Motor Neuron Disease.
PMID: 26082966
Authors: Amanda A. Pavey, Narelle N. Warren, Jacquelyn J. Allen-Collinson
Abstract: People living with Motor Neuron Disease (MND) experience profound and rapidly progressing impairment. In order to maintain their physical and social functioning, people so affected employ a range of technologies and technological aids (body auxiliaries) to enhance their life and maintain wellbeing. Using a phenomenological study design, we explored the experiences of 42 men and women who had been diagnosed with MND. Although many participants initially resisted the adoption of aids (often-electronic devices that enabled continued participation in daily life) or tools (the instruments that allowed achievement of specific tasks), such technologies offered a way for people with MND to overcome, to some extent, the limitations posed by their physical degeneration. Through generating a sense of 'normality', these kinds of 'enabling' technologies promoted social engagement and the maintenance of valued relationships or activities. Technologies can provide people with MND with some positive experiences within a way of being-in-the-world that has become so difficult and challenging.


Title #914: Stress-structure relation in dense colloidal melts under forward and instantaneous reversal of the shear.
PMID: 26082951
Authors: Amit Kumar AK. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: A dense supercooled colloidal melt in forward shear from a quiescent state shows overshoot in the shear stress at 10% strain with an unchanged fluid structure at equal stress before and after overshoot. In addition, we find an overshoot in the normal stress with a monotonic increase in the osmotic pressure at an identical strain. The first and second normal stresses become comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign. A functional dependence of the steady state stress and osmotic pressure with the PÃ©clet number demonstrates the signature of crossover between Newtonian and nearly-Newtonian regimes. Moreover, instantaneous shear reversal from a steady state exhibiting the Bauschinger effect, where a strong history dependence is observed depending on the time of the flow reversal. The distribution of the particulate stress and osmotic pressure at the point of the flow reversal is shown to be a signature of the subsequent response. We link the history dependence of the stress-strain curves to changes in the fluid structure measured through the angular components of the radial distribution function. A uniform compression in the transition from forward to reversed flowing states is found.


Title #915: Humidity-dependent compression-induced glass transition of the air-water interfacial Langmuir films of poly(d,l-lactic acid-ran-glycolic acid) (PLGA).
PMID: 26082950
Authors: Hyun Chang HC. Kim, Hoyoung H. Lee, Hyunjung H. Jung, Yun Hwa YH. Choi, Mati M. Meron, Binhua B. Lin, Joona J. Bang, You-Yeon YY. Won
Abstract: Constant rate compression isotherms of the air-water interfacial Langmuir films of poly(d,l-lactic acid-ran-glycolic acid) (PLGA) show a distinct feature of an exponential increase in surface pressure in the high surface polymer concentration regime. We have previously demonstrated that this abrupt increase in surface pressure is linked to the glass transition of the polymer film, but the detailed mechanism of this process is not fully understood. In order to obtain a molecular-level understanding of this behavior, we performed extensive characterizations of the surface mechanical, structural and rheological properties of Langmuir PLGA films at the air-water interface, using combined experimental techniques including the Langmuir film balance, X-ray reflectivity and double-wall-ring interfacial rheometry methods. We observed that the mechanical and structural responses of the Langmuir PLGA films are significantly dependent on the rate of film compression; the glass transition was induced in the PLGA film only at fast compression rates. Surprisingly, we found that this deformation rate dependence is also dependent on the humidity of the environment. With water acting as a plasticizer for the PLGA material, the diffusion of water molecules through the PLGA film seems to be the key factor in the determination of the glass transformation properties and thus the mechanical response of the PLGA film against lateral compression. Based on our combined results, we hypothesize the following mechanism for the compression-induced glass transformation of the Langmuir PLGA film; (1) initially, a humidified/non-glassy PLGA film is formed in the full surface-coverage region (where the surface pressure shows a plateau) during compression; (2) further compression leads to the collapse of the PLGA chains and the formation of new surfaces on the air side of the film, and this newly formed top layer of the PLGA film is transiently glassy in character because the water evaporation rate in the top surface region is momentarily faster than the humidification rate (due to the initial roughness of the newly formed surface); (3) after some time, the top layer itself becomes humidified through diffusion of water from the subphase, and thus it becomes non-glassy, leading to the relaxation of the applied compressive stress.

Title #917: Macrophage polarization in kidney diseases.
PMID: 26082946
Authors: Shaojiang S. Tian, Shi-You SY. Chen
Abstract: Macrophage accumulation associates closely with the degree of renal structural injury and renal dysfunction in human kidney diseases. Depletion of macrophages reduces while adoptive transfer of macrophages worsens inflammation in animal models of the renal injury. However, emerging evidence support that macrophage polarization plays a critical role in the progression of a number of kidney diseases including obstructive nephropathy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and other kidney diseases. In this mini-review, we briefly summarize the macrophage infiltration and polarization in these inflammatory and fibrotic kidney diseases, discussing the results mostly from studies in animal models. In view of the critical role of macrophage in the progression of these diseases, manipulating macrophage phenotype may be a potential effective strategy to treat various kidney diseases.


Title #918: Role of T Follicular Helper cells in Multiple Sclerosis.
PMID: 26082945
Authors: Nathalie N. Schmitt
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease which results from the destruction of myelin and associated collateral tissue damage within the central nervous system (CNS). MS is a highly diverse disease with different clinical profiles. During the past decade, several new treatment options have been introduced, but no treatment completely stops the disease progression. Therefore deeper understanding of the disease mechanism is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies. While yet to be proven, there is evidence suggesting the involvement of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a CD4 T cell subset specialized for the provision of help to B cells, in the pathogenesis of MS. In this review, I will discuss the potential pathogenic roles of Tfh cells in the course of MS.


Title #919: Bi-phasic expression of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) during breast cancer progression: Potential roles of HP1 and chromatin structure in tumorigenesis.
PMID: 26082944
Authors: Young-Ho YH. Lee, David K DK. Ann
Abstract: Epigenetics in cancer prognosis and therapy is gaining recognition in recent years. Breast cancer is a genetic disease harboring numerous genetic mutations, including tumor suppressor BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. However, the functions of BRCA1 in cancer cells are also altered by non-genetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and chromatin structure. Therefore, identification of epigenetic markers for breast cancer is very important for early diagnosis and effective therapy. This review focuses on recent findings on the roles of Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) in BRCA1 functions and breast cancer progression. We previously showed that BRCA1 function and breast cancer progression are frequently associated with HP1 expression level and potentially with chromatin structure. Herein, we suggest that bi-phasic expression of HP1 during breast cancer progression indicates dual roles of HP1 in tumorigenesis. Exploiting differential HP1 expression in tumors could lead to effective cancer therapy. Re-setting the chromatin structure may be a critical step for high-efficiency cancer therapy for many breast cancer patients.


Title #920: Encoding Hydrogel Mechanics via Network Cross-Linking Structure.
PMID: 26082943
Authors: Ryan M RM. Schweller, Jennifer L JL. West
Abstract: The effects of mechanical cues on cell behaviors in 3D remain difficult to characterize as the ability to tune hydrogel mechanics often requires changes in the polymer density, potentially altering the material's biochemical and physical characteristics. Additionally, with most PEG diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels, forming materials with compressive moduli less than â¼10 kPa has been virtually impossible. Here, we present a new method of controlling the mechanical properties of PEGDA hydrogels independent of polymer chain density through the incorporation of additional vinyl group moieties that interfere with the cross-linking of the network. This modification can tune hydrogel mechanics in a concentration dependent manner from <1 to 17 kPa, a more physiologically relevant range than previously possible with PEG-based hydrogels, without altering the hydrogel's degradation and permeability. Across this range of mechanical properties, endothelial cells (ECs) encapsulated within MMP-2/MMP-9 degradable hydrogels with RGDS adhesive peptides revealed increased cell spreading as hydrogel stiffness decreased in contrast to behavior typically observed for cells on 2D surfaces. EC-pericyte cocultures exhibited vessel-like networks within 3 days in highly compliant hydrogels as compared to a week in stiffer hydrogels. These vessel networks persisted for at least 4 weeks and deposited laminin and collagen IV perivascularly. These results indicate that EC morphogenesis can be regulated using mechanical cues in 3D. Furthermore, controlling hydrogel compliance independent of density allows for the attainment of highly compliant mechanical regimes in materials that can act as customizable cell microenvironments.


Title #921: Measurement of Retinal Blood Flow Using Fluorescently Labeled Red Blood Cells.
PMID: 26082942
Authors: Tess E TE. Kornfield, Eric A EA. Newman
Abstract: Blood flow is a useful indicator of the metabolic state of the retina. However, accurate measurement of retinal blood flow is difficult to achieve in practice. Most existing optical techniques used for measuring blood flow require complex assumptions and calculations. We describe here a simple and direct method for calculating absolute blood flow in vessels of all sizes in the rat retina. The method relies on ultrafast confocal line scans to track the passage of fluorescently labeled red blood cells (fRBCs). The accuracy of the blood flow measurements was verified by (1) comparing blood flow calculated independently using either flux or velocity combined with diameter measurements, (2) measuring total retinal blood flow in arterioles and venules, (3) measuring blood flow at vessel branch points, and (4) measuring changes in blood flow in response to hyperoxic and hypercapnic challenge. Confocal line scans oriented parallel and diagonal to vessels were used to compute fRBC velocity and to examine velocity profiles across the width of vessels. We demonstrate that these methods provide accurate measures of absolute blood flow and velocity in retinal vessels of all sizes.


Title #922: Twitter: A Novel Tool for Studying the Health and Social Needs of Transgender Communities.
PMID: 26082941
Authors: Evan A EA. Krueger, Sean D SD. Young
Abstract: Limited research has examined the health and social needs of transgender and gender nonconforming populations. Due to high levels of stigma, transgender individuals may avoid disclosing their identities to researchers, hindering this type of work. Further, researchers have traditionally relied on clinic-based sampling methods, which may mask the true heterogeneity of transgender and gender nonconforming communities. Online social networking websites present a novel platform for studying this diverse, difficult-to-reach population.

Title #928: Secrets and Misperceptions: The Creation of Self-Fulfilling Illusions.
PMID: 26082932
Authors: Sarah K SK. Cowan
Abstract: This study examines who hears what secrets, comparing two similar secrets-one that is highly stigmatized and one that is less so. Using a unique survey representative of American adults and intake forms from a medical clinic, I document marked differences in who hears these secrets. People who are sympathetic to the stigmatizing secret are more likely to hear of it than those who may react negatively. This is a consequence of people not just selectively disclosing their own secrets but selectively sharing others' as well. As a result, people in the same social network will be exposed to and influenced by different information about those they know and hence experience that network differently. When people effectively exist in networks tailored by others not to offend, then the information they hear tends to be that of which they already approve. Were they to hear secrets they disapproved of, then their attitudes might change, but they are less likely to hear those secrets. As such, the patterns of secret hearing contribute to a stasis in public opinion.


Title #929: Route to genetically targeted optical electrophysiology: development and applications of voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins.
PMID: 26082930
Authors: Walther W. Akemann, Chenchen C. Song, Hiroki H. Mutoh, Thomas T. KnÃ¶pfel
Abstract: The invention of membrane voltage protein indicators widens the reach of optical voltage imaging in cell physiology, most notably neurophysiology, by enabling membrane voltage recordings from genetically defined cell types in chronic and life-long preparations. While the last years have seen a dramatic improvement in the technical performance of these indicators, concomitant innovations in optogenetics, optical axon tracing, and high-speed digital microscopy are beginning to fulfill the age-old vision of an all-optical analysis of neuronal circuits, reaching beyond the limits of traditional electrode-based recordings. We will present our personal account of the development of protein voltage indicators from the pioneering days to the present state, including their applications in neurophysiology that has inspired our own work for more than a decade.


Title #930: Recent Development in Pulmonary Valve Replacement after Tetralogy of Fallot Repair: The Emergence of Hybrid Approaches.
PMID: 26082929
Authors: Tariq T. Suleiman, Clifford J CJ. Kavinsky, Clare C. Skerritt, Damien D. Kenny, Michael N MN. Ilbawi, Massimo M. Caputo
Abstract: An increasing number of patients with tetralogy of Fallot require repeat surgical intervention for pulmonary valve replacement secondary to pulmonary regurgitation. Catheter-based interventions have emerged as an attractive alternative to surgery in this patient population but it is limited by patient size or the anatomy of the right ventricular outflow tract. Hybrid approaches involving both cardiac interventionists and surgeons are being developed to overcome these limitations. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in the hybrid field of pulmonary valve replacement, summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of the "traditional" surgical and the new catheter-based techniques and discuss the direction future research should take to determine the optimal management for individual patients.

Title #932: Bioattribution Needs a Coherent International Approach to Improve Global Biosecurity.
PMID: 26082927
Authors: Randall Steven RS. Murch
Abstract: The forensic investigation of hoax, suspected or actual biological weapons attacks, and bioproliferation activities is recognized by biosecurity-advanced nations as an important pillar in a national biosecurity program. Some nations have taken this seriously; most others have not or are not aware of the potential. When law enforcement and forensic science investigations are performed in a coordinated manner, decisions assigning attribution are informed and accountability is supported through legal and policy decisions and actions. Incorporating public health investigative and tailored scientific assets makes the system even more effective, dynamic, and robust. Perpetrators and enablers must be held at risk of being brought to justice, or through a policy decision resulting in direct action being taken or sanctions imposed. This paper provides a foundation and path forward to establish substantially expanded capability founded on establishing and leveraging national and regional programs and international agreement that attribution is an important component of biosecurity. Specific forward-looking initiatives will be recommended and discussed.


Title #933: Strategies to Stimulate Mobilization and Homing of Endogenous Stem and Progenitor Cells for Bone Tissue Repair.
PMID: 26082926
Authors: Marietta M. Herrmann, Sophie S. Verrier, Mauro M. Alini
Abstract: The gold standard for the treatment of critical-size bone defects is autologous or allogenic bone graft. This has several limitations including donor site morbidity and the restricted supply of graft material. Cell-based tissue engineering strategies represent an alternative approach. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered as a source of osteoprogenitor cells. More recently, focus has been placed on the use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), since vascularization is a critical step in bone healing. Although many of these approaches have demonstrated effectiveness for bone regeneration, cell-based therapies require time consuming and cost-expensive in vitro cell expansion procedures. Accordingly, research is becoming increasingly focused on the homing and stimulation of native cells. The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) - CXCR4 axis has been shown to be critical for the recruitment of MSCs and EPCs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key factor in angiogenesis and has been targeted in many studies. Here, we present an overview of the different approaches for delivering homing factors to the defect site by absorption or incorporation to biomaterials, gene therapy, or via genetically manipulated cells. We further review strategies focusing on the stimulation of endogenous cells to support bone repair. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in the treatment of critical-size bone defects and fracture non-unions.


Title #934: Biochemical and Structural Characterization of Enolase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus: Evidence for a Thermophilic Origin.
PMID: 26082925
Authors: Oleg A OA. Zadvornyy, Eric S ES. Boyd, Matthew C MC. Posewitz, Nikolay A NA. Zorin, John W JW. Peters
Abstract: Enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate during both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and is required by all three domains of life. Here, we report the purification and biochemical and structural characterization of enolase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus, a thermophilic anoxygenic phototroph affiliated with the green non-sulfur bacteria. The protein was purified as a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 46âkDa. The temperature optimum for enolase catalysis was 80Â°C, close to the measured thermal stability of the protein which was determined to be 75Â°C, while the pH optimum for enzyme activity was 6.5. The specific activities of purified enolase determined at 25 and 80Â°C were 147 and 300âUâmg(-1) of protein, respectively. K m values for the 2-phosphoglycerate/phosphoenolpyruvate reaction determined at 25 and 80Â°C were 0.16 and 0.03âmM, respectively. The K m values for Mg(2+) binding at these temperatures were 2.5 and 1.9âmM, respectively. When compared to enolase from mesophiles, the biochemical and structural properties of enolase from C. aurantiacus are consistent with this being thermally adapted. These data are consistent with the results of our phylogenetic analysis of enolase, which reveal that enolase has a thermophilic origin.


Title #935: Water-Permeable Dialysis Membranes for Multi-Layered Microdialysis System.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of water-permeable dialysis membranes that are suitable for an implantable microdialysis system that does not use dialysis fluid. We developed a microdialysis system integrating microfluidic channels and nanoporous filtering membranes made of polyethersulfone (PES), aiming at a fully implantable system that drastically improves the quality of life of patients. Simplicity of the total system is crucial for the implantable dialysis system, where the pumps and storage tanks for the dialysis fluid pose problems. Hence, we focus on hemofiltration, which does not require the dialysis fluid but water-permeable membranes. We investigated the water permeability of the PES membrane with respect to the concentrations of the PES, the additives, and the solvents in the casting solution. Sufficiently, water-permeable membranes were found through in vitro experiments using whole bovine blood. The filtrate was verified to have the concentrations of low-molecular-weight molecules, such as sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine, while proteins, such as albumin, were successfully blocked by the membrane. We conducted in vivo experiments using rats, where the system was connected to the femoral artery and jugular vein. The filtrate was successfully collected without any leakage of blood inside the system and it did not contain albumin but low-molecular-weight molecules whose concentrations were identical to those of the blood. The rat model with renal failure showed 100% increase of creatinine in 5âh, while rats connected to the system showed only a 7.4% increase, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed microdialysis system.


Title #936: Stress-induced DNA damage biomarkers: applications and limitations.
PMID: 26082923
Authors: Zacharenia Z. Nikitaki, Christine E CE. Hellweg, Alexandros G AG. Georgakilas, Jean-Luc JL. Ravanat
Abstract: A variety of environmental stresses like chemicals, UV and ionizing radiation and organism's endogenous processes such as replication stress and metabolism can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) that can attack cellular vital components like DNA, proteins and lipid membranes. Among them, much attention has been focused on DNA since DNA damage plays a role in several biological disorders and aging processes. Thus, DNA damage can be used as a biomarker in a reliable and accurate way to quantify for example radiation exposure and can indicate its possible long term effects and cancer risk. Based on the type of DNA lesions detected one can hypothesize on the most probable mechanisms involved in the formation of these lesions for example in the case of UV and ionizing radiation (e.g., X- or Î±-, Î³-rays, energetic ions, neutrons). In this review we describe the most accepted chemical pathways for DNA damage induction and the different types of DNA lesions, i.e., single, complex DNA lesions etc. that can be used as DNA damage biomarkers. We critically compare DNA damage detection methods and their limitations. In addition, we suggest the use of DNA repair gene products as biomarkes for identification of different types of stresses i.e., radiation, oxidative, or replication stress, based on bioinformatic approaches and meta-analysis of literature data.

Title #938: Short- and Long-Term Effectiveness of a Subject's Specific Novel Brain and Vestibular Rehabilitation Treatment Modality in Combat Veterans Suffering from PTSD.
PMID: 26082920
Authors: Frederick Robert FR. Carrick, Guido G. Pagnacco, Kate K. McLellan, Ross R. Solis, Jacob J. Shores, Andre A. Fredieu, Joel Brandon JB. Brock, Cagan C. Randall, Cameron C. Wright, Elena E. Oggero
Abstract: Treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans that have a long-term positive clinical effect has the potential to modify the treatment of PTSD. This outcome may result in changed and saved lives of our service personnel and their families. In a previous before-after-intervention study, we demonstrated high statistical and substantively significant short-term changes in the Clinician Administered DSM-IV PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores after a 2-week trial of a subject's particular novel brain and vestibular rehabilitation (VR) program. The long-term maintenance of PTSD severity reduction was the subject of this study.


Title #939: Assessment of Immature Platelet Fraction in the Diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.
PMID: 26082919
Authors: Robert R. Sokolic, Neal N. Oden, Fabio F. Candotti
Abstract: Children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are often first diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), potentially leading to both inappropriate treatment and the delay of life-saving definitive therapy. WAS is traditionally differentiated from ITP based on the small size of WAS platelets. In practice, microthrombocytopenia is often not present or not appreciated in children with WAS. To develop an alternative method of differentiating WAS from ITP, we retrospectively reviewed all complete blood counts and measurements of immature platelet fraction (IPF) in 18 subjects with WAS and 38 subjects with a diagnosis of ITP treated at our hospital. Examination of peripheral blood smears revealed a wide range of platelet sizes in subjects with WAS. Mean platelet volume (MPV) was not reported in 26% of subjects, and subjects in whom MPV was not reported had lower platelet counts than did subjects in whom MPV was reported. Subjects with WAS had a lower IPF than would be expected for their level of thrombocytopenia, and the IPF in subjects with WAS was significantly lower than in subjects with a diagnosis of ITP. Using logistic regression, we developed and validated a rule based on platelet count and IPF that was more sensitive for the diagnosis of WAS than was the MPV, and was applicable regardless of the level of platelets or the availability of the MPV. Our observations demonstrate that MPV is often not available in severely thrombocytopenic subjects, which may hinder the diagnosis of WAS. In addition, subjects with WAS have a low IPF, which is consistent with the notion that a platelet production defect contributes to the thrombocytopenia of WAS. Knowledge of this detail of WAS pathophysiology allows to differentiate WAS from ITP with increased sensitivity, thereby allowing a physician to spare children with WAS from inappropriate treatment, and make definitive therapy available in a timely manner.


Title #940: A First Case of Osteomesopyknosis in Korea.
PMID: 26082918
Authors: Bi-Na BN. Jeoung, Jong-Min JM. Kim, Gyoun-Eun GE. Kang, Jang-Hwan JH. Lim, Eui-Hyun EH. Kim, Hyun-Ae HA. Seo
Abstract: Osteomesopyknosis is a rare sclerosing bone disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance. We report a first case of osteomesopyknosis in Korea. A 16-year old girl complained of diffuse back pain for 1 year. We performed physical examination, biochemical investigations and imaging studies. A radiograph of spine revealed rugger-jersey vertebra and sandwich vertebra. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen were normal. Only an axial skeleton involvement was shown on the whole body bone scan. This patient was diagnosed to have osteomesopyknosis. Osteomesopyknosis is characterized by normal level of bone turnover marker and an axial bone involvement. Osteomesopyknosis can be occurred in Korea and needs to be considered when patients, especially young patients, suffer from back pain and have only axial osteosclerosis.

Title #947: Toothbrush: A Report of an Unusual Foreign Body.
PMID: 26082909
Authors: Mohammad Reza MR. Farahnak, Somayeh S. Araghi, Soheila S. Nikakhlagh, Nader N. Saki
Abstract: Ingestion of a foreign body is a common problem among all age groups. Most of the foreign bodies in the pharynx are usually lodged at the level of cricopharynx. The diagnosis is based on history, clinical, and radiological examination. Most foreign-body ingestions are accidental, but there may be contributory factors such as mental disorder, alcoholism, and prison incarceration. Toothbrush ingestion is uncommon and requires prompt medical attention.

The main aim of treatment is to start the patient on an antitubercular regime and early surgical intervention to decompress the facial nerve if involved.


Title #951: Epidemiological Survey of Sinonasal Malignancy in North-East Iran.
PMID: 26082905
Authors: Mehdi M. Poursadegh, Farid F. Poursadegh, Majid M. Esmaeili, Mehdi M. Bakhshaee
Abstract: SinonasalÂ malignanciesÂ are uncommonÂ neoplasmsÂ with several histological subtypes. These malignancies have a poor prognosis and, because of the nonspecific nature of the symptoms, most patients are diagnosed late when the disease is already at an advanced stage. Therefore, most sinonasal malignancies tend to be treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Understanding the incidence and prevalence of clinical symptoms, pathology, diagnosis, and subsequent prognosis of the disease is important for early diagnosis.

Title #959: Autophagy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV infections.
PMID: 26082897
Authors: Lucile L. Espert, Bruno B. Beaumelle, Isabelle I. Vergne
Abstract: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) are among the most lethal human pathogens worldwide, each being responsible for around 1.5 million deaths annually. Moreover, synergy between acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) has turned HIV/M.tb co-infection into a major public health threat in developing countries. In the past decade, autophagy, a lysosomal catabolic process, has emerged as a major host immune defense mechanism against infectious agents like M.tb and HIV. Nevertheless, in some instances, autophagy machinery appears to be instrumental for HIV infection. Finally, there is mounting evidence that both pathogens deploy various countermeasures to thwart autophagy. This mini-review proposes an overview of the roles and regulations of autophagy in HIV and M.tb infections with an emphasis on microbial factors. We also discuss the role of autophagy manipulation in the context of HIV/M.tb co-infection. In future, a comprehensive understanding of autophagy interaction with these pathogens will be critical for development of autophagy-based prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for AIDS and TB.


Title #960: Purification and proteomics of pathogen-modified vacuoles and membranes.

Abstract: Certain pathogenic bacteria adopt an intracellular lifestyle and proliferate in eukaryotic host cells. The intracellular niche protects the bacteria from cellular and humoral components of the mammalian immune system, and at the same time, allows the bacteria to gain access to otherwise restricted nutrient sources. Yet, intracellular protection and access to nutrients comes with a price, i.e., the bacteria need to overcome cell-autonomous defense mechanisms, such as the bactericidal endocytic pathway. While a few bacteria rupture the early phagosome and escape into the host cytoplasm, most intracellular pathogens form a distinct, degradation-resistant and replication-permissive membranous compartment. Intracellular bacteria that form unique pathogen vacuoles include Legionella, Mycobacterium, Chlamydia, Simkania, and Salmonella species. In order to understand the formation of these pathogen niches on a global scale and in a comprehensive and quantitative manner, an inventory of compartment-associated host factors is required. To this end, the intact pathogen compartments need to be isolated, purified and biochemically characterized. Here, we review recent progress on the isolation and purification of pathogen-modified vacuoles and membranes, as well as their proteomic characterization by mass spectrometry and different validation approaches. These studies provide the basis for further investigations on the specific mechanisms of pathogen-driven compartment formation.

Title #963: Inhibitory behavioral control: A stochastic dynamic causal modeling study comparing cocaine dependent subjects and controls.
PMID: 26082893

Abstract: Cocaine dependence is associated with increased impulsivity in humans. Both cocaine dependence and impulsive behavior are under the regulatory control of cortico-striatal networks. One behavioral laboratory measure of impulsivity is response inhibition (ability to withhold a prepotent response) in which altered patterns of regional brain activation during executive tasks in service of normal performance are frequently found in cocaine dependent (CD) subjects studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, little is known about aberrations in specific directional neuronal connectivity in CD subjects. The present study employed fMRI-based dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to study the effective (directional) neuronal connectivity associated with response inhibition in CD subjects, elicited under performance of a Go/NoGo task with two levels of NoGo difficulty (Easy and Hard). The performance on the Go/NoGo task was not significantly different between CD subjects and controls. The DCM analysis revealed that prefrontal-striatal connectivity was modulated (influenced) during the NoGo conditions for both groups. The effective connectivity from left (L) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to L caudate was similarly modulated during the Easy NoGo condition for both groups. During the Hard NoGo condition in controls, the effective connectivity from right (R) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to L caudate became more positive, and the effective connectivity from R ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) to L caudate became more negative. In CD subjects, the effective connectivity from L ACC to L caudate became more negative during the Hard NoGo conditions. These results indicate that during Hard NoGo trials in CD subjects, the ACC rather than DLPFC or VLPFC influenced caudate during response inhibition.


Title #964: Morphological differences in the lateral geniculate nucleus associated with dyslexia.
PMID: 26082892
Authors: MÃ³nica M. Giraldo-Chica, John P JP. Hegarty, Keith A KA. Schneider
Abstract: Developmental dyslexia is a common learning disability characterized by normal intelligence but difficulty in skills associated with reading, writing and spelling. One of the most prominent, albeit controversial, theories of dyslexia is the magnocellular theory, which suggests that malfunction of the magnocellular system in the brain is responsible for the behavioral deficits. We sought to test the basis of this theory by directly measuring the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the only location in the brain where the magnocellular and parvocellular streams are spatially disjoint. Using high-resolution proton-density weighted MRI scans, we precisely measured the anatomical boundaries of the LGN in 13 subjects with dyslexia (five female) and 13 controls (three female), all 22-26Â years old. The left LGN was significantly smaller in volume in subjects with dyslexia and also differed in shape; no differences were observed in the right LGN. The functional significance of this asymmetry is unknown, but these results are consistent with the magnocellular theory and support theories of dyslexia that involve differences in the early visual system.

Abstract: Diffusion imaging tractography is increasingly used to trace critical fiber tracts in brain tumor patients to reduce the risk of post-operative neurological deficit. However, the effects of peritumoral edema pose a challenge to conventional tractography using the standard diffusion tensor model. The aim of this study was to present a novel technique using a two-tensor unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm to track the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in brain tumor patients with peritumoral edema.

Abstract: Effects of both domain-specific and broader cognitive remediation protocols have been reported for neural activity and overt performance in schizophrenia (SZ). Progress is limited by insufficient knowledge of relevant neural mechanisms. Addressing neuronal signal resolution in the auditory system as a mechanism contributing to cognitive function and dysfunction in schizophrenia, the present study compared effects of two neuroplasticity-based training protocols targeting auditory-verbal or facial affect discrimination accuracy and a standard rehabilitation protocol on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) oscillatory brain activity in an auditory paired-click task. SZ were randomly assigned to either 20 daily 1-hour sessions over 4Â weeks of auditory-verbal training (NÂ =Â 19), similarly intense facial affect discrimination training (NÂ =Â 19), or 4Â weeks of treatment as usual (TAU, NÂ =Â 19). Pre-training, the 57 SZ showed smaller click-induced posterior alpha power modulation than did 28 healthy comparison participants, replicating Popov et al. (2011b). Abnormally small alpha decrease 300-800Â ms around S2 improved more after targeted auditory-verbal training than after facial affect training or TAU. The improvement in oscillatory brain dynamics with training correlated with improvement on a measure of verbal learning. Results replicate previously reported effects of neuroplasticity-based psychological training on oscillatory correlates of auditory stimulus differentiation, encoding, and updating and indicate specificity of cortical training effects.


Title #968: Reversal of functional changes in the brain associated with obstructive sleep apnoea following 6Â months of CPAP.
PMID: 26082888
Authors: Rania H RH. Fatouleh, Linda C LC. Lundblad, Paul M PM. Macey, David K DK. McKenzie, Luke A LA. Henderson, Vaughan G VG. Macefield
Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with an increase in the number of bursts of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), leading to neurogenic hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective and widely used treatment for preventing collapse of the upper airway in OSA. In addition to improving sleep, CPAP decreases daytime MSNA towards control levels. It remains unknown how this restoration of MSNA occurs, in particular whether CPAP treatment results in a simple readjustment in activity of those brain regions responsible for the initial increase in MSNA or whether other brain regions are recruited to over-ride aberrant brain activity. By recording MSNA concurrently with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we aimed to assess brain activity associated with each individual subject's patterns of MSNA prior to and following 6Â months of CPAP treatment. Spontaneous fluctuations in MSNA were recorded via tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the common peroneal nerve in 13 newly diagnosed patients with OSA before and after 6Â months of treatment with CPAP and in 15 healthy control subjects while lying in a 3Â T MRI scanner. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast gradient echo, echo-planar images were continuously collected in a 4Â s ON, 4Â s OFF (200 volumes) sampling protocol. MSNA was significantly elevated in newly diagnosed OSA patients compared to control subjects (55Â Â±Â 4 vs 26Â Â±Â 2Â bursts/min). Fluctuations in BOLD signal intensity in multiple regions covaried with the intensity of the concurrently recorded bursts of MSNA. There was a significant fall in MSNA after 6Â months of CPAP (39Â Â±Â 2Â bursts/min). The reduction in resting MSNA was coupled with significant falls in signal intensity in precuneus bilaterally, the left and right insula, right medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate cortex, right parahippocampus and the left and right retrosplenial cortices. These data support our contention that functional changes in these suprabulbar sites are, via projections to the brainstem, driving the augmented sympathetic outflow to the muscle vascular bed in untreated OSA.

Abstract: Diagnosing corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is often difficult due to the wide variety of symptoms and overlaps in the similar clinical courses and neurological findings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of white matter (WM) atrophy for the diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed CBD (corticobasal syndrome, CBS) and PSP (Richardson's syndrome, RS).

Abstract: Children exposed to substantial amounts of alcohol in utero display a broad range of morphological and behavioral outcomes, which are collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Common to all children on the spectrum are cognitive and behavioral problems that reflect central nervous system dysfunction. Little is known, however, about the potential effects of variables such as sex on alcohol-induced brain damage. The goal of the current research was to utilize magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the effect of sex on brain dynamics in adolescents and young adults with FASD during the performance of an auditory oddball task. The stimuli were short trains of 1Â kHz "standard" tone bursts (80%) randomly interleaved with 1.5Â kHz "target" tone bursts (10%) and "novel" digital sounds (10%). Participants made motor responses to the target tones. Results are reported for 44 individuals (18 males and 26 females) ages 12 through 22Â years. Nine males and 13 females had a diagnosis of FASD and the remainder were typically-developing age- and sex-matched controls. The main finding was widespread sex-specific differential activation of the frontal, medial and temporal cortex in adolescents with FASD compared to typically developing controls. Significant differences in evoked-response and time-frequency measures of brain dynamics were observed for all stimulus types in the auditory cortex, inferior frontal sulcus and hippocampus. These results underscore the importance of considering the influence of sex when analyzing neurophysiological data in children with FASD.


Title #971: Substrate specificity of mitochondrial intermediate peptidase analysed by a support-bound peptide library.

Abstract: The substrate specificity of recombinant human mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (hMIP) using a synthetic support-bound FRET peptide library is presented. The collected fluorescent beads, which contained the hydrolysed peptides generated by hMIP, were sequenced by Edman degradation. The results showed that this peptidase presents a remarkable preference for polar uncharged residues at P1 and P1' substrate positions: SerÂ =Â GlnÂ >Â Thr at P1 and SerÂ >Â Thr at P1'. Non-polar residues were frequent at the substrate P3, P2, P2' and P3' positions. Analysis of the predicted MIP processing sites in imported mitochondrial matrix proteins shows these cleavages indeed occur between polar uncharged residues. Previous analysis of these processing sites indicated the importance of positions far from the MIP cleavage site, namely the presence of a hydrophobic residue (Phe or Leu) at P8 and a polar uncharged residue (Ser or Thr) at P5. To evaluate this, additional kinetic analyses were carried out, using fluorogenic substrates synthesized based on the processing sites attributed to MIP. The results described here underscore the importance of the P1 and P1' substrate positions for the hydrolytic activity of hMIP. The information presented in this work will help in the design of new substrate-based inhibitors for this peptidase.


Title #972: Nanotechnology for cancer treatment.
PMID: 26082884
Authors: William H WH. Gmeiner, Supratim S. Ghosh
Abstract: Nanotechnology has the potential to increase the selectivity and potency of chemical, physical, and biological approaches for eliciting cancer cell death while minimizing collateral toxicity to nonmalignant cells. Materials on the nanoscale are increasingly being targeted to cancer cells with great specificity through both active and passive targeting. In this review, we summarize recent literature that has broken new ground in the use of nanotechnology for cancer treatment with an emphasis on targeted drug delivery.


Title #973: A High-resolution Atlas and Statistical Model of the Vocal Tract from Structural MRI.
PMID: 26082883

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool in the study of muscle anatomy and functional activity in the tongue. Objective assessment of similarities and differences in tongue structure and function has been performed using unnormalized data, but this is biased by the differences in size, shape, and orientation of the structures. To remedy this, we propose a methodology to build a 3D vocal tract atlas based on structural MRI volumes from twenty normal subjects. We first constructed high-resolution volumes from three orthogonal stacks. We then removed extraneous data so that all 3D volumes contained the same anatomy. We used an unbiased diffeomorphic groupwise registration using a cross-correlation similarity metric. Principal component analysis was applied to the deformation fields to create a statistical model from the atlas. Various evaluations and applications were carried out to show the behaviour and utility of the atlas.

Title #979: Next-generation sampling: Pairing genomics with herbarium specimens provides species-level signal in Solidago (Asteraceae).
PMID: 26082877
Authors: James B JB. Beck, John C JC. Semple
Abstract: The ability to conduct species delimitation and phylogeny reconstruction with genomic data sets obtained exclusively from herbarium specimens would rapidly enhance our knowledge of large, taxonomically contentious plant genera. In this study, the utility of genotyping by sequencing is assessed in the notoriously difficult genus Solidago (Asteraceae) by attempting to obtain an informative single-nucleotide polymorphism data set from a set of specimens collected between 1970 and 2010.


Title #980: Plastid primers for angiosperm phylogenetics and phylogeography.
PMID: 26082876
Authors: Linda M LM. Prince
Abstract: PCR primers are available for virtually every region of the plastid genome. Selection of which primer pairs to use is second only to selection of the genic region. This is particularly true for research at the species/population interface.


Title #981: Development of a cognitive bias methodology for measuring low mood in chimpanzees.
PMID: 26082875
Authors: Melissa M. Bateson, Daniel D. Nettle
Abstract: There is an ethical and scientific need for objective, well-validated measures of low mood in captive chimpanzees. We describe the development of a novel cognitive task designed to measure 'pessimistic' bias in judgments of expectation of reward, a cognitive marker of low mood previously validated in a wide range of species, and report training and test data from three common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The chimpanzees were trained on an arbitrary visual discrimination in which lifting a pale grey paper cone was associated with reinforcement with a peanut, whereas lifting a dark grey cone was associated with no reward. The discrimination was trained by sequentially presenting the two cone types until significant differences in latency to touch the cone types emerged, and was confirmed by simultaneously presenting both cone types in choice trials. Subjects were subsequently tested on their latency to touch unrewarded cones of three intermediate shades of grey not previously seen. Pessimism was indicated by the similarity between the latency to touch intermediate cones and the latency to touch the trained, unreinforced, dark grey cones. Three subjects completed training and testing, two adult males and one adult female. All subjects learnt the discrimination (107-240 trials), and retained it during five sessions of testing. There was no evidence that latencies to lift intermediate cones increased over testing, as would have occurred if subjects learnt that these were never rewarded, suggesting that the task could be used for repeated testing of individual animals. There was a significant difference between subjects in their relative latencies to touch intermediate cones (pessimism index) that emerged following the second test session, and was not changed by the addition of further data. The most dominant male subject was least pessimistic, and the female most pessimistic. We argue that the task has the potential to be used to assess longitudinal changes in sub-clinical levels of low mood in chimpanzees, however further work with a larger sample of animals is required to validate this claim.


Title #982: Catch, bycatch and discards of the Galapagos Marine Reserve small-scale handline fishery.
PMID: 26082874
Authors: Johanna S JS. Zimmerhackel, Anna C AC. Schuhbauer, Paolo P. Usseglio, Lena C LC. Heel, Pelayo P. Salinas-de-LeÃ³n
Abstract: Fisheries bycatch is a significant marine conservation issue as valuable fish are wasted and protected species harmed with potential negative ecological and socio-economic consequences. Even though there are indications that the small-scale handline fishery of the Galapagos Marine Reserve has a low selectivity, information on its bycatch has never been published. We used onboard monitoring and interview data to assess the bycatch of the Galapagos handline fishery by estimating the bycatch ratio, determining species compositions of landings and bycatch, identifying fishers' reasons for discarding certain individuals, and revealing historical trends in the bycatch ratio. The estimated bycatch ratio as a function of biomass of 0.40 and a diverse species composition of target catch and bycatch confirmed the low selectivity of this fishery. Most individuals were not landed for economic motivations, either because species (77.4%) or sizes (17.7%) are unmarketable or for regulatory reasons (5.9%). We found that bycatch contributes to growth overfishing of some target species because they are discarded or used as bait before reaching their first maturity. Moreover, over half of interviewees perceived a historical decrease in bycatch ratios that was explained by a diversification of the target catch due to the reduction in abundance of the traditionally most important target species. As some target species show signs of overfishing and to date there are no specific regulations for the finfish fishery species in place, we recommend the implementation of a series of management measures to protect critical life stages of overexploited species and to improve the selectivity of the Galapagos handline fishery.


Title #983: Personality psychopathology, drug use and psychological symptoms in adolescents with substance use disorders and community controls.
PMID: 26082873
Authors: Ernesto E. MagallÃ³n-Neri, Rosa R. DÃ­az, Maria M. Forns, Javier J. Goti, Josefina J. Castro-Fornieles
Abstract: Substance use is a risk behavior that tends to increase during adolescence, a time when part of the personality is still in development. Traditionally, personality psychopathology has been measured in terms of categories, although dimensional models have demonstrated better consistency. This study aimed to analyze differences in personality profiles between adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD n = 74) and matched community controls (MCC n = 74) using the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) dimensional model. Additionally, we compared age at first drug use, level of drug use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the groups. In this study, the PSY-5 model has proved to be useful for differentiating specific personality disturbances in adolescents with SUD and community adolescents. The Disconstraint scale was particularly useful for discriminating adolescents with substance use problems and the Delinquent Attitudes facet offered the best differentiation.


Title #984: Research groups: How big should they be?
PMID: 26082872
Authors: Isabelle I. Cook, Sam S. Grange, Adam A. Eyre-Walker
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between scientific productivity and research group size is important for deciding how science should be funded. We have investigated the relationship between these variables in the life sciences in the United Kingdom using data from 398 principle investigators (PIs). We show that three measures of productivity, the number of publications, the impact factor of the journals in which papers are published and the number of citations, are all positively correlated to group size, although they all show a pattern of diminishing returns-doubling group size leads to less than a doubling in productivity. The relationships for the impact factor and the number of citations are extremely weak. Our analyses suggest that an increase in productivity will be achieved by funding more PIs with small research groups, unless the cost of employing post-docs and PhD students is less than 20% the cost of a PI. We also provide evidence that post-docs are more productive than PhD students both in terms of the number of papers they produce and where those papers are published.


Title #985: The taxonomy of a new parvicursorine alvarezsauroid specimen IVPP V20341 (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation of Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China.
PMID: 26082871

Abstract: A new parvicursorine alvarezsauroid theropod specimen IVPP V20341 from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation of Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China is described. IVPP V20341 appears to be distinguishable amongst alvarezsauroids by possible cervical procoely and relatively larger semi-circular caudal neural canals, but these features are not proposed as autapomorphies because current knowledge of alvarezsauroid necks and tails remains sparse. IVPP V20341 is distinguishable from Linhenykus-the sole parvicursorine at Bayan Mandahu-by the location of the origination points of the anterior caudal transverse processes; in IVPP V20341 this is the anterodorsal corner of the centra, whereas in Linhenykus it is the posterior end of the prezygapophyses. A number of additional tentative differences between IVPP V20341 and Linhenykus are also identified, but cannot be confirmed until further details of anatomical variation along the neck and tail are revealed by future finds. Thus, following the study of IVPP V20341 there are still seven parvicursorine species from the Upper Cretaceous Gobi Basin, but future finds could increase this to eight species.


Title #986: Local villagers' perceptions of wolves in Jiuzhaigou County, western China.
PMID: 26082870
Authors: Yu Y. Xu, Biao B. Yang, Liang L. Dou
Abstract: While there have been increasing numbers of reports of human-wolf conflict in China during recent years, little is known about the nature of this conflict. In this study, we used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to investigate local villagers' perceptions of wolves in Jiuzhaigou County, western China. We sampled nine villages with more frequent reports of wolf depredation to the local government, but included three villages near alpine pastures in which reports of depredation were less frequent. We sampled 100 residents, a subset of the local population who were more likely to have had experience with wolves. During the preceding three years, most families of the respondents grazed livestock on alpine pastures, and most of them reported that their livestock suffered from depredation by wolves. The mean value of the reported annual livestock loss rates was considerably higher in villages that reported depredation more frequently than in those with less frequent reports of depredation. Most respondents in the more frequently depredated villages perceived an increase in wolf populations, whereas many in the less frequently depredated villages perceived a decrease in wolf populations in their areas. People's attitudes towards wolves did not differ significantly between these two village categories. The majority of the respondents were negative in their attitude to wolves, despite a prevalent Tibetan culture that favors the protection of wildlife. People's negative attitude was directly related to the number of livestock owned by their family. Those with a larger number of livestock were more likely to have a negative attitude towards wolves. Factors such as village category, ethnicity, age and education level did not influence people's attitudes to wolves. We suggest that improved guarding of livestock and provision of monetary support on human resources and infrastructure may mitigate human-wolf conflicts in this region.


Title #987: Options for modulating intra-specific competition in colonial pinnipeds: the case of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Wadden Sea.
PMID: 26082869
Authors: Rory P RP. Wilson, Nikolai N. Liebsch, Agustina A. GÃ³mez-Laich, William P WP. Kay, Andrew A. Bone, Victoria J VJ. Hobson, Ursula U. Siebert
Abstract: Colonial pinnipeds may be subject to substantial consumptive competition because they are large, slow-moving central place foragers. We examined possible mechanisms for reducing this competition by examining the diving behaviour of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) after equipping 34 seals (11 females, 23 males) foraging from three locations; RÃ¸mÃ¸, Denmark and Lorenzenplate and Helgoland, Germany, in the Wadden Sea area with time-depth recorders. Analysis of 319,021 dives revealed little between-colony variation but appreciable inter-sex differences, with males diving deeper than females, but for shorter periods. Males also had higher vertical descent rates. This result suggests that males may have higher overall swim speeds, which would increase higher oxygen consumption, and may explain the shorter dive durations compared to females. Intersex variation in swim speed alone is predicted to lead to fundamental differences in the time use of three-dimensional space, which may help reduce consumptive competition in harbour seals and other colonial pinnipeds.


Title #988: A rapid assessment of post-disclosure experiences of urban HIV-positive and HIV-negative school-aged children in Kenya.
PMID: 26082868
Authors: Grace G. Gachanja
Abstract: There has been limited involvement of HIV-negative children in HIV disclosure studies; most studies conducted on the effects of disclosure on children have been with HIV-positive children and HIV-positive mother-child dyads. Seven HIV-positive and five HIV-negative children participated in a larger study conducted to understand the lived experiences of HIV-positive parents and their children during the disclosure process in Kenya. In this study, the experiences of these 12 children after receiving disclosure of their own and their parents' illnesses respectively are presented. Each child underwent an in-depth qualitative semi-structured digitally recorded interview. The recorded interviews were transcribed and loaded into NVivo8 for phenomenological data analysis. Five themes emerged from the data, indicating that HIV-positive and negative children appear to have differing post-disclosure experiences revolving around acceptance of illness, stigma and discrimination, medication consumption, sexual awareness, and use of coping mechanisms. Following disclosure, HIV-negative children accepted their parents' illnesses within a few hours to a few weeks; HIV-positive children took weeks to months to accept their own illnesses. HIV-negative children knew of high levels of stigma and discrimination within the community; HIV-positive children reported experiencing indirect incidences of stigma and discrimination. HIV-negative children wanted their parents to take their medications, stay healthy, and pay their school fees so they could have a better life in the future; HIV-positive children viewed medication consumption as an ordeal necessary to keep them healthy. HIV-negative children wanted their parents to speak to them about sexual-related matters; HIV-positive children had lingering questions about relationships, use of condoms, marriage, and childbearing options. All but one preadolescent HIV-positive child had self-identified a person to speak with for social support. When feeling overwhelmed by their circumstances, the children self-withdrew and performed positive activities (e.g., praying, watching TV, listening to the radio, singing, dancing) to help themselves feel better. Many HIV-affected families have a combination of HIV-positive and negative siblings within the household. Pending further studies conducted with larger sample sizes, the results of this study should assist healthcare professionals to better facilitate disclosure between HIV-positive parents and their children of mixed HIV statuses.


Title #989: Pyrosequencing revealed shifts of prokaryotic communities between healthy and disease-like tissues of the Red Sea sponge Crella cyathophora.
PMID: 26082867
Authors: Zhao-Ming ZM. Gao, Yong Y. Wang, Ren-Mao RM. Tian, On On OO. Lee, Yue Him YH. Wong, Zenon B ZB. Batang, Abdulaziz A. Al-Suwailem, Feras F FF. Lafi, Vladimir B VB. Bajic, Pei-Yuan PY. Qian
Abstract: Sponge diseases have been widely reported, yet the causal factors and major pathogenic microbes remain elusive. In this study, two individuals of the sponge Crella cyathophora in total that showed similar disease-like characteristics were collected from two different locations along the Red Sea coast separated by more than 30 kilometers. The disease-like parts of the two individuals were both covered by green surfaces, and the body size was much smaller compared with adjacent healthy regions. Here, using high-throughput pyrosequencing technology, we investigated the prokaryotic communities in healthy and disease-like sponge tissues as well as adjacent seawater. Microbes in healthy tissues belonged mainly to the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and were much more diverse at the phylum level than reported previously. Interestingly, the disease-like tissues from the two sponge individuals underwent shifts of prokaryotic communities and were both enriched with a novel clade affiliated with the phylum Verrucomicrobia, implying its intimate connection with the disease-like Red Sea sponge C. cyathophora. Enrichment of the phylum Verrucomicrobia was also considered to be correlated with the presence of algae assemblages forming the green surface of the disease-like sponge tissues. This finding represents an interesting case of sponge disease and is valuable for further study.


Title #990: Properties evaluation of silorane, low-shrinkage, non-flowable and flowable resin-based composites in dentistry.
PMID: 26082866
Authors: Rodrigo R RR. Maia, Rodrigo S RS. Reis, AndrÃ© F V AF. Moro, Cesar R CR. Perez, BÃ¡rbara M BM. PessÃ´a, Katia R H C KR. Dias
Abstract: Purpose. This study tested the null hypothesis that different classes of direct restorative dental materials: silorane-based resin, low-shrinkage and conventional (non-flowable and flowable) resin-based composite (RBC) do not differ from each other with regard to polymerization shrinkage, depth of cure or microhardness. Methods. 140 RBC samples were fabricated and tested by one calibrated operator. Polymerization shrinkage was measured using a gas pycnometer both before and immediately after curing with 36 J/cm(2) light energy density. Depth of cure was determined, using a penetrometer and the Knoop microhardness was tested from the top surface to a depth of 5 mm. Results. Considering polymerization shrinkage, the authors found significant differences (p < 0.05) between different materials: non-flowable RBCs showed lower values compared to flowable RBCs, with the silorane-based resin presenting the smallest shrinkage. The low shrinkage flowable composite performed similarly to non-flowable with significant statistical differences compared to the two other flowable RBCs. Regarding to depth of cure, low-shrinkage flowable RBC, were most effective compared to other groups. Microhardness was generally higher for the non-flowable vs. flowable RBCs (p < 0.05). However, the values for low-shrinkage flowable did not differ significantly from those of non-flowable, but were significantly higher than those of the other flowable RBCs. Clinical Significance. RBCs have undergone many modifications as they have evolved and represent the most relevant restorative materials in today's dental practice. This study of low-shrinkage RBCs, conventional RBCs (non-flowable and flowable) and silorane-based composite-by in vitro evaluation of volumetric shrinkage, depth of cure and microhardness-reveals that although filler content is an important determinant of polymerization shrinkage, it is not the only variable that affects properties of materials that were tested in this study.


Title #991: Modelling Tradescantia fluminensis to assess long term survival.
PMID: 26082865
Authors: Alex A. James, Sue M SM. Molloy, Agate A. Ponder-Sutton, Michael J MJ. Plank, Shona L SL. Lamoureaux, Graeme W GW. BourdÃ´t, Dave D. Kelly
Abstract: We present a simple Poisson process model for the growth of Tradescantia fluminensis, an invasive plant species that inhibits the regeneration of native forest remnants in New Zealand. The model was parameterised with data derived from field experiments in New Zealand and then verified with independent data. The model gave good predictions which showed that its underlying assumptions are sound. However, this simple model had less predictive power for outputs based on variance suggesting that some assumptions were lacking. Therefore, we extended the model to include higher variability between plants thereby improving its predictions. This high variance model suggests that control measures that promote node death at the base of the plant or restrict the main stem growth rate will be more effective than those that reduce the number of branching events. The extended model forms a good basis for assessing the efficacy of various forms of control of this weed, including the recently-released leaf-feeding tradescantia leaf beetle (Neolema ogloblini).


Title #992: Non-lethal approach identifies variability of Î´ (15)N values in the fin rays of Atlantic Goliath Grouper, Epinephelus itajara.
PMID: 26082864
Authors: Orian E OE. Tzadik, Ethan A EA. Goddard, David J DJ. Hollander, Christopher C CC. Koenig, Christopher D CD. Stallings
Abstract: The Atlantic Goliath Grouper, Epinephelus itajara, is critically endangered throughout its range but has begun to show initial signs of recovery in Florida state waters. As the population continues to rebound, researchers face a pressing need to fill the knowledge gaps about this iconic species. Here, we examined the Î´ (15)N isotopic records in fin rays collected from Atlantic Goliath Grouper, and related changes of isotopic ratios over time to life history characteristics. Fin-ray analysis was used as a non-lethal technique to sample individuals from two locations at similar latitudes from the west and east coasts of Florida, USA. Î´ (15)N data were acquired by mechanically separating the annuli of each fin ray and then analyzing the material in an Irradiance Elemental Analyzer Mass Spectrometer. The Î´ (15)N values were consistent among individuals within populations from each coast of Florida, and mirrored the expected changes over the lives of the fish. Overall, differences were found between Î´ (15)N values at juvenile life history phases versus adult phases, but the patterns associated with these differences were unique to each coastal group. We demonstrated, for the first time, that Î´ (15)N values from fin rays can be used to assess the life histories of Atlantic Goliath Grouper. The non-lethal strategies outlined here can be used to acquire information essential to the management of species of concern, such as those that are threatened or endangered.


Title #993: Rotation survival forest for right censored data.
PMID: 26082863
Authors: Lifeng L. Zhou, Qingsong Q. Xu, Hong H. Wang
Abstract: Recently, survival ensembles have found more and more applications in biological and medical research when censored time-to-event data are often confronted. In this research, we investigate the plausibility of extending a rotation forest, originally proposed for classification purpose, to survival analysis. Supported by the proper statistical analysis, we show that rotation survival forests are able to outperform the state-of-art survival ensembles on right censored data. We also provide a C-index based variable importance measure for evaluating covariates in censored survival data.


Title #994: Can sea urchins beat the heat? Sea urchins, thermal tolerance and climate change.
PMID: 26082862
Authors: Elizabeth E. Sherman
Abstract: The massive die-off of the long-spined sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, a significant reef grazer, in the mid 1980s was followed by phase shifts from coral dominated to macroalgae dominated reefs in the Caribbean. While Diadema populations have recovered in some reefs with concomitant increases in coral cover, the additional threat of increasing temperatures due to global climate change has not been investigated in adult sea urchins. In this study, I measured acute thermal tolerance of D. antillarum and that of a sympatric sea urchin not associated with coral cover, Echinometra lucunter, over winter, spring, and summer, thus exposing them to substantial natural thermal variation. Animals were taken from the wild and placed in laboratory tanks in room temperature water (â¼22 Â°C) that was then heated at 0.16-0.3 Â°C min(-1) and the righting behavior of individual sea urchins was recorded. I measured both the temperature at which the animal could no longer right itself (T LoR) and the righting time at temperatures below the T LoR. In all seasons, D. antillarum exhibited a higher mean T LoR than E. lucunter. The mean T LoR of each species increased with increasing environmental temperature revealing that both species acclimatize to seasonal changes in temperatures. The righting times of D. antillarum were much shorter than those of E. lucunter. The longer relative spine length of Diadema compared to that of Echinometra may contribute to their shorter righting times, but does not explain their higher T LoR. The thermal safety margin (the difference between the mean collection temperature and the mean T LoR) was between 3.07-3.66 Â°C for Echinometra and 3.79-5.67 Â°C for Diadema. While these thermal safety margins exceed present day temperatures, they are modest compared to those of temperate marine invertebrates. If sea temperatures increase more rapidly than can be accommodated by the sea urchins (either by genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, or both), this will have important consequences for the structure of coral reefs.


Title #995: A mathematical model for predicting glucose levels in critically-ill patients: the PIGnOLI model.
PMID: 26082861
Authors: Zhongheng Z. Zhang
Abstract: Background and Objectives. Glycemic control is of paramount importance in the intensive care unit. Presently, several BG control algorithms have been developed for clinical trials, but they are mostly based on experts' opinion and consensus. There are no validated models predicting how glucose levels will change after initiating of insulin infusion in critically ill patients. The study aimed to develop an equation for initial insulin dose setting. Methods. A large critical care database was employed for the study. Linear regression model fitting was employed. Retested blood glucose was used as the independent variable. Insulin rate was forced into the model. Multivariable fractional polynomials and interaction terms were used to explore the complex relationships among covariates. The overall fit of the model was examined by using residuals and adjusted R-squared values. Regression diagnostics were used to explore the influence of outliers on the model. Main Results. A total of 6,487 ICU admissions requiring insulin pump therapy were identified. The dataset was randomly split into two subsets at 7 to 3 ratio. The initial model comprised fractional polynomials and interactions terms. However, this model was not stable by excluding several outliers. I fitted a simple linear model without interaction. The selected prediction model (Predicting Glucose Levels in ICU, PIGnOLI) included variables of initial blood glucose, insulin rate, PO volume, total parental nutrition, body mass index (BMI), lactate, congestive heart failure, renal failure, liver disease, time interval of BS recheck, dextrose rate. Insulin rate was significantly associated with blood glucose reduction (coefficient: -0.52, 95% CI [-1.03, -0.01]). The parsimonious model was well validated with the validation subset, with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.8259. Conclusion. The study developed the PIGnOLI model for the initial insulin dose setting. Furthermore, experimental study is mandatory to examine whether adjustment of the insulin infusion rate based on PIGnOLI will benefit patients' outcomes.


Title #996: Uneven distribution of enamel in the tooth crown of a Plains Zebra (Equus quagga).
PMID: 26082860
Authors: Daniela E DE. Winkler, Thomas M TM. Kaiser
Abstract: Unworn teeth of herbivorous mammals are not immediately functional. They have to be partially worn to expose enamel ridges which can then act as shear-cutting blades to break the food down. We use the Plains Zebra (Equus quagga) as a hypsodont, herbivorous model organism to investigate how initial wear of the tooth crown is controlled by underlying structures. We find that the enamel proportion is smaller at the apical half of the tooth crown in all upper tooth positions and suggest that lower enamel content here could promote early wear. Besides this uneven enamel distribution, we note that the third molar has a higher overall enamel content than any other tooth position. The M3 is thus likely to have a slightly different functional trait in mastication, resisting highest bite forces along the tooth row and maintaining functionality when anterior teeth are already worn down.


Title #997: Musculoskeletal modelling of an ostrich (Struthio camelus) pelvic limb: influence of limb orientation on muscular capacity during locomotion.
PMID: 26082859
Authors: John R JR. Hutchinson, Jeffery W JW. Rankin, Jonas J. Rubenson, Kate H KH. Rosenbluth, Robert A RA. Siston, Scott L SL. Delp
Abstract: We developed a three-dimensional, biomechanical computer model of the 36 major pelvic limb muscle groups in an ostrich (Struthio camelus) to investigate muscle function in this, the largest of extant birds and model organism for many studies of locomotor mechanics, body size, anatomy and evolution. Combined with experimental data, we use this model to test two main hypotheses. We first query whether ostriches use limb orientations (joint angles) that optimize the moment-generating capacities of their muscles during walking or running. Next, we test whether ostriches use limb orientations at mid-stance that keep their extensor muscles near maximal, and flexor muscles near minimal, moment arms. Our two hypotheses relate to the control priorities that a large bipedal animal might evolve under biomechanical constraints to achieve more effective static weight support. We find that ostriches do not use limb orientations to optimize the moment-generating capacities or moment arms of their muscles. We infer that dynamic properties of muscles or tendons might be better candidates for locomotor optimization. Regardless, general principles explaining why species choose particular joint orientations during locomotion are lacking, raising the question of whether such general principles exist or if clades evolve different patterns (e.g., weighting of muscle force-length or force-velocity properties in selecting postures). This leaves theoretical studies of muscle moment arms estimated for extinct animals at an impasse until studies of extant taxa answer these questions. Finally, we compare our model's results against those of two prior studies of ostrich limb muscle moment arms, finding general agreement for many muscles. Some flexor and extensor muscles exhibit self-stabilization patterns (posture-dependent switches between flexor/extensor action) that ostriches may use to coordinate their locomotion. However, some conspicuous areas of disagreement in our results illustrate some cautionary principles. Importantly, tendon-travel empirical measurements of muscle moment arms must be carefully designed to preserve 3D muscle geometry lest their accuracy suffer relative to that of anatomically realistic models. The dearth of accurate experimental measurements of 3D moment arms of muscles in birds leaves uncertainty regarding the relative accuracy of different modelling or experimental datasets such as in ostriches. Our model, however, provides a comprehensive set of 3D estimates of muscle actions in ostriches for the first time, emphasizing that avian limb mechanics are highly three-dimensional and complex, and how no muscles act purely in the sagittal plane. A comparative synthesis of experiments and models such as ours could provide powerful synthesis into how anatomy, mechanics and control interact during locomotion and how these interactions evolve. Such a framework could remove obstacles impeding the analysis of muscle function in extinct taxa.


Title #998: Can endocranial volume be estimated accurately from external skull measurements in great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus)?
PMID: 26082858
Authors: Corina J CJ. Logan, Christin R CR. Palmstrom
Abstract: There is an increasing need to validate and collect data approximating brain size on individuals in the field to understand what evolutionary factors drive brain size variation within and across species. We investigated whether we could accurately estimate endocranial volume (a proxy for brain size), as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scans, using external skull measurements and/or by filling skulls with beads and pouring them out into a graduated cylinder for male and female great-tailed grackles. We found that while females had higher correlations than males, estimations of endocranial volume from external skull measurements or beads did not tightly correlate with CT volumes. We found no accuracy in the ability of external skull measures to predict CT volumes because the prediction intervals for most data points overlapped extensively. We conclude that we are unable to detect individual differences in endocranial volume using external skull measurements. These results emphasize the importance of validating and explicitly quantifying the predictive accuracy of brain size proxies for each species and each sex.

Title #1007: Coexistence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Superior Vena Cava Syndromes Due to Substernal Goitre in a Patient With Respiratory Failure: A Case Report.
PMID: 26082848
Authors: Mehtap M. Tunc, Hilal H. Sazak, Bulent B. Karlilar, Fatma F. Ulus, Irfan I. Tastepe
Abstract: Substernal goiter may rarely cause superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) owing to venous compression, and cause acute respiratory failure due to tracheal compression. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may rarely occur when there is a narrowing of upper airway by edema and vascular congestion resulting from SVCS.


Title #1008: Unscheduled Return Visits and Leaving the Chest Pain Unit Against Medical Advice.
PMID: 26082847
Authors: Yaser Y. Jenab, Shima S. Haghani, Arash A. Jalali, Farzad F. Darabi
Abstract: Rate of Unscheduled Return Visits (URVs) to the Emergency Department has been considered as a key indicator for evaluating the quality of the Emergency Department care for decades. A higher rate of URVs can have a negative impact on the quality of health care. Investigations of the reasons for these returns have indicated that many of these visits can be preventable.

Title #1010: A new electrode placement method for obtaining 12-lead ECGs.
PMID: 26082845
Authors: Gabriel M GM. Khan
Abstract: Worldwide, more than 50 million ECGs are carried out annually. Studies show that the standard wrist-ankle placement method may produce poor quality ECGs. Factors including limb movement, tremor, anxiety, cold extremities cause artefacts (distortions of the baseline and ECG waveforms). A problem exists. Physicians face a challenge interpreting poor quality ECGs. Diagnostic delays occur. Patients are subjected to recalls; compassion initiated this study. Torso (modified) leads are favoured as they provide rapid acquisition of better quality ECGs, but cause erroneous electrocardiography. Investigators have not attempted to correct these errors. This study analyses the errors and aims to rectify them.

PMID: 26082843
Authors: Roshan R. Fatima, Vijay Suresh VS. Akhade, Debosree D. Pal, Satyanarayana Mr SM. Rao
Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs are emerging as key players in various fundamental biological processes. We highlight the varied molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs modulate gene expression in diverse cellular contexts and their role in early mammalian development in this review. Furthermore, it is being increasingly recognized that altered expression of lncRNAs is specifically associated with tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. We discuss various lncRNAs implicated in different cancer types with a focus on their clinical applications as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the pathology of diverse cancers.

Title #1015: Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in a severely overweight child with a multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus infection. AÂ case report and review.
PMID: 26082840
Authors: N. N. Wagner, C A CA. Wyler-Lazarevic, S. S. Yerly, C. C. Samer, G. G. Peytavin, K M KM. Posfay-Barbe, A. A. Calmy, J. J. Ambrosioni
Abstract: The management of multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (MDR HIV) infections in children is particularly challenging due to the lack of experience with new drugs. Dolutegravir, combined with an optimized antiretroviral background therapy, is promising for the treatment of MDR HIV and has been approved recently for adults and adolescents. Data for children are extremely limited. We describe the efficacy, safety and plasmatic levels of a dolutegravir-based, complex active antiretroviral treatment regimen in a severely overweight 11-year-old child infected with an MDR HIV strain.

Title #1017: Enhancing the discovery and development of immunotherapies for cancer using quantitative and systems pharmacology: Interleukin-12 as a case study.
PMID: 26082838
Authors: David J DJ. Klinke
Abstract: Recent clinical successes of immune checkpoint modulators have unleashed a wave of enthusiasm associated with cancer immunotherapy. However, this enthusiasm is dampened by persistent translational hurdles associated with cancer immunotherapy that mirror the broader pharmaceutical industry. Specifically, the challenges associated with drug discovery and development stem from an incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms in humans that are targeted by a potential drug and the financial implications of clinical failures. Sustaining progress in expanding the clinical benefit provided by cancer immunotherapy requires reliably identifying new mechanisms of action. Along these lines, quantitative and systems pharmacology (QSP) has been proposed as a means to invigorate the drug discovery and development process. In this review, I discuss two central themes of QSP as applied in the context of cancer immunotherapy. The first theme focuses on a network-centric view of biology as a contrast to a "one-gene, one-receptor, one-mechanism" paradigm prevalent in contemporary drug discovery and development. This theme has been enabled by the advances in wet-lab capabilities to assay biological systems at increasing breadth and resolution. The second theme focuses on integrating mechanistic modeling and simulation with quantitative wet-lab studies. Drawing from recent QSP examples, large-scale mechanistic models that integrate phenotypic signaling-, cellular-, and tissue-level behaviors have the potential to lower many of the translational hurdles associated with cancer immunotherapy. These include prioritizing immunotherapies, developing mechanistic biomarkers that stratify patient populations and that reflect the underlying strength and dynamics of a protective host immune response, and facilitate explicit sharing of our understanding of the underlying biology using mechanistic models as vehicles for dialogue. However, creating such models require a modular approach that assumes that the biological networks remain similar in health and disease. As oncogenesis is associated with re-wiring of these biological networks, I also describe an approach that combines mechanistic modeling with quantitative wet-lab experiments to identify ways in which malignant cells alter these networks, using Interleukin-12 as an example. Collectively, QSP represents a new holistic approach that may have profound implications for how translational science is performed.

Title #1019: Immune modulating effects of cyclophosphamide and treatment with tumor lysate/CpG synergize to eliminate murine neuroblastoma.
PMID: 26082836
Authors: Jill A JA. Gershan, Kristen M KM. Barr, James J JJ. Weber, Weiqing W. Jing, Bryon D BD. Johnson
Abstract: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of neural crest origin. Despite aggressive treatment, mortality remains at 40 % for patients with high-risk disseminated disease, underscoring the need to test new combinations of therapies. In murine tumor models, our laboratory previously showed that T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses improve in the context of lymphopenia. The goal of this study was to incorporate lymphodepletion into an effective immune therapy that can be easily translated into neuroblastoma standard of care. Based on the lymphodepleting effects of cyclophosphamide, we hypothesized that cyclophosphamide would synergize with the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), to produce a T cell-mediated anti-neuroblastoma effect.


Title #1020: Safety and efficacy of ipilimumab to treat advanced melanoma in the setting of liver transplantation.
PMID: 26082835
Authors: Rita E RE. Morales, Alexander N AN. Shoushtari, Michelle M MM. Walsh, Priya P. Grewal, Evan J EJ. Lipson, Richard D RD. Carvajal
Abstract: Ipilimumab is a first-in-class immunological checkpoint blockade agent and monoclonal antibody against Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) that has demonstrated survival benefit and durable responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. To date, solid organ transplant recipients have been excluded from clinical trials with cancer immunotherapies on the basis of their concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive agents. We present the first case to our knowledge of a patient with advanced cutaneous melanoma receiving ipilimumab status post orthotopic liver transplantation with a partial response. Transaminitis was observed 4Â months after administration of ipilimumab that resolved with close observation. No evidence of graft rejection has been observed to date. This case advocates for further investigation of the safety and efficacy of cancer immunotherapies in solid organ transplant recipients.


Title #1021: Peptide Decoration of Nanovehicles to Achieve Active Targeting and Pathology-Responsive Cellular Uptake for Bone Metastasis Chemotherapy.
PMID: 26082834
Authors: Xuli X. Wang, Ye Y. Yang, Huizhen H. Jia, Wanjian W. Jia, Scott S. Miller, Beth B. Bowman, Jun J. Feng, Fenghuang F. Zhan
Abstract: To improve bone metastases chemotherapy, a peptide-conjugated diblock copolymer consisting of chimeric peptide, poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(trimethylene carbonate) (Pep-b-PEG-b-PTMC) is fabricated as a drug carrier capable of bone-seeking targeting as well as pathology-responsive charge reversal to ensure effective cellular uptake at the lesion sites. The chimeric peptide CKGHPGGPQAsp8 consists of an osteotropic anionic Asp8, a cathepsin K (CTSK)-cleavable substrate (HPGGPQ) and cationic residue tethered to polymer chain. Pep-b-PEG-b-PTMC can spontaneously self-assemble into negatively charged nanomicelles (~75 nm). As to the model drug of doxorubicin, Pep-b-PEG-b-PTM shows 30.0 Â± 1 % and 90.1 Â± 2 % for loading content and loading efficiency, respectively. High bone binding capability is demonstrated with that 66 % of Pep-b-PEG-b-PTMC micelles are able to bind to hydroxyl apatite, whereas less than 15 % is for Pep-free micelles. The nanomicelles exhibit a negative-to-positive charge conversion from -18.5 Â± 1.9 mV to 15.2 Â± 1.8 mV upon exposure to CTSK, an enzyme overexpressed in bone metastatic microenvironments. Such a pathology-responsive transition would lead to remarkably enhanced cellular uptake of the nanomicelles upon reaching lesion sites, thus improving the drug efficacy as verified by the in vitro cytotoxicity assay and the in vivo study in myeloma-bearing 5TGM1 mice model.


Title #1022: Treatment of Recurrent Hepatitis C Genotype-4 Post-Liver Transplantation with Sofosbuvir plus Simeprevir.

Authors: Mustafa M. Ascha, Mona M. Ascha, N N NN. Zein, N. N. Alkhouri, B. B. Eghtesad, K. K. Abu-Elmagd, T. T. Diago, I A IA. Hanouneh
Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a leading indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) worldwide. Recurrence of HCV following OLT is universal. There is scarcity of data on the post-OLT treatment of HCV genotype-4-the predominant genotype in North Africa and the Middle East. Herein, we present three patients who have experienced HCV genotype-4 recurrence post-OLT. All three patients were interferon-naive and were treated with simeprivir (SIM) and sofosbuvir (SOF) combination therapy for 12-24 weeks. The data from this case series show that SIM+SOF are well-tolerated and effective for achieving viral clearance in HCV genotype-4 post-OLT patients. Given the limited nature of a case series, further research must be pursued regarding post-OLT HCV genotype-4 responses to direct-acting anti-viral therapy.

Title #1026: Tolerance Induction in Liver.
PMID: 26082828
Authors: M H MH. Karimi, B. B. Geramizadeh, S A SA. Malek-Hosseini
Abstract: Liver is an exclusive anatomical and immunological organ that displays a considerable tolerance effect. Liver allograft acceptance is shown to occur spontaneously within different species. Although in human transplant patients tolerance is rarely seen, the severity level and cellular mechanisms of transplant rejection vary. Non-paranchymal liver cells, including Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and resident dendritic cells may participate in liver tolerogenicity. The mentioned cells secret anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-Î² and IL-10 and express negative co-stimulatory molecules like PD-L1 to mediate immunosuppression. Other mechanisms such as microchimerism, soluble major histocompatibility complex and regulatory T cells may take part in tolerance induction. Understanding the mechanisms involved in liver transplant rejection/tolerance helps us to improve therapeutic options to induce hepatic tolerance.


Title #1027: Computer-aided Molecular Design of Compounds Targeting Histone Modifying Enzymes.
PMID: 26082827
Authors: Federico F. Andreoli, Alberto A. Del Rio
Abstract: Growing evidences show that epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles in the genesis and progression of many physiopathological processes. As a result, research in epigenetic grew at a fast pace in the last decade. In particular, the study of histone post-translational modifications encountered an extraordinary progression and many modifications have been characterized and associated to fundamental biological processes and pathological conditions. Histone modifications are the catalytic result of a large set of enzyme families that operate covalent modifications on specific residues at the histone tails. Taken together, these modifications elicit a complex and concerted processing that greatly contribute to the chromatin remodeling and may drive different pathological conditions, especially cancer. For this reason, several epigenetic targets are currently under validation for drug discovery purposes and different academic and industrial programs have been already launched to produce the first pre-clinical and clinical outcomes. In this scenario, computer-aided molecular design techniques are offering important tools, mainly as a consequence of the increasing structural information available for these targets. In this mini-review we will briefly discuss the most common types of known histone modifications and the corresponding operating enzymes by emphasizing the computer-aided molecular design approaches that can be of use to speed-up the efforts to generate new pharmaceutically relevant compounds.


Title #1028: REGULARIZED 3D FUNCTIONAL REGRESSION FOR BRAIN IMAGE DATA VIA HAAR WAVELETS.
PMID: 26082826
Authors: Xuejing X. Wang, Bin B. Nan, Ji J. Zhu, Robert R. Koeppe
Abstract: The primary motivation and application in this article come from brain imaging studies on cognitive impairment in elderly subjects with brain disorders. We propose a regularized Haar wavelet-based approach for the analysis of three-dimensional brain image data in the framework of functional data analysis, which automatically takes into account the spatial information among neighboring voxels. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed approach and its ability to identify related regions to the outcome of interest, with the underlying assumption that only few relatively small subregions are truly predictive of the outcome of interest. We then apply the proposed approach to searching for brain subregions that are associated with cognition using PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and normal controls.

Title #1030: Practice and research in Australian massage therapy: a national workforce survey.
PMID: 26082824
Authors: Jonathan L JL. Wardle, Rebecca R. Barnett, Jon J. Adams
Abstract: Massage is the largest complementary medicine profession in Australia, in terms of public utilisation, practitioner distribution, and number of practitioners, and is being increasingly integrated into the Australian health care system. However, despite the increasing importance of massage therapists in Australian health care delivery, or the increased practice and education obligations this may entail, there has been little exploration of practice, research, and education characteristics of the Australian massage therapist workforce.


Title #1031: Bilateral Multifocal Hamartoma of the Chest Wall in an Infant.
PMID: 26082822
Authors: Erdem E. Yilmaz, Oguz Bulent OB. Erol, Melih M. Pekcan, Gokcen G. Gundogdu, Bilge B. Bilgic, Feryal F. Gun, Ensar E. Yekeler
Abstract: Hamartoma of the thoracic wall is a rare benign tumor that occurs in infancy and can be mistaken for a malignancy due to its clinical and imaging features. Hamartomas are extrapleural soft tissue lesions that cause rib expansion and destruction and appear on imaging as cystic areas with fluid levels and calcification. They can cause scoliosis, pressure on the neighboring lung parenchyma and mediastinal displacement. While conservative treatment is recommended in asymptomatic cases, growing lesions require surgical excision.

Authors: Camilla C. Wendt, Annika A. Lindblom, Brita B. Arver, Anna A. von Wachenfeldt, Sara S. Margolin
Abstract: Approximately 30Â % of all breast cancer is at least partly attributed to hereditary factors. Familial breast cancer is often inherited in the context of cancer syndromes. The most commonly mutated genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2 in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The genetic background in families with hereditary breast cancer without predisposing germ line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (non-BRCA families) is still to a large extent unclear even though progress has been made. The aim of this study was to compare cancer proportions in familial non-BRCA hereditary breast cancer compared to the general population in search of putative new breast cancer syndromes.

Title #1038: Association of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 C-1562T Polymorphism with Genetic Susceptibility to Myocardial Infarction: A Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 26082814
Authors: Zhang Z. Juan, Zhang Z. Wei-Guo, Song S. Heng-Liang, Wan W. Da-Guo
Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is the major cause of death by disease in the world. Many studies have identified the associations between matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) C-1562T polymorphisms and MI. However, the results remain inconclusive. To clarify the role of MMP9 C-1562T polymorphism in MI risk, we conducted a systematic review and large-scale meta-analysis.


Title #1039: Changes in Skeletal Tumor Activity on (18)F-choline PET/CT in Patients Receiving (223)Radium Radionuclide Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.
PMID: 26082811
Authors: Kyle S KS. Miyazaki, Yu Y. Kuang, Sandi A SA. Kwee
Abstract: Radium-223 dichloride is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical shown to prolong survival in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and symptomatic skeletal metastases. This report describes in two patientsÂ the acute changes in bone metastatic activity detected by F-18 choline PET/CT imaging midway during treatment with radium-223 dichloride. In addition to visual and standardized uptake value analysis, changes in the whole-body tumor burden were quantified by measuring the difference in net metabolically active tumor volume (MATV) and total lesion activity (TLA) between pre- and mid-treatment PET scans. After the third dose of radium-223 dichloride, near-total disappearance of abnormal skeletal activity was observed in one case (net MATV change from 260.7 to 0.8Â cc; net TLA change from 510.7 to 2.1), while a heterogeneous tumor response was observed in the other (net MATV change from 272.2 to 241.3Â cc; net TLA change from 987.1 to 779.4). Corresponding normalization and persistent elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in these cases, respectively. Further research is needed to determine the predictive value of serial F-18 choline PET/CT imaging in patients receiving radium-223 dichloride for CRPC.


Title #1040: Lymphadenopathy by Scrub Typhus Mimicking Metastasis on FDG PET/CT in a Patient with a History of Breast Cancer.
PMID: 26082810
Authors: Jeong Won JW. Lee, Sang Mi SM. Lee, Kyu Taek KT. Lee, Sung Young SY. Kim, Sun Wook SW. Han, Shin Young SY. Kim
Abstract: We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with left-sided breast cancer who showed lymphadenopathy mimicking metastatic lesions. She underwent surveillance (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after treatment. PET/CT demonstrated multiple lymphadenopathies with increased FDG uptake, most notably in the right axilla. She had an eschar on the right axillary area, and her serologic test was positive for anti-Orientia tsutsugamushi IgM antibody. Ten months after the treatment, follow-up FDG PET/CT and ultrasonography showed improvement in generalized lymphadenopathy.


Title #1041: Precision of SPECT/CT Allows the Diagnosis of a Hidden Brodie's Abscess of the Talus in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease.
PMID: 26082809

Abstract: Brodie's abscess is a rare subacute osteomyelitis that can be found in sickle cell disease along with other bone complications. A 21-year-old female with sickle cell disease was presenting frequently to the medical casualty department for painful vasoocclusive crises and for persistent ankle pain and swelling. Hybrid imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) incidentally revealed Brodie's abscess in the talus bone of the ankle, causing persisting long-standing pain. SPECT-CT is a modern technology used to scan bone to detect both anatomical and functional abnormalities with high specificity. Brodie's abscess is a rare bone inflammation that could be a hidden cause of pain and infection in sickle cell disease. Although rare, this lesion requires more attention in patients with sickle cell disease because their immunocompromised status renders them prone to this infection.

Abstract: A dysregulation in the metabolism of lipids may be an early marker of autoimmunity in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). It would be of general importance to identify metabolic patterns that would predict the risk for T1D later in life. The aim of this study was to perform a prospective evaluation of glutamine and phospholipids levels in Brazilian first degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T1D in a mean interval of 5Â years.

Abstract: The increased use of small-molecule compound screening by new users from a variety of different academic backgrounds calls for adequate software to administer, appraise, analyse and exchange information obtained from screening experiments. While software and spreadsheet solutions exist, there is a need for software that can be easily deployed and is convenient to use.


Title #1044: Calculating an optimal box size for ligand docking and virtual screening against experimental and predicted binding pockets.
PMID: 26082804
Authors: Wei P WP. Feinstein, Michal M. Brylinski
Abstract: Computational approaches have emerged as an instrumental methodology in modern research. For example, virtual screening by molecular docking is routinely used in computer-aided drug discovery. One of the critical parameters for ligand docking is the size of a search space used to identify low-energy binding poses of drug candidates. Currently available docking packages often come with a default protocol for calculating the box size, however, many of these procedures have not been systematically evaluated.


Title #1045: Hemostatic powder spray: a new method for managing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The management of gastrointestinal bleeding is often challenging, depending on its location and severity. To date, widely accepted hemostatic treatment options include injection of epinephrine and tissue adhesives such as cyanoacrylate, ablative therapy with contact modalities such as thermal coagulation with heater probe and bipolar hemostatic forceps, noncontact modalities such as photodynamic therapy and argon plasma coagulation, and mechanical hemostasis with band ligation, endoscopic hemoclips, and over-the-scope clips. These approaches, albeit effective in achieving hemostasis, are associated with a 5-10% rebleeding risk. New simple, effective, universal, and safe methods are needed to address some of the challenges posed by the current endoscopic hemostatic techniques. The use of a novel hemostatic powder spray appears to be effective and safe in controlling upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Although initial reports of hemostatic powder spray as an innovative approach to manage gastrointestinal bleeding are promising, further studies are needed to support and confirm its efficacy and safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility, clinical efficacy, and safety of hemostatic powder spray (Hemospray, Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA) as a new method for managing gastrointestinal bleeding. In this review article, we performed an extensive literature search summarizing case reports and case series of Hemospray for the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications, features, technique, deployment, success rate, complications, and limitations are discussed. The combined technical and clinical success rate of Hemospray was 88.5% (207/234) among the human subjects and 81.8% (9/11) among the porcine models studied. Rebleeding occurred within 72 hours post-treatment in 38 patients (38/234; 16.2%) and in three porcine models (3/11; 27.3%). No procedure-related adverse events were associated with the use of Hemospray. Hemospray appears to be a safe and effective approach in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding.


Title #1046: Evidence that homozygous PTPRD gene microdeletion causes trigonocephaly, hearing loss, and intellectual disability.
PMID: 26082802

Abstract: The premature fusion of metopic sutures results in the clinical phenotype of trigonocephaly. An association of this characteristic with the monosomy 9p syndrome is well established and the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase gene (PTPRD), located in the 9p24.1p23 region and encoding a major component of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization, is considered as a good candidate to be responsible for this form of craniosynostosis. Moreover PTPRD is known to recruit multiple postsynaptic partners such as IL1RAPL1 which gene alterations lead to non syndromic intellectual disability (ID).


Title #1047: Improved adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with endocrine responsive disease.
PMID: 26082801
Authors: Aron A. Goldhirsch, Marco M. Colleoni, Meredith M. Regan
Abstract: Results from two randomised global trials (SOFT & TEXT) designed to newly define the most effective components of adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with endocrine responsive disease, showed that for some, those with high risk of relapse, the use of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane together with ovarian function suppression with GnRH analogue (triptorelin) yielded the most favourable treatment outcome compared with tamoxifen. For women with low risk of relapse, treatment with tamoxifen was similar to ovarian function suppression together with either exemestane or tamoxifen. For women with intermediate risk of relapse, ovarian function suppression added to tamoxifen was not inferior to exemestane, while it resulted in superior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone. Now, these trials provide critical information for the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer and are important for the development of future trials for further improvement of adjuvant endocrine therapies for the younger population.


Title #1048: Sequential chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer after induction chemotherapy: an induction chemotherapy schedule more suited to a limited resource setting.
PMID: 26082800
Authors: Aparna A. Gangopadhyay, Partha P. Nath, Jaydip J. Biswas
Abstract: In our experience, induction docetaxel, platinum, and fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy and sequential chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer lowers compliance owing to their considerable toxicity. Most of our head and neck cancer patients have locally advanced disease at presentation. Physicians frequently prefer paclitaxel-cisplatin induction chemotherapy instead, because of better patient tolerance.


Title #1049: Hypercalcaemia with disseminated osteolytic lesions: a rare presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
PMID: 26082799
Authors: Rajitha R. Lokadasan, Shruti S. Prem, Sumod Mathew SM. Koshy, A V AV. Jayasudha
Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) presenting with hypercalcaemia and lytic bone lesions is a rare event in children unlike adults. We report a 15-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and hypercalcaemia. He had normal peripheral blood count and the peripheral smear did not show blast. The bone marrow examination revealed Pre B ALL phenotype with aberrant expression of CD13. The skeletal survey showed osteolytic lesions. Hypercalcaemia was treated with zoledronic acid. He attained remission only after three lines of intensive chemotherapy protocols. He was planned for stem cell transplant. Meanwhile, he relapsed and died. A review of the literature also highlights characteristics similar to our case.


Title #1050: Primed for cancer: Li Fraumeni Syndrome and the pre-cancerous niche.
PMID: 26082798
Authors: Pan P. Pantziarka
Abstract: The complex relationship between tumour and stroma is still being elucidated but it is clear that cancer is a disease of more than just malignant cells. However, the dominant focus of our current understanding of Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) remains on the function of p53 as 'guardian of the genome'. Recent evidence shows that the TP53 gene is at the nexus of a wider range of functions, including aspects of cellular metabolism, aging and immunity. Incorporating this broader picture of the role of TP53 together with our understanding of the role of the host microenvironment in cancer initiation and progression gives a more nuanced picture of LFS. Furthermore, there is clinical evidence to suggest that the host environment in healthy individuals with LFS already includes some of the features of a 'pre-cancerous niche' that makes cancer initiation more likely. It is suggested, finally, that there are pharmacological interventions capable of altering this pre-cancerous niche, thus potentially reducing the cancer risk in individuals with LFS.


Title #1051: Diagnosis and management of lentigo maligna: a review.
PMID: 26082796
Authors: Julia M JM. Kasprzak, Yaohui G YG. Xu
Abstract: Lentigo maligna is a melanocytic neoplasm occurring on sun-exposed skin, usually on the head and neck, of middle-aged and elderly patients. It is thought to represent the in situ phase of lentigo maligna melanoma. The ill-defined nature and potentially large size of lesions can pose significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. The goal of therapy is to cure the lesions in order to prevent development of invasive disease, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice to achieve clear histological margins. Nonsurgical treatment modalities have been reported; however, evidence is lacking to support their use. Age, general health, and comorbidities need to be taken into account when deciding the right treatment modality for each individual patient.


Title #1052: Ribosomal accretion, apriorism and the phylogenetic method: a response to Petrov and Williams.
PMID: 26082795
Authors: Derek D. Caetano-AnollÃ©s, Gustavo G. Caetano-AnollÃ©s
Abstract: Historical (ideographic) and non-historical (nomothetic) studies of ribosomal accretion appear to arrive at diametrically opposite conclusions. Phylogenetic analysis of thousands of RNA molecules and protein structures in hundreds of genomes supports the structural origin of the ribosome in RNA decoding and ribosomal mechanics. Predictions from extant features in a handful of rRNA structural models of the large ribosomal subunit support its origin in protein biosynthesis. In recent correspondence, one of us reported that correcting dismissals of conflicting data and avoiding unwarranted assumptions of the nomothetic method reconciled conclusions. In response, Petrov and Williams dismissed our arguments claiming we did not understand their algorithmic model of ribosomal apical growth. Instead, they controverted the historical approach. Here we show that their objections to the phylogenetic method are unjustified, that their algorithm subjectively guarantees back-in-time molecular deconstructions toward the protein biosynthetic core, and that processes of ribosomal growth are much more complex. We prompt abandoning apriorism, decreasing ad hoc hypotheses and integrating historical and non-historical scientific methods.


Title #1053: Revisiting demographic processes in cattle with genome-wide population genetic analysis.

Abstract: The domestication of the aurochs took place approximately 10,000 years ago giving rise to the two main types of domestic cattle known today, taurine (Bos taurus) domesticated somewhere on or near the Fertile Crescent, and indicine (Bos indicus) domesticated in the Indus Valley. However, although cattle have historically played a prominent role in human society the exact origin of many extant breeds is not well known. Here we used a combination of medium and high-density Illumina Bovine SNP arrays (i.e., ~54,000 and ~770,000 SNPs, respectively), genotyped for over 1300 animals representing 56 cattle breeds, to describe the relationships among major European cattle breeds and detect patterns of admixture among them. Our results suggest modern cross-breeding and ancient hybridisation events have both played an important role, including with animals of indicine origin. We use these data to identify signatures of selection reflecting both domestication (hypothesized to produce a common signature across breeds) and local adaptation (predicted to exhibit a signature of selection unique to a single breed or group of related breeds with a common history) to uncover additional demographic complexity of modern European cattle.


Title #1054: Connecting two arrays: the emerging role of actin-microtubule cross-linking motor proteins.
PMID: 26082793
Authors: RenÃ© R. Schneider, Staffan S. Persson
Abstract: The cytoskeleton of plant cells, consisting of actin filaments (AFs) and microtubules (MTs), is a central structure for various intracellular processes, such as cell division, isotropic and polar growth, vesicle transport, cell shape, and morphogenesis. Pharmaceutical and genetic studies have provided indications for interdependent cross-talk between the cytoskeletal components. Recent live-cell imaging studies have cemented this notion, in particular when the cytoskeleton rearranges. However, the proteins that directly mediate this cross-talk have remained largely elusive. Recent data indicate that certain proteins can interact with both cytoskeletal arrays at the same time, and hence connecting them. In this review, we summarize the recent literature of the AF- and MT-interactors, mainly focusing on a plant-specific mediator of cytoskeletal cross-talk: the calponin homology (CH) domain-containing kinesin-14 motor proteins (KCHs).


Title #1055: Products of lipid, protein and RNA oxidation as signals and regulators of gene expression in plants.
PMID: 26082792
Authors: Jagna J. Chmielowska-BÄk, Karolina K. IzbiaÅska, Joanna J. Deckert
Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are engaged in several processes essential for normal cell functioning, such as differentiation, anti-microbial defense, stimulus sensing and signaling. Interestingly, recent studies imply that cellular signal transduction and gene regulation are mediated not only directly by ROS but also by the molecules derived from ROS-mediated oxidation. Lipid peroxidation leads to non-enzymatic formation of oxylipins. These molecules were shown to modulate expression of signaling associated genes including genes encoding phosphatases, kinases and transcription factors. Oxidized peptides derived from protein oxidation might be engaged in organelle-specific ROS signaling. In turn, oxidation of particular mRNAs leads to decrease in the level of encoded proteins and thus, contributes to the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Present mini review summarizes latest findings concerning involvement of products of lipid, protein and RNA oxidation in signal transduction and gene regulation.


Title #1056: Terahertz time domain spectroscopy allows contactless monitoring of grapevine water status.
PMID: 26082791
Authors: Luis G LG. Santesteban, InÃ©s I. Palacios, Carlos C. Miranda, Juan C JC. Iriarte, JosÃ© B JB. Royo, RamÃ³n R. Gonzalo
Abstract: Agriculture is the sector with the greatest water consumption, since food production is frequently based on crop irrigation. Proper irrigation management requires reliable information on plant water status, but all the plant-based methods to determine it suffer from several inconveniences, mainly caused by the necessity of destructive sampling or of alteration of the plant organ due to contact installation. The aim of this work is to test if terahertz (THz) time domain reflectance measurements made on the grapevine trunk allows contactless monitoring of plant status. The experiments were performed on a potted 14-years-old plant, using a general purpose THz emitter receiver head. Trunk THz time-domain reflection signal proved to be very sensitive to changes in plant water availability, as its pattern follows the trend of soil water content and trunk growth variations. Therefore, it could be used to contactless monitor plant water status. Apart from that, THz reflection signal was observed to respond to light conditions which, according to a specifically designed girdling experiment, was caused by changes in the phloem. This latter results opens a promising field of research for contactless monitoring of phloem activity.


Title #1057: Does plant immunity play a critical role during initiation of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis?
PMID: 26082790
Authors: Katalin K. TÃ³th, Gary G. Stacey
Abstract: Plants are exposed to many different microbes in their habitats. These microbes may be benign or pathogenic, but in some cases they are beneficial for the host. The rhizosphere provides an especially rich palette for colonization by beneficial (associative and symbiotic) microorganisms, which raises the question as to how roots can distinguish such 'friends' from possible 'foes' (i.e., pathogens). Plants possess an innate immune system that can recognize pathogens, through an arsenal of protein receptors, including receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like proteins (RLPs) located at the plasma membrane. In addition, the plant host has intracellular receptors (so called NBS-LRR proteins or R proteins) that directly or indirectly recognize molecules released by microbes into the plant cell. A successful cooperation between legume plants and rhizobia leads to beneficial symbiotic interaction. The key rhizobial, symbiotic signaling molecules [lipo-chitooligosaccharide Nod factors (NF)] are perceived by the host legume plant using lysin motif-domain containing RLKs. Perception of the symbiotic NFs trigger signaling cascades leading to bacterial infection and accommodation of the symbiont in a newly formed root organ, the nodule, resulting in a nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. The net result of this symbiosis is the intracellular colonization of the plant with thousands of bacteria; a process that seems to occur in spite of the immune ability of plants to prevent pathogen infection. In this review, we discuss the potential of the invading rhizobial symbiont to actively avoid this innate immune response, as well as specific examples of where the plant immune response may modulate rhizobial infection and host range.


Title #1058: Methods to isolate a large amount of generative cells, sperm cells and vegetative nuclei from tomato pollen for "omics" analysis.
PMID: 26082789
Authors: Yunlong Y. Lu, Liqin L. Wei, Tai T. Wang
Abstract: The development of sperm cells (SCs) from microspores involves a set of finely regulated molecular and cellular events and the coordination of these events. The mechanisms underlying these events and their interconnections remain a major challenge. Systems analysis of genome-wide molecular networks and functional modules with high-throughput "omics" approaches is crucial for understanding the mechanisms; however, this study is hindered because of the difficulty in isolating a large amount of cells of different types, especially generative cells (GCs), from the pollen. Here, we optimized the conditions of tomato pollen germination and pollen tube growth to allow for long-term growth of pollen tubes in vitro with SCs generated in the tube. Using this culture system, we developed methods for isolating GCs, SCs and vegetative cell nuclei (VN) from just-germinated tomato pollen grains and growing pollen tubes and their purification by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The purity and viability of isolated GCs and SCs were confirmed by microscopy examination and fluorescein diacetate staining, respectively, and the integrity of VN was confirmed by propidium iodide staining. We could obtain about 1.5 million GCs and 2.0 million SCs each from 180 mg initiated pollen grains, and 10 million VN from 270 mg initiated pollen grains germinated in vitro in each experiment. These methods provide the necessary preconditions for systematic biology studies of SC development and differentiation in higher plants.


Title #1059: Measuring information flow in cellular networks by the systems biology method through microarray data.
PMID: 26082788
Authors: Bor-Sen BS. Chen, Cheng-Wei CW. Li
Abstract: In general, it is very difficult to measure the information flow in a cellular network directly. In this study, based on an information flow model and microarray data, we measured the information flow in cellular networks indirectly by using a systems biology method. First, we used a recursive least square parameter estimation algorithm to identify the system parameters of coupling signal transduction pathways and the cellular gene regulatory network (GRN). Then, based on the identified parameters and systems theory, we estimated the signal transductivities of the coupling signal transduction pathways from the extracellular signals to each downstream protein and the information transductivities of the GRN between transcription factors in response to environmental events. According to the proposed method, the information flow, which is characterized by signal transductivity in coupling signaling pathways and information transductivity in the GRN, can be estimated by microarray temporal data or microarray sample data. It can also be estimated by other high-throughput data such as next-generation sequencing or proteomic data. Finally, the information flows of the signal transduction pathways and the GRN in leukemia cancer cells and non-leukemia normal cells were also measured to analyze the systematic dysfunction in this cancer from microarray sample data. The results show that the signal transductivities of signal transduction pathways change substantially from normal cells to leukemia cancer cells.


Title #1060: Expression of wild-type PtrIAA14.1, a poplar Aux/IAA gene causes morphological changes in Arabidopsis.
PMID: 26082787
Authors: Shanda S. Liu, Qingnan Q. Hu, Sha S. Luo, Qianqian Q. Li, Xiyu X. Yang, Xianling X. Wang, Shucai S. Wang
Abstract: Aux/IAA proteins are transcriptional repressors that control auxin signaling by interacting with auxin response factors (ARFs). So far all of the identified Aux/IAA mutants with auxin-related phenotypes in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) are dominant gain-of-function mutants, with mutations in Domain II that affected stability of the corresponding Aux/IAA proteins. On the other hand, morphological changes were observed in knock-down mutants of Aux/IAA genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), suggesting that functions of Aux/IAA proteins may be specific for certain plant species. We report here the characterization of PtrIAA14.1, a poplar (Populus trichocarpa) homolog of IAA7. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PtrIAA14.1 is a classic Aux/IAA protein. It contains four conserved domains with the repressor motif in Domain I, the degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV. Protoplast transfection assays showed that PtrIAA14.1 is localized in nucleus. It is unable in the presence of auxin, and it represses auxin response reporter gene expression. Expression of wild-type PtrIAA14.1 in Arabidopsis resulted in auxin-related phenotypes including down-curling leaves, semi-draft with increased number of branches, and greatly reduced fertility, but expression of the Arabidopsis Aux/IAA genes tested remain largely unchanged in the transgenic plants. Protein-protein interaction assays in yeast and protoplasts showed that PtrIAA14.1 interacted with ARF5, but not other ARFs. Consistent with this observation, vascular patterning was altered in the transgenic plants, and the expression of AtHB8 (Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene 8) was reduced in transgenic plants.


Title #1061: Pool size measurements facilitate the determination of fluxes at branching points in non-stationary metabolic flux analysis: the case of Arabidopsis thaliana.
PMID: 26082786
Authors: Robert R. Heise, Alisdair R AR. Fernie, Mark M. Stitt, Zoran Z. Nikoloski
Abstract: Pool size measurements are important for the estimation of absolute intracellular fluxes in particular scenarios based on data from heavy carbon isotope experiments. Recently, steady-state fluxes estimates were obtained for central carbon metabolism in an intact illuminated rosette of Arabidopsis thaliana grown photoautotrophically (Szecowka et al., 2013; Heise et al., 2014). Fluxes were estimated therein by integrating mass-spectrometric data of the dynamics of the unlabeled metabolic fraction, data on metabolic pool sizes, partitioning of metabolic pools between cellular compartments and estimates of photosynthetically inactive pools, with a simplified model of plant central carbon metabolism. However, the fluxes were determined by treating the pool sizes as fixed parameters. Here we investigated whether and, if so, to what extent the treatment of pool sizes as parameters to be optimized in three scenarios may affect the flux estimates. The results are discussed in terms of benchmark values for canonical pathways and reactions, including starch and sucrose synthesis as well as the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation and oxygenation reactions. In addition, we discuss pathways emerging from a divergent branch point for which pool sizes are required for flux estimation, irrespective of the computational approach used for the simulation of the observable labeling pattern. Therefore, our findings indicate the necessity for development of techniques for accurate pool size measurements to improve the quality of flux estimates from non-stationary flux estimates in intact plant cells in the absence of alternative flux measurements.


Title #1062: Kinetin modulates physio-hormonal attributes and isoflavone contents of Soybean grown under salinity stress.
PMID: 26082785

Abstract: Crop productivity continues to decline due to a wide array of biotic and abiotic stresses. Salinity is one of the worst abiotic stresses, as it causes huge losses to crop yield each year. Kinetin (Kn) has been reported as plant growth regulator since long, but its role in improving plant growth and food quality under saline conditions through mediating phytohormonal cross-talk is poorly studied. Current study was designed to evaluate the impact of exogenously applied Kn on growth, isoflovones and endogenous phytohormones of soybean grown under NaCl induced salt stress. Soybean plants were grown in perlite (semi hydroponic), and under controlled green-house conditions. Elevated levels of exogenous Kn significantly mitigated the adverse effect of NaCl and rescued plant growth attributes, i.e., plant height, fresh and dry biomass of soybean plants grown in all treatments. Higher diadzen, glycitin, and genistin contents were observed in plants treated with elevated Kn in the presence or absence of NaCl induce salt stress. The gibberellins (GAs) biosynthesis pathway was up-regulated by Kn as the bioactive GA1 and GA4 contents were significantly higher in Kn treated plants, as compared to control, while GAs level reduced in NaCl treated plants. Contrary to GAs, the abscisic acid contents declined with Kn but promoted in NaCl stressed soybean plants. The endogenous jasmonic acid and salicylic acid contents of soybean enhanced with elevated Kn application, but they showed an antagonistic response under salt stress. Current study supports the active role of Kn to ameliorate the adverse effects of salt stress on the growth and food quality of soybean. The favorable role of Kn toward soybean growth under salt stress may be attributed to its potential to modulate cross-talk between the various phytohormones involved in soybean growth and its resistance to salinity stress.

Abstract: The extracellular space between cell wall and plasma membrane acts as the first battle field between plants and pathogens. Bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes that colonize the living plant tissues are encased in this narrow region in the initial step of infection. Therefore, the apoplastic region is believed to be an interface which mediates the first crosstalk between host and pathogen. The secreted proteins and other metabolites, derived from both host and pathogen, interact in this apoplastic region and govern the final relationship between them. Hence, investigation of protein secretion and apoplastic interaction could provide a better understanding of plant-microbe interaction. Here, we are briefly discussing the methods available for the isolation and normalization of the apoplastic proteins, as well as the current state of secretome studies focused on the in-planta interaction between the host and the pathogen.

Abstract: In a phase I clinical trial, a H5N1 pandemic live attenuated influenza virus (pLAIV) VN2004 vaccine bearing avian influenza H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes on the A/Ann Arbor cold-adapted vaccine backbone displayed very restricted replication. We evaluated T cell responses to H5N1 pLAIV vaccination and assessed pre-existing T cell responses to determine whether they were associated with restricted replication of the H5N1 pLAIV.

Abstract: Schistosomiasis remains a major cause of morbidity in the world. The challenge today is not so much in the clinical management of individual patients, but rather in population-based control of transmission in endemic areas. Despite recent large-scale efforts, such as integrated control programs aimed at limiting schistosomiasis by improving education and sanitation, molluscicide treatment programs and chemotherapy with praziquantel, there has only been limited success. There is an urgent need for complementary approaches, such as vaccines. We demonstrated previously that anti-oxidant enzymes, such as Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S peroxidase (GPX), when administered as DNA-based vaccines induced significant levels of protection in inbred mice, greater than the target 40% reduction in worm burden compared to controls set as a minimum by the WHO. These results led us to investigate if immunization of non-human primates with antioxidants would stimulate an immune response that could confer protection as a prelude study for human trials. Issues of vaccine toxicity and safety that were difficult to address in mice were also investigated. All baboons in the study were examined clinically throughout the study and no adverse reactions occurred to the immunization. When our outbred baboons were vaccinated with two different formulations of SOD (SmCT-SOD and SmEC-SOD) or one of GPX (SmGPX), they showed a reduction in worm number to varying degrees, when compared with the control group. More pronounced, vaccinated animals showed decreased bloody diarrhea, days of diarrhea, and egg excretion (transmission), as well as reduction of eggs in the liver tissue and in the large intestine (pathology) compared to controls. Specific IgG antibodies were present in sera after immunizations and 10 weeks after challenge infection compared to controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mesenteric, and inguinal node cells from vaccinated animals proliferated and produced high levels of cytokines and chemokines in response to crude and recombinant antigens compared with controls. All together, these data demonstrate the potential of antioxidants as a vaccine in a non-human primate model.


Title #1067: Rationale for a Multimodality Strategy to Enhance the Efficacy of Dendritic Cell-Based Cancer Immunotherapy.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DC), master antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate interactions between the adaptive and innate immune arms, are increasingly utilized in cancer immunotherapy. Despite remarkable progress in our understanding of DC immunobiology, as well as several encouraging clinical applications - such as DC-based sipuleucel-T for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer - clinically effective DC-based immunotherapy as monotherapy for a majority of tumors remains a distant goal. The complex interplay between diverse molecular and immune processes that govern resistance to DC-based vaccination compels a multimodality approach, encompassing a growing arsenal of antitumor agents which target these distinct processes and synergistically enhance DC function. These include antibody-based targeted molecular therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, therapies that inhibit immunosuppressive cellular elements, conventional cytotoxic modalities, and immune potentiating adjuvants. It is likely that in the emerging era of "precision" cancer therapeutics, tangible clinical benefits will only be realized with a multifaceted - and personalized - approach combining DC-based vaccination with adjunctive strategies.


Title #1068: Complement System Part I - Molecular Mechanisms of Activation and Regulation.
PMID: 26082779
Authors: Nicolas S NS. Merle, Sarah Elizabeth SE. Church, Veronique V. Fremeaux-Bacchi, Lubka T LT. Roumenina
Abstract: Complement is a complex innate immune surveillance system, playing a key role in defense against pathogens and in host homeostasis. The complement system is initiated by conformational changes in recognition molecular complexes upon sensing danger signals. The subsequent cascade of enzymatic reactions is tightly regulated to assure that complement is activated only at specific locations requiring defense against pathogens, thus avoiding host tissue damage. Here, we discuss the recent advances describing the molecular and structural basis of activation and regulation of the complement pathways and their implication on physiology and pathology. This article will review the mechanisms of activation of alternative, classical, and lectin pathways, the formation of C3 and C5 convertases, the action of anaphylatoxins, and the membrane-attack-complex. We will also discuss the importance of structure-function relationships using the example of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Lastly, we will discuss the development and benefits of therapies using complement inhibitors.


Title #1069: The Content and Size of Hyaluronan in Biological Fluids and Tissues.
PMID: 26082778
Authors: Mary K MK. Cowman, Hong-Gee HG. Lee, Kathryn L KL. Schwertfeger, James B JB. McCarthy, Eva A EA. Turley
Abstract: Hyaluronan is a simple repeating disaccharide polymer, synthesized at the cell surface by integral membrane synthases. The repeating sequence is perfectly homogeneous, and is the same in all vertebrate tissues and fluids. The polymer molecular mass is more variable. Most commonly, hyaluronan is synthesized as a high-molecular mass polymer, with an average molecular mass of approximately 1000-8000âkDa. There are a number of studies showing increased hyaluronan content, but reduced average molecular mass with a broader range of sizes present, in tissues or fluids when inflammatory or tissue-remodeling processes occur. In parallel studies, exogenous hyaluronan fragments of low-molecular mass (generally, <200âkDa) have been shown to affect cell behavior through binding to receptor proteins such as CD44 and RHAMM (gene name HMMR), and to signal either directly or indirectly through toll-like receptors. These data suggest that receptor sensitivity to hyaluronan size provides a biosensor of the state of the microenvironment surrounding the cell. Sensitive methods for isolation and characterization of hyaluronan and its fragments have been developed and continue to improve. This review provides an overview of the methods and our current state of knowledge of hyaluronan content and size distribution in biological fluids and tissues.


Title #1070: Investigating Evolutionary Conservation of Dendritic Cell Subset Identity and Functions.
PMID: 26082777

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) were initially defined as mononuclear phagocytes with a dendritic morphology and an exquisite efficiency for naÃ¯ve T-cell activation. DC encompass several subsets initially identified by their expression of specific cell surface molecules and later shown to excel in distinct functions and to develop under the instruction of different transcription factors or cytokines. Very few cell surface molecules are expressed in a specific manner on any immune cell type. Hence, to identify cell types, the sole use of a small number of cell surface markers in classical flow cytometry can be deceiving. Moreover, the markers currently used to define mononuclear phagocyte subsets vary depending on the tissue and animal species studied and even between laboratories. This has led to confusion in the definition of DC subset identity and in their attribution of specific functions. There is a strong need to identify a rigorous and consensus way to define mononuclear phagocyte subsets, with precise guidelines potentially applicable throughout tissues and species. We will discuss the advantages, drawbacks, and complementarities of different methodologies: cell surface phenotyping, ontogeny, functional characterization, and molecular profiling. We will advocate that gene expression profiling is a very rigorous, largely unbiased and accessible method to define the identity of mononuclear phagocyte subsets, which strengthens and refines surface phenotyping. It is uniquely powerful to yield new, experimentally testable, hypotheses on the ontogeny or functions of mononuclear phagocyte subsets, their molecular regulation, and their evolutionary conservation. We propose defining cell populations based on a combination of cell surface phenotyping, expression analysis of hallmark genes, and robust functional assays, in order to reach a consensus and integrate faster the huge but scattered knowledge accumulated by different laboratories on different cell types, organs, and species.


Title #1071: Impaired T-Cell Function in B-Cell Lymphoma: A Direct Consequence of Events at the Immunological Synapse?
PMID: 26082776
Authors: Marian M. Nassef Kadry Naguib Roufaiel, James W JW. Wells, Raymond J RJ. Steptoe
Abstract: Tumors can escape immune destruction through the development of antigen loss variants and loss of antigen processing/presentation pathways, thereby rendering them invisible to T cells. Alternatively, mechanisms of peripheral T-cell tolerance that would normally be important for protection from the development of autoimmunity may also be co-opted to (i) generate an immuno-inhibitory tumor environment, (ii) promote development of regulatory cell populations, or (iii) cell-intrinsically inactivate tumor-specific T cells. Emerging evidence suggests that T-cell function is impaired in hematological malignancies, which may manifest from cognate interactions between T cells and the tumor. The immunological synapse forms the cognate T-cell and antigen-presenting cell interaction and is the site where key signalling events, including those delivered by co-inhibitory receptors, that determine the fate of T cells occur. Here, we review evidence that events at the immune synapse between T cells and malignant B cells and alterations in immune synapse function may contribute to loss of T-cell function in B-cell malignancies.


Title #1072: Guardians of the Gut - Murine Intestinal Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.
PMID: 26082775
Authors: Mor M. Gross, Tomer-Meir TM. Salame, Steffen S. Jung
Abstract: Intestinal mononuclear phagocytes find themselves in a unique environment, most prominently characterized by its constant exposure to commensal microbiota and food antigens. This anatomic setting has resulted in a number of specializations of the intestinal mononuclear phagocyte compartment that collectively contribute the unique steady state immune landscape of the healthy gut, including homeostatic innate lymphoid cells, B, and T cell compartments. As in other organs, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate in addition the immune defense against pathogens, both in lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Here, we will discuss origins and functions of intestinal DCs and macrophages and their respective subsets, focusing largely on the mouse and cells residing in the lamina propria.


Title #1073: Alarmin' Immunologists: IL-33 as a Putative Target for Modulating T Cell-Dependent Responses.
PMID: 26082774
Authors: Tania T. Gajardo Carrasco, Rodrigo A RA. Morales, Francisco F. PÃ©rez, Claudia C. Terraza, Luz L. YÃ¡Ã±ez, Mauricio M. Campos-Mora, Karina K. Pino-Lagos
Abstract: IL-33 is a known member of the IL-1 cytokine superfamily classically named "atypical" due to its diverse functions. The receptor for this cytokine is the ST2 chain (or IL-1RL1), part of the IL-1R family, and the accessory chain IL-1R. ST2 can be found as both soluble and membrane-bound forms, property that explains, at least in part, its wide range of functions. IL-33 has increasingly gained our attention as a potential target to modulate immune responses. At the beginning, it was known as one of the participants during the development of allergic states and other Th2-mediated responses and it is now accepted that IL-33 contributes to Th1-driven pathologies as demonstrated in animal models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), collagen-induced arthritis, and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced experimental colitis, among others. Interestingly, current data are placing IL-33 as a novel regulator of immune tolerance by affecting regulatory T cells (Tregs); although the mechanism is not fully understood, it seems that dendritic cells and myeloid suppressor-derived cells may be cooperating in the generation and/or establishment of IL-33-mediated tolerance. Here, we review the most updated literature on IL-33, its role on T cell biology, and its impact in immune tolerance.


Title #1074: First Trimester Pregnancy Loss and the Expression of Alternatively Spliced NKp30 Isoforms in Maternal Blood and Placental Tissue.

Abstract: Capsule: We observed that first trimester pregnancy loss is associated with an altered expression profile of the three isoforms of the NK receptor NKp30 expressed by NKs in PBMC and placental tissue. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether first trimester pregnancy loss is associated with differences in expression of NKp30 splice variants (isoforms) in maternal peripheral blood or placental tissue. We conducted a prospective case-control study; a total of 33 women undergoing dilation and curettage due to first trimester pregnancy loss were further subdivided into groups with sporadic or recurrent pregnancy loss. The control group comprises women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. The qPCR approach was employed to assess the relative expression of NKp30 isoforms as well as the total expression of NKp30 and NKp46 receptors between the selected groups. Results show that in both PBMC and placental tissue, NKp46 and NKp30 expressions were mildly elevated in the pregnancy loss groups compared with the elective group. In particular, NKp46 elevation was significant. Moreover, expression analysis of NKp30 isoforms manifested a different profile between PBMC and the placenta. NKp30-a and NKp30-b isoforms in the placental tissue, but not in PBMC, showed a significant increase in the pregnancy loss groups compared with the elective group. Placental expression of NKp30 activating isoforms-a and -b in the pregnancy loss groups was negatively correlated with PLGF expression. By contrast, placental expression of these isoforms in the elective group was positively correlated with TNFÎ±, IL-10, and VEGF-A expression. The altered expression of NKp30 activating isoforms in placental tissue from patients with pregnancy loss compared to the elective group and the different correlations with cytokine expression point to the involvement of NKp30-mediated function in pregnancy loss.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious autoimmune demyelinating disease leading to loss of neurological function. The design and synthesis of various altered peptide ligands of immunodominant epitopes of myelin proteins to alter the autoimmune response, is a promising therapeutic approach for MS. In this study, linear and cyclic peptide analogs based on the myelin basic protein 83-99 (MBP83-99) immunodominant epitope conjugated to reduced mannan via the (KG)5 and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) bridge, respectively, were evaluated for their biological/immunological profiles in SJL/J mice. Of all the peptide analogs tested, linear MBP83-99(F(91)) and linear MBP83-99(Y(91)) conjugated to reduced mannan via a (KG)5 linker and cyclic MBP83-99(F(91)) conjugated to reduce mannan via KLH linker, yielded the best immunological profile and constitute novel candidates for further immunotherapeutic studies against MS in animal models and in human clinical trials.


Title #1076: A subset of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells expresses CD8Î± upon exposure to herpes simplex virus type 1.
PMID: 26082771
Authors: Philipp P. Schuster, Sabrina S. Thomann, Maren M. Werner, JÃ¶rg J. Vollmer, Barbara B. Schmidt
Abstract: Classical and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) play important roles in the defense against murine and human infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV). So far, CD8Î± expression has only been reported for murine DC. CD8Î±(+) DC have prominent cross-presenting activities, which are enhanced by murine CD8Î±(+) PDC. The human orthologue of murine CD8Î±(+) DC, the CD141 (BDCA3)(+) DC, mainly cross-present after TLR3 ligation. We report here the serendipitous finding that a subset of human PDC upregulates CD8Î± upon HSV-1 stimulation, as shown by gene array and flow cytometry analyses. CD8Î±, not CD8Ã, was expressed upon exposure. Markers of activation, migration, and costimulation were upregulated on CD8Î±-expressing human PDC. In these cells, increased cytokine and chemokine levels were detected that enhance development and function of T, B, and NK cells, and recruit immature DC, monocytes, and Th1 cells, respectively. Altogether, human CD8Î±(+) PDC exhibit a highly activated phenotype and appear to recruit other immune cells to the site of inflammation. Further studies will show whether CD8Î±-expressing PDC contribute to antigen cross-presentation, which may be important for immune defenses against HSV infections in vitro and in vivo.


Title #1077: Rhodopsin gene expression regulated by the light dark cycle, light spectrum and light intensity in the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum.
PMID: 26082770
Authors: Xinguo X. Shi, Ling L. Li, Chentao C. Guo, Xin X. Lin, Meizhen M. Li, Senjie S. Lin
Abstract: The proton pump rhodopsin is widely found in marine bacteria and archaea, where it functions to capture light energy and convert it to ATP. While found in several lineages of dinoflagellates, this gene has not been studied in Prorocentrales species and whether it functionally tunes to light spectra and intensities as in bacteria remains unclear. Here we identified and characterized this gene in the bloom-forming Prorocentrum donghaiense. It is a 7-helix transmembrane polypeptide containing conserved domains and critical amino acid residues of PPR. This gene is phylogenetically affiliated to the xanthorhodopsin clade, but seems to have a distinct evolutionary origin. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that in regular cultures, the transcript abundance of the gene exhibited a clear diel pattern, high abundance in the light period and low in the dark. The same diel pattern was observed for protein abundance with a Western blot using specific antiserum. The rhythm was dampened when the cultures were shifted to continuous dark or light condition, suggesting that this gene is not under circadian clock control. Rhodopsin transcript and protein abundances varied with light intensity, both being highest at a moderate illumination level. Furthermore, the expression of this gene responded to different light spectra, with slightly higher transcript abundance under green than blue light, and lowest abundance under red light. Transformed Escherichia coli over-expressing this rhodopsin gene also exhibited an absorption maximum in the blue-green region with slightly higher absorption in the green. These rhodopsin-promoting light conditions are similar to the relatively turbid marine habitat where the species forms blooms, suggesting that this gene may function to compensate for the light-limited photosynthesis in the dim environment.


Title #1078: Nucleocytoplasmic transport of nucleocapsid proteins of enveloped RNA viruses.
PMID: 26082769
Authors: Wahyu N WN. Wulan, Deborah D. Heydet, Erin J EJ. Walker, Michelle E ME. Gahan, Reena R. Ghildyal
Abstract: Most viruses with non-segmented single stranded RNA genomes complete their life cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells. However, despite undergoing replication in the cytoplasm, the structural proteins of some of these RNA viruses localize to the nucleus at specific times in the virus life cycle, primarily early in infection. Limited evidence suggests that this enhances successful viral replication by interfering with or inhibiting the host antiviral response. Nucleocapsid proteins of RNA viruses have a well-established, essential cytoplasmic role in virus replication and assembly. Intriguingly, nucleocapsid proteins of some RNA viruses also localize to the nucleus/nucleolus of infected cells. Their nuclear function is less well understood although significant advances have been made in recent years. This review will focus on the nucleocapsid protein of cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses, including their localization to the nucleus/nucleolus and function therein. A greater understanding of the nuclear localization of nucleocapsid proteins has the potential to enhance therapeutic strategies as it can be a target for the development of live-attenuated vaccines or antiviral drugs.


Title #1079: New metabolic pathway for degradation of 2-nitrobenzoate by Arthrobacter sp. SPG.
PMID: 26082768
Authors: Pankaj K PK. Arora, Ashutosh A. Sharma
Abstract: Arthrobacter sp. SPG utilized 2-nitrobenzoate as its sole source of carbon and energy and degraded it with accumulation of stoichiometric amounts of nitrite ions. Salicylate and catechol were detected as metabolites of the 2-nitrobenzoate degradation using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enzyme activities for 2-nitrobenzoate-2-monooxygenase, salicylate hydroxylase, and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase were detected in the crude extracts of the 2-nitrobenzoate-induced cells of strain SPG. The 2-nitrobenzoate-monooxygenase activity resulted in formation of salicylate and nitrite from 2-nitrobenzoate, whereas salicylate hydroxylase catalyzed the conversion of salicylate to catechol. The ring-cleaving enzyme, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase cleaved catechol to cis,cis-muconic acid. Cells of strain SPG were able to degrade 2-nitrobenzoate in sterile as well as non-sterile soil microcosms. The results of microcosm studies showed that strain SPG degraded more than 90% of 2-nitrobenzoate within 10-12 days. This study clearly shows that Arthrobacter sp. SPG degraded 2-nitrobenzoate via a new pathway with formation of salicylate and catechol as metabolites. Arthrobacter sp. SPG may be used for bioremediation of 2-nitrobenzoate-contaminated sites due to its ability to degrade 2-nitrobenzoate in soil.


Title #1080: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cytochrome P450 in HIV pathogenesis.
PMID: 26082767
Authors: P S S PS. Rao, Santosh S. Kumar
Abstract: High prevalence of cigarette smoking in HIV patients is associated with increased HIV pathogenesis and disease progression. While the effect of smoking on the occurrence of lung cancer has been studied extensively, the association between smoking and HIV pathogenesis is poorly studied. We have recently shown the possible role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in smoking/nicotine-mediated viral replication. In this review, we focus on the potential role of CYP pathway in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), important constituents of cigarette smoke, mediated HIV pathogenesis. More specifically, we will discuss the role of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which are the major PAH-activating CYP enzymes. Our results have shown that treatment with cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) increases viral replication in HIV-infected macrophages. CSC contains PAH, which are known to be activated by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 into procarcinogens/toxic metabolites. The expression of these CYPs is regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), the cellular target of PAH, and an important player in various diseases including cancer. We propose that PAH/AHR-mediated CYP pathway is a novel target to develop new interventions for HIV positive smokers.


Title #1081: Standard filtration practices may significantly distort planktonic microbial diversity estimates.

Abstract: Fractionation of biomass by filtration is a standard method for sampling planktonic microbes. It is unclear how the taxonomic composition of filtered biomass changes depending on sample volume. Using seawater from a marine oxygen minimum zone, we quantified the 16S rRNA gene composition of biomass on a prefilter (1.6 Î¼m pore-size) and a downstream 0.2 Î¼m filter over sample volumes from 0.05 to 5 L. Significant community shifts occurred in both filter fractions, and were most dramatic in the prefilter community. Sequences matching Vibrionales decreased from ~40 to 60% of prefilter datasets at low volumes (0.05-0.5 L) to less than 5% at higher volumes, while groups such at the Chromatiales and Thiohalorhabdales followed opposite trends, increasing from minor representation to become the dominant taxa at higher volumes. Groups often associated with marine particles, including members of the Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes, were among those showing the greatest increase with volume (4 to 27-fold). Taxon richness (97% similarity clusters) also varied significantly with volume, and in opposing directions depending on filter fraction, highlighting potential biases in community complexity estimates. These data raise concerns for studies using filter fractionation for quantitative comparisons of aquatic microbial diversity, for example between free-living and particle-associated communities.


Title #1082: The orisome: structure and function.
PMID: 26082765
Authors: Alan C AC. Leonard, Julia E JE. Grimwade
Abstract: During the cell division cycle of all bacteria, DNA-protein complexes termed orisomes trigger the onset of chromosome duplication. Orisome assembly is both staged and stringently regulated to ensure that DNA synthesis begins at a precise time and only once at each origin per cycle. Orisomes comprise multiple copies of the initiator protein DnaA, which oligomerizes after interacting with specifically positioned recognition sites in the unique chromosomal replication origin, oriC. Since DnaA is highly conserved, it is logical to expect that all bacterial orisomes will share fundamental attributes. Indeed, although mechanistic details remain to be determined, all bacterial orisomes are capable of unwinding oriC DNA and assisting with loading of DNA helicase onto the single-strands. However, comparative analysis of oriCs reveals that the arrangement and number of DnaA recognition sites is surprisingly variable among bacterial types, suggesting there are many paths to produce functional orisome complexes. Fundamental questions exist about why these different paths exist and which features of orisomes must be shared among diverse bacterial types. In this review we present the current understanding of orisome assembly and function in Escherichia coli and compare the replication origins among the related members of the Gammaproteobacteria. From this information we propose that the diversity in orisome assembly reflects both the requirement to regulate the conformation of origin DNA as well as to provide an appropriate cell cycle timing mechanism that reflects the lifestyle of the bacteria. We suggest that identification of shared steps in orisome assembly may reveal particularly good targets for new antibiotics.


Title #1083: The FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Giardia duodenalis: an unconventional enzyme that interacts with the g14-3-3 and it is a target of the antitumoral compound NBDHEX.

Abstract: The flagellated protozoan Giardia duodenalis is a worldwide parasite causing giardiasis, an acute and chronic diarrheal disease. Metabolism in G. duodenalis has a limited complexity thus making metabolic enzymes ideal targets for drug development. However, only few metabolic pathways (i.e., carbohydrates) have been described so far. Recently, the parasite homolog of the mitochondrial-like glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gG3PD) has been identified among the interactors of the g14-3-3 protein. G3PD is involved in glycolysis, electron transport, glycerophospholipids metabolism, and hyperosmotic stress response, and is emerging as promising target in tumor treatment. In this work, we demonstrate that gG3PD is a functional flavoenzyme able to convert glycerol-3-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and that its activity and the intracellular glycerol level increase during encystation. Taking advantage of co-immunoprecipitation assays and deletion mutants, we provide evidence that gG3PD and g14-3-3 interact at the trophozoite stage, the intracellular localization of gG3PD is stage dependent and it partially co-localizes with mitosomes during cyst development. Finally, we demonstrate that the gG3PD activity is affected by the antitumoral compound 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol, that results more effective in vitro at killing G. duodenalis trophozoites than the reference drug metronidazole. Overall, our results highlight the involvement of gG3PD in processes crucial for the parasite survival thus proposing this enzyme as target for novel antigiardial interventions.


Title #1084: Seasonal variation in denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia process rates and corresponding key functional genes along an estuarine nitrate gradient.
PMID: 26082763
Authors: Cindy J CJ. Smith, Liang F LF. Dong, John J. Wilson, Andrew A. Stott, A Mark AM. Osborn, David B DB. Nedwell
Abstract: This research investigated spatial-temporal variation in benthic bacterial community structure, rates of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) processes and abundances of corresponding genes and transcripts at three sites-the estuary-head, mid-estuary and the estuary mouth (EM) along the nitrate gradient of the Colne estuary over an annual cycle. Denitrification rates declined down the estuary, while DNRA rates were higher at the estuary head and middle than the EM. In four out of the six 2-monthly time-points, rates of DNRA were greater than denitrification at each site. Abundance of gene markers for nitrate-reduction (nitrate reductase narG and napA), denitrification (nitrite reductase nirS) and DNRA (DNRA nitrite reductase nrfA) declined along the estuary with significant relationships between denitrification and nirS abundance, and DNRA and nrfA abundance. Spatially, rates of denitrification, DNRA and corresponding functional gene abundances decreased along the estuary. However, temporal correlations between rate processes and functional gene and transcript abundances were not observed.


Title #1085: Catch me if you can: a biotinylated proteoliposome affinity assay for the investigation of assembly of the MexA-MexB-OprM efflux pump from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
PMID: 26082762
Authors: VÃ©ronique Yvette VY. Ntsogo EnguÃ©nÃ©, Alice A. VerchÃ¨re, Gilles G. Phan, Isabelle I. Broutin, Martin M. Picard
Abstract: Efflux pumps are membrane transporters that actively extrude various substrates, leading to multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we have designed a new test that allows investigating the assembly of the MexA-MexB-OprM efflux pump from the Gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The method relies on the streptavidin-mediated pull-down of OprM proteoliposomes upon interaction with MexAB proteoliposomes containing a biotin function carried by lipids. We give clear evidence for the importance of MexA in promoting and stabilizing the assembly of the MexAB-OprM complex. In addition, we have investigated the effect of the role of the lipid anchor of MexA as well as the role of the proton motive force on the assembly and disassembly of the efflux pump. The assay presented here allows for an accurate investigation of the assembly with only tens of microgram of protein and could be adapted to 96 wells plates. Hence, this work provides a basis for the medium-high screening of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs).

Abstract: The complexity of giant virus genomes is intriguing, especially the presence of genes encoding components of the protein translation machinery such as transfer RNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases; these features are uncommon among other viruses. Although orthologs of these genes are codified by their hosts, one can hypothesize that having these translation-related genes might represent a gain of fitness during infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of translation-related genes by mimivirus during infection of Acanthamoeba castellanii under different nutritional conditions. In silico analysis of amino acid usage revealed remarkable differences between the mimivirus isolates and the A. castellanii host. Relative expression analysis by quantitative PCR revealed that mimivirus was able to modulate the expression of eight viral translation-related genes according to the amoebal growth condition, with a higher induction of gene expression under starvation. Some mimivirus isolates presented differences in translation-related gene expression; notably, polymorphisms in the promoter regions correlated with these differences. Two mimivirus isolates did not encode the tryptophanyl-tRNA in their genomes, which may be linked with low conservation pressure based on amino acid usage analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that mimivirus can modulate the expression of translation-related genes in response to nutrient availability in the host cell, allowing the mimivirus to adapt to different hosts growing under different nutritional conditions.

Abstract: Chicken coccidiosis, caused by Eimeria sp., occurs in almost all poultry farms and causes huge economic losses in the poultry industry. Although this disease could be controlled by vaccination, the reduced feed conservation ratio limits the widespread application of anticoccidial vaccines in broilers because some intermediate and/or low immunogenic Eimeria sp. only elicit partial protection. It is of importance to enhance the immunogenicity of these Eimeria sp. by adjuvants for more effective prevention of coccidiosis. Cytokines have remarkable effects on the immunogenicity of antigens. Interleukin 2 (IL-2), for example, significantly stimulates the activation of CD8+ T cells and other immune cells. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Eimeria mitis line (EmiChIL-2) expressing chicken IL-2 (ChIL-2) to investigate the adjuvant effect of ChIL-2 to enhance the immunogenicity of E. mitis against its infection. Stable transfected EmiChIL-2 population was obtained by pyrimethamine selection and verified by PCR, genome walking, western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Cellular immune response, E. mitis-specific IFN-Î³ secretion lymphocytes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stimulated by EmiChIL-2 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). The results showed that EmiChIL-2 stimulated a higher cellular immune response compared with that of the wild-type parasite infection in chickens. Moreover, after the immunization with EmiChIL-2, elevated cellular immune response as well as reduced oocyst output were observed These results indicated that ChIL-2 expressed by Eimeria sp. functions as adjuvant and IL-2 expressing Eimeria parasites are valuable vaccine strains against coccidiosis.


Title #1089: Restriction modification systems as engines of diversity.

Authors: Kim K. Sneppen, Szabolcs S. Semsey, Aswin S N AS. Seshasayee, Sandeep S. Krishna
Abstract: Restriction modification (RM) systems provide protection against a broad spectrum of phages. However, the likelihood of a phage permanently bypassing this can be as high as 0.1 per infection (Korona et al., 1993) which makes for a relatively weak defense. Here we argue that, apart from providing such transient defenses, RM systems can facilitate long-term coexistence of many bacterial strains. We show that this diversity can be as large as the burst size of the phage but no larger-a curious correspondence between a number at the level of species and another number at the level of individuals. Such a highly diverse and stably coexisting ecosystem is robust to substantial variation in both bacterial growth rates and strength of their RM systems, which might be one reason why quite weak RM systems exist in the wild.


Title #1090: Endosymbiosis in trypanosomatid protozoa: the bacterium division is controlled during the host cell cycle.

Abstract: Mutualism is defined as a beneficial relationship for the associated partners and usually assumes that the symbiont number is controlled. Some trypanosomatid protozoa co-evolve with a bacterial symbiont that divides in coordination with the host in a way that results in its equal distribution between daughter cells. The mechanism that controls this synchrony is largely unknown, and its comprehension might provide clues to understand how eukaryotic cells evolved when acquiring symbionts that later became organelles. Here, we approached this question by studying the effects of inhibitors that affect the host exclusively in two symbiont-bearing trypanosomatids, Strigomonas culicis and Angomonas deanei. We found that inhibiting host protein synthesis using cycloheximide or host DNA replication using aphidicolin did not affect the duplication of bacterial DNA. Although the bacteria had autonomy to duplicate their DNA when host protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, they could not complete cytokinesis. Aphidicolin promoted the inhibition of the trypanosomatid cell cycle in the G1/S phase, leading to symbiont filamentation in S. culicis but not in A. deanei. Treatment with camptothecin blocked the host protozoa cell cycle in the G2 phase and induced the formation of filamentous symbionts in both species. Oryzalin, which affects host microtubule polymerization, blocked trypanosomatid mitosis and abrogated symbiont division. Our results indicate that host factors produced during the cell division cycle are essential for symbiont segregation and may control the bacterial cell number.


Title #1091: Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein: a potential Treg modulator suppressing allergic asthma?
PMID: 26082756
Authors: Anjna A. Sehrawat, Siddharth S. Sinha, Abhishek A. Saxena
Abstract: The ultimate aim of the immune system is to eliminate pathogens without being harmful to the host. But what if eliminating the pathogen in itself is discomforting for the host? One such emerging case is of Helicobacter pylori. Modern medicine, infantile vaccination, and ultra-hygienic conditions have led to progressive disappearance of H. pylori in different parts of the world. However, the adversities caused by H. pylori's absence are much larger than those caused by its presence. Asthma is rising as an epidemic in last few decades and several reports suggest an inverse-relationship between H. pylori's persistence and early-life onset asthma. Regulatory T cells play an important role in both the cases. This is further supported by experiments on mouse-models. Hence, need of the hour is to discern the relationship between H. pylori and its host and eliminating its negative impacts without disturbing our indigenous microbiota. To resolve whether H. pylori is a pathogen or an amphibiont is another important side. This review explores the biological basis of H. pylori-induced priming of immune system offering resistance to childhood-onset asthma. HP-NAP-Tregs interaction has been predicted using molecular docking and dynamic simulation.


Title #1092: Patients with Active Acromegaly are at High Risk of 25(OH)D Deficiency.
PMID: 26082755
Authors: Jowita J. Halupczok-Å»yÅa, Aleksandra A. Jawiarczyk-PrzybyÅowska, Marek M. Bolanowski
Abstract: Acromegaly is a chronic disease characterized by hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Electrolyte disturbances such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are reported in patients with this disorder. There is limited data on vitamin D status in subjects with acromegaly. The aim of the study was to determine calcium, inorganic phosphate, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and 25(OH)D levels with regard to the activity of the disease. We also studied correlations of 25(OH)D and IGF-1, GH, body mass, body mass index, and age. A study group consisted of 55 acromegalic patients, and was divided into three subgroups: active acromegaly (AA), well-controlled acromegaly (WCA), cured acromegaly (CA). We enrolled 29 healthy subjects to a control group (CG). Vitamin D deficiency was recorded in all AA patients, 13 WCA patients (92.86%), 10 CA patients (62.5%), and 13 controls (54.17%). The highest 25(OH)D levels were found in the CG group and the lowest in the AA group (pâ=â0.012). The dose of octreotide did not influence serum 25(OH)D levels. A significant positive correlation between IGF-1 and 25(OH)D levels was observed in the AA group (râ=â0.58, pâ=â0.024). Inorganic phosphate levels were the highest in the AA group. In conclusion, active acromegalic patients have lower 25(OH)D levels in comparison with the CG and are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency.


Title #1093: Diacylglycerol Lipase Î± Knockout Mice Demonstrate Metabolic and Behavioral Phenotypes Similar to Those of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Knockout Mice.

Abstract: After creating >4,650 knockouts (KOs) of independent mouse genes, we screened them by high-throughput phenotyping and found that cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) KO mice had the same lean phenotype published by others. We asked if our KOs of DAG lipase Î± or Î² (Dagla or Daglb), which catalyze biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid (EC) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), or Napepld, which catalyzes biosynthesis of the EC anandamide, shared the lean phenotype of Cnr1 KO mice. We found that Dagla KO mice, but not Daglb or Napepld KO mice, were among the leanest of 3651 chow-fed KO lines screened. In confirmatory studies, chow- or high fat diet-fed Dagla and Cnr1 KO mice were leaner than wild-type (WT) littermates; when data from multiple cohorts of adult mice were combined, body fat was 47 and 45% lower in Dagla and Cnr1 KO mice, respectively, relative to WT values. By contrast, neither Daglb nor Napepld KO mice were lean. Weanling Dagla KO mice ate less than WT mice and had body weight (BW) similar to pair-fed WT mice, and adult Dagla KO mice had normal activity and VO2 levels, similar to Cnr1 KO mice. Our Dagla and Cnr1 KO mice also had low fasting insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels, and after glucose challenge had normal glucose but very low insulin levels. Dagla and Cnr1 KO mice also showed similar responses to a battery of behavioral tests. These data suggest: (1) the lean phenotype of young Dagla and Cnr1 KO mice is mainly due to hypophagia; (2) in pathways where ECs signal through Cnr1 to regulate food intake and other metabolic and behavioral phenotypes observed in Cnr1 KO mice, Dagla alone provides the 2-AG that serves as the EC signal; and (3) small molecule Dagla inhibitors with a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that of Cnr1 inverse agonists are likely to mirror the ability of these Cnr1 inverse agonists to lower BW and improve glycemic control in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, but may also induce undesirable neuropsychiatric side-effects.


Title #1094: Transmembrane Amyloid-Related Proteins in CSF as Potential Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.

Abstract: In the continuing search for new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), reasonable candidates are the secretase enzymes involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), as well as the large proteolytic cleavage fragments sAPPÎ± and sAPPÎ². The enzymatic activities of some of these secretases, such as BACE1 and TACE, have been investigated as potential AD biomarkers, and it has been assumed that these activities present in human CSF result from the soluble truncated forms of the membrane-bound enzymes. However, we and others recently identified soluble forms of BACE1 and APP in CSF containing the intracellular domains, as well as the multi-pass transmembrane presenilin-1 (PS1) and other subunits of Î³-secretase. We also review recent findings that suggest that most of these soluble transmembrane proteins could display self-association properties based on hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions leading to the formation of heteromeric complexes. The oligomerization state of these potential new biomarkers needs to be taken into consideration for assessing their real potential as CSF biomarkers for AD by adequate molecular tools.


Title #1095: Orexin Receptor Activation Generates Gamma Band Input to Cholinergic and Serotonergic Arousal System Neurons and Drives an Intrinsic Ca(2+)-Dependent Resonance in LDT and PPT Cholinergic Neurons.

Abstract: A hallmark of the waking state is a shift in EEG power to higher frequencies with epochs of synchronized intracortical gamma activity (30-60 Hz) - a process associated with high-level cognitive functions. The ascending arousal system, including cholinergic laterodorsal (LDT) and pedunculopontine (PPT) tegmental neurons and serotonergic dorsal raphe (DR) neurons, promotes this state. Recently, this system has been proposed as a gamma wave generator, in part, because some neurons produce high-threshold, Ca(2+)-dependent oscillations at gamma frequencies. However, it is not known whether arousal-related inputs to these neurons generate such oscillations, or whether such oscillations are ever transmitted to neuronal targets. Since key arousal input arises from hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons, we investigated whether the unusually noisy, depolarizing orexin current could provide significant gamma input to cholinergic and serotonergic neurons, and whether such input could drive Ca(2+)-dependent oscillations. Whole-cell recordings in brain slices were obtained from mice expressing Cre-induced fluorescence in cholinergic LDT and PPT, and serotonergic DR neurons. After first quantifying reporter expression accuracy in cholinergic and serotonergic neurons, we found that the orexin current produced significant high frequency, including gamma, input to both cholinergic and serotonergic neurons. Then, by using a dynamic clamp, we found that adding a noisy orexin conductance to cholinergic neurons induced a Ca(2+)-dependent resonance that peaked in the theta and alpha frequency range (4-14 Hz) and extended up to 100 Hz. We propose that this orexin current noise and the Ca(2+) dependent resonance work synergistically to boost the encoding of high-frequency synaptic inputs into action potentials and to help ensure cholinergic neurons fire during EEG activation. This activity could reinforce thalamocortical states supporting arousal, REM sleep, and intracortical gamma.


Title #1096: Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment, Part 2: Treatment "Roles of Capillary Index Score, Revascularization and Time".
PMID: 26082751
Authors: Firas F. Al-Ali, John J JJ. Elias, Danielle E DE. Filipkowski
Abstract: Due to recent results from clinical intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke (IAT-AIS) trials such as the interventional management of stroke III, IAT-AIS and the merit of revascularization have been contested. Even though intra-arterial treatment (IAT) has been shown to improve revascularization rates, a corresponding increase in good outcomes has only recently been noted. Even though a significant percentage of patients achieve good revascularization in a timely manner, results do not translate into good clinical outcomes (GCOs). Based on a review of the literature, the authors suspect limited GCOs following timely and successful revascularization are due to poor patient selection that led to futile and possibly even harmful revascularization. The capillary index score (CIS) is a simple angiography-based scale that can potentially be used to improve patient selection to prevent revascularization being performed on patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. The CIS characterizes presence of capillary blush related to collateral flow as a marker of residual viable tissue, with absence of blush indicating the tissue is no longer viable due to ischemia. By only selecting patients with a favorable CIS for IAT, the rate of GCOs should consistently approach 80-90%. Current methods of patient selection are primarily dependent on time from ischemia. Time from cerebral ischemia to irreversible tissue damage seems to vary from patient to patient; so focusing on viable tissue based on the CIS rather than relying on an artificial time window seems to be a more appropriate approach to patient selection.


Title #1097: The effect of oral motor activity on the athletic performance of professional golfers.
PMID: 26082747

Abstract: Human motor control is based on complex sensorimotor processes. Recent research has shown that neuromuscular activity of the craniomandibular system (CMS) might affect human motor control. In particular, improvements in postural stability and muscle strength have been observed as a result of voluntary jaw clenching. Potential benefits of jaw aligning appliances on muscle strength and golf performance have also been described. These reports are highly contradictory, however, and the oral motor task performed is often unclear. The purpose of our study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of submaximum biting on golf performance via shot precision and shot length over three different distances. Participants were 14 male professional golfers - seven with sleep bruxism and seven without - randomly performing golf shots over 60m, 160m, or driving distance while either biting on an oral splint or biting on their teeth; habitual jaw position served as the control condition. Statistical analysis revealed that oral motor activity did not systematically affect golf performance in respect of shot precision or shot length for 60m, 160 m, or driving distance. These findings were reinforced by impact variables such as club head speed and ball speed, which were also not indicative of significant effects. The results thus showed that the strength improvements and stabilizing effects described previously are, apparently, not transferable to such coordination-demanding sports as golf. This could be due to the divergent motor demands associated with postural control and muscle strength on the one hand and the complex coordination of a golf swing on the other. Interestingly, subjects without sleep bruxism performed significantly better at the short distance (60 m) than those with bruxism. Because of the multifactorial etiology of parafunctional CMS activity, conclusions about the need for dental treatment to improve sports performance are, however, completely unwarranted.


Title #1098: Brain mechanisms of short-term habituation and sensitization toward dyspnea.
PMID: 26082746
Authors: M Cornelia MC. Stoeckel, Roland W RW. Esser, Matthias M. Gamer, Christian C. BÃ¼chel, Andreas A. von Leupoldt
Abstract: Dyspnea is a prevalent and threatening cardinal symptom in many diseases including asthma. Whether patients suffering from dyspnea show habituation or sensitization toward repeated experiences of dyspnea is relevant for both quality of life and treatment success. Understanding the mechanisms, including the underlying brain activation patterns, that determine the dynamics of dyspnea perception seems crucial for the improvement of treatment and rehabilitation. Toward this aim, we investigated the interplay between short-term changes of dyspnea perception and changes of related brain activation. Healthy individuals underwent repeated blocks of resistive load induced dyspnea with parallel acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Late vs. early ratings on dyspnea intensity and unpleasantness were correlated with late vs. early brain activation for both, dyspnea anticipation and dyspnea perception. Individual trait and state anxiety were determined using questionnaire data. Our results indicate an involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), midbrain/periaqueductal gray (PAG) and anterior insular cortex in habituation/sensitization toward dyspnea. Changes in the anterior insular cortex were particularly linked to changes in dyspnea unpleasantness. Changes of both dyspnea intensity and unpleasantness were positively correlated with state and trait anxiety. Our findings are in line with the suggested relationship between the anterior insular cortex and dyspnea unpleasantness. They further support the notion that habituation/sensitization toward dyspnea is influenced by anxiety. Our study extends the known role of the midbrain/PAG in anti-nociception to an additional involvement in habituation/sensitization toward dyspnea and suggests an interplay with the OFC.


Title #1099: Real-time sampling of reasons for hedonic food consumption: further validation of the Palatable Eating Motives Scale.

Abstract: Highly palatable foods play a salient role in obesity and binge-eating, and if habitually eaten to deal with intrinsic and extrinsic factors unrelated to metabolic need, may compromise adaptive coping and interpersonal skills. This study used event sampling methodology (ESM) to examine whether individuals who report eating palatable foods primarily to cope, to enhance reward, to be social, or to conform, as measured by the Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS), actually eat these foods primarily for the motive(s) they report on the PEMS. Secondly this study examined if the previously reported ability of the PEMS Coping motive to predict BMI would replicate if the real-time (ESM-reported) coping motive was used to predict BMI. A total of 1691 palatable eating events were collected from 169 college students over 4 days. Each event included the day, time, and types of tasty foods or drinks consumed followed by a survey that included an abbreviated version of the PEMS, hunger as an additional possible motive, and a question assessing general perceived stress during the eating event. Two-levels mixed modeling confirmed that ESM-reported motives correlated most strongly with their respective PEMS motives and that all were negatively associated with eating for hunger. While stress surrounding the eating event was strongly associated with the ESM-coping motive, its inclusion in the model as a predictor of this motive did not abolish the significant association between ESM and PEMS Coping scores. Regression models confirmed that scores on the ESM-coping motive predicted BMI. These findings provide ecological validity for the PEMS to identify true-to-life motives for consuming palatable foods. This further adds to the utility of the PEMS in individualizing, and hence improving, treatment strategies for obesity, binge-eating, dietary nutrition, coping, reward acquisition, and psychosocial skills.


Title #1100: Effects of an emotional intelligence program in variables related to the prevention of violence.
PMID: 26082743
Authors: Maite M. Garaigordobil, Ainize A. PeÃ±a-Sarrionandia
Abstract: In recent decades, numerous studies have shown a significant increase in violence during childhood and adolescence. These data suggest the importance of implementing programs to prevent and reduce violent behavior. The study aimed to design a program of emotional intelligence (EI) for adolescents and to assess its effects on variables related to violence prevention. The possible differential effect of the program on both genders was also examined. The sample comprised 148 adolescents aged from 13 to 16 years. The study used an experimental design with repeated pretest-posttest measures and control groups. To measure the variables, four assessment instruments were administered before and after the program, as well as in the follow-up phase (1 year after the conclusion of the intervention). The program consisted of 20 one-hour sessions. The pretest-posttest ANCOVAs showed that the program significantly increased: (1) EI (attention, clarity, emotional repair); (2) assertive cognitive social interaction strategies; (3) internal control of anger; and (4) the cognitive ability to analyze negative feelings. In the follow-up phase, the positive effects of the intervention were generally maintained and, moreover, the use of aggressive strategies as an interpersonal conflict-resolution technique was significantly reduced. Regarding the effect of the program on both genders, the change was very similar, but the boys increased assertive social interaction strategies, attention, and emotional clarity significantly more than the girls. The importance of implementing programs to promote socio-emotional development and prevent violence is discussed.


Title #1101: Metacognition and confidence: comparing math to other academic subjects.
PMID: 26082742
Authors: Shanna S. Erickson, Evan E. Heit
Abstract: Two studies addressed student metacognition in math, measuring confidence accuracy about math performance. Underconfidence would be expected in light of pervasive math anxiety. However, one might alternatively expect overconfidence based on previous results showing overconfidence in other subject domains. Metacognitive judgments and performance were assessed for biology, literature, and mathematics tests. In Study 1, high school students took three different tests and provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test. In Study 2, undergraduates similarly took three shortened SAT II Subject Tests. Students were overconfident in predicting math performance, indeed showing greater overconfidence compared to other academic subjects. It appears that both overconfidence and anxiety can adversely affect metacognitive ability and can lead to math avoidance. The results have implications for educational practice and other environments that require extensive use of math.


Title #1102: Discrimination and well-being amongst the homeless: the role of multiple group membership.
PMID: 26082741
Authors: Melissa M. Johnstone, Jolanda J. Jetten, Genevieve A GA. Dingle, Cameron C. Parsell, Zoe C ZC. Walter
Abstract: The homeless are a vulnerable population in many respects. Those experiencing homelessness not only experience personal and economic hardship they also frequently face discrimination and exclusion because of their housing status. Although past research has shown that identifying with multiple groups can buffer against the negative consequences of discrimination on well-being, it remains to be seen whether such strategies protect well-being of people who are homeless. We investigate this issue in a longitudinal study of 119 individuals who were homeless. The results showed that perceived group-based discrimination at T1 was associated with fewer group memberships, and lower subsequent well-being at T2. There was no relationship between personal discrimination at T1 on multiple group memberships at T2. The findings suggest that the experience of group-based discrimination may hinder connecting with groups in the broader social world - groups that could potentially protect the individual against the negative impact of homelessness and discrimination.


Title #1103: Integrated learning: ways of fostering the applicability of teachers' pedagogical and psychological knowledge.
PMID: 26082740
Authors: Nora N. Harr, Andreas A. Eichler, Alexander A. Renkl
Abstract: In teacher education, general pedagogical and psychological knowledge (PPK) is often taught separately from the teaching subject itself, potentially leading to inert knowledge. In an experimental study with 69 mathematics student teachers, we tested the benefits of fostering the integration of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and general PPK with respect to knowledge application. Integration was fostered either by integrating the contents or by prompting the learners to integrate separately taught knowledge. Fostering integration, as compared to a separate presentation without integration help, led to more applicable PPK and greater simultaneous application of PPK and PCK. The advantages of fostering knowledge integration were not moderated by the student teachers' prior knowledge or working memory capacity. A disadvantage of integrating different knowledge types referred to increased learning times.


Title #1104: Perceived synchrony for realistic and dynamic audiovisual events.
PMID: 26082738
Authors: Ragnhild R. Eg, Dawn M DM. Behne
Abstract: In well-controlled laboratory experiments, researchers have found that humans can perceive delays between auditory and visual signals as short as 20 ms. Conversely, other experiments have shown that humans can tolerate audiovisual asynchrony that exceeds 200 ms. This seeming contradiction in human temporal sensitivity can be attributed to a number of factors such as experimental approaches and precedence of the asynchronous signals, along with the nature, duration, location, complexity and repetitiveness of the audiovisual stimuli, and even individual differences. In order to better understand how temporal integration of audiovisual events occurs in the real world, we need to close the gap between the experimental setting and the complex setting of everyday life. With this work, we aimed to contribute one brick to the bridge that will close this gap. We compared perceived synchrony for long-running and eventful audiovisual sequences to shorter sequences that contain a single audiovisual event, for three types of content: action, music, and speech. The resulting windows of temporal integration showed that participants were better at detecting asynchrony for the longer stimuli, possibly because the long-running sequences contain multiple corresponding events that offer audiovisual timing cues. Moreover, the points of subjective simultaneity differ between content types, suggesting that the nature of a visual scene could influence the temporal perception of events. An expected outcome from this type of experiment was the rich variation among participants' distributions and the derived points of subjective simultaneity. Hence, the designs of similar experiments call for more participants than traditional psychophysical studies. Heeding this caution, we conclude that existing theories on multisensory perception are ready to be tested on more natural and representative stimuli.


Title #1105: Do we harm others even if we don't need to?
PMID: 26082737
Authors: M Paula MP. Cacault, Lorenz L. Goette, Rafael R. Lalive, Mathias M. Thoenig
Abstract: Evolutionary explanations of the co-existence of large-scale cooperation and warfare in human societies rest on the hypothesis of parochial altruism, the view that in-group pro-sociality and out-group anti-sociality have co-evolved. We designed an experiment that allows subjects to freely choose between actions that are purely pro-social, purely anti-social, or a combination of the two. We present behavioral evidence on the existence of strong aggression-a pattern of non-strategic behaviors that are welfare-reducing for all individuals (i.e., victims and perpetrators). We also show how strong aggression serves to dynamically stabilize in-group pro-sociality.


Title #1106: Semantic-based crossmodal processing during visual suppression.
PMID: 26082736
Authors: Dustin D. Cox, Sang Wook SW. Hong
Abstract: To reveal the mechanisms underpinning the influence of auditory input on visual awareness, we examine, (1) whether purely semantic-based multisensory integration facilitates the access to visual awareness for familiar visual events, and (2) whether crossmodal semantic priming is the mechanism responsible for the semantic auditory influence on visual awareness. Using continuous flash suppression, we rendered dynamic and familiar visual events (e.g., a video clip of an approaching train) inaccessible to visual awareness. We manipulated the semantic auditory context of the videos by concurrently pairing them with a semantically matching soundtrack (congruent audiovisual condition), a semantically non-matching soundtrack (incongruent audiovisual condition), or with no soundtrack (neutral video-only condition). We found that participants identified the suppressed visual events significantly faster (an earlier breakup of suppression) in the congruent audiovisual condition compared to the incongruent audiovisual condition and video-only condition. However, this facilitatory influence of semantic auditory input was only observed when audiovisual stimulation co-occurred. Our results suggest that the enhanced visual processing with a semantically congruent auditory input occurs due to audiovisual crossmodal processing rather than semantic priming, which may occur even when visual information is not available to visual awareness.


Title #1107: Comparing the effectiveness of different displays in enhancing illusions of self-movement (vection).
PMID: 26082735
Authors: Bernhard E BE. Riecke, Jacqueline D JD. Jordan
Abstract: Illusions of self-movement (vection) can be used in virtual reality (VR) and other applications to give users the embodied sensation that they are moving when physical movement is unfeasible or too costly. Whereas a large body of vection literature studied how various parameters of the presented visual stimulus affect vection, little is known how different display types might affect vection. As a step toward addressing this gap, we conducted three experiments to compare vection and usability parameters between commonly used VR displays, ranging from stereoscopic projection and 3D TV to high-end head-mounted display (HMD, NVIS SX111) and recent low-cost HMD (Oculus Rift). The last experiment also compared these two HMDs in their native full field of view (FOV) and a reduced, matched FOV of 72Â° Ã 45Â°. Participants moved along linear and curvilinear paths in the virtual environment, reported vection onset time, and rated vection intensity at the end of each trial. In addition, user ratings on immersion, motion sickness, vection, and overall preference were recorded retrospectively and compared between displays. Unexpectedly, there were no significant effects of display on vection measures. Reducing the FOV for the HMDs (from full to 72Â° Ã 45Â°) decreased vection onset latencies, but did not affect vection intensity. As predicted, curvilinear paths yielded earlier and more intense vection. Although vection has often been proposed to predict or even cause motion sickness, we observed no correlation for any of the displays studied. In conclusion, perceived self-motion and other user experience measures proved surprisingly tolerant toward changes in display type as long as the FOV was roughly matched. This suggests that display choice for vection research and VR applications can be largely based on other considerations as long as the provided FOV is sufficiently large.


Title #1108: Single-trial lie detection using a combined fNIRS-polygraph system.
PMID: 26082733
Authors: M Raheel MR. Bhutta, Melissa J MJ. Hong, Yun-Hee YH. Kim, Keum-Shik KS. Hong
Abstract: Deception is a human behavior that many people experience in daily life. It involves complex neuronal activities in addition to several physiological changes in the body. A polygraph, which can measure some of the physiological responses from the body, has been widely employed in lie-detection. Many researchers, however, believe that lie detection can become more precise if the neuronal changes that occur in the process of deception can be isolated and measured. In this study, we combine both measures (i.e., physiological and neuronal changes) for enhanced lie-detection. Specifically, to investigate the deception-related hemodynamic response, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is applied at the prefrontal cortex besides a commercially available polygraph system. A mock crime scenario with a single-trial stimulus is set up as a deception protocol. The acquired data are classified into "true" and "lie" classes based on the fNIRS-based hemoglobin-concentration changes and polygraph-based physiological signal changes. Linear discriminant analysis is utilized as a classifier. The results indicate that the combined fNIRS-polygraph system delivers much higher classification accuracy than that of a singular system. This study demonstrates a plausible solution toward single-trial lie-detection by combining fNIRS and the polygraph.


Title #1109: Integrating optical finger motion tracking with surface touch events.
PMID: 26082732
Authors: Jennifer J. MacRitchie, Andrew P AP. McPherson
Abstract: This paper presents a method of integrating two contrasting sensor systems for studying human interaction with a mechanical system, using piano performance as the case study. Piano technique requires both precise small-scale motion of fingers on the key surfaces and planned large-scale movement of the hands and arms. Where studies of performance often focus on one of these scales in isolation, this paper investigates the relationship between them. Two sensor systems were installed on an acoustic grand piano: a monocular high-speed camera tracking the position of painted markers on the hands, and capacitive touch sensors attach to the key surfaces which measure the location of finger-key contacts. This paper highlights a method of fusing the data from these systems, including temporal and spatial alignment, segmentation into notes and automatic fingering annotation. Three case studies demonstrate the utility of the multi-sensor data: analysis of finger flexion or extension based on touch and camera marker location, timing analysis of finger-key contact preceding and following key presses, and characterization of individual finger movements in the transitions between successive key presses. Piano performance is the focus of this paper, but the sensor method could equally apply to other fine motor control scenarios, with applications to human-computer interaction.


Title #1110: Painful faces-induced attentional blink modulated by top-down and bottom-up mechanisms.
PMID: 26082731
Authors: Chun C. Zheng, Jin-Yan JY. Wang, Fei F. Luo
Abstract: Pain-related stimuli can capture attention in an automatic (bottom-up) or intentional (top-down) fashion. Previous studies have examined attentional capture by pain-related information using spatial attention paradigms that involve mainly a bottom-up mechanism. In the current study, we investigated the pain information-induced attentional blink (AB) using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, and compared the effects of task-irrelevant and task-relevant pain distractors. Relationships between accuracy of target identification and individual traits (i.e., empathy and catastrophizing thinking about pain) were also examined. The results demonstrated that task-relevant painful faces had a significant pain information-induced AB effect, whereas task-irrelevant faces showed a near-significant trend of this effect, supporting the notion that pain-related stimuli can influence the temporal dynamics of attention. Furthermore, we found a significant negative correlation between response accuracy and pain catastrophizing score in task-relevant trials. These findings suggest that active scanning of environmental information related to pain produces greater deficits in cognition than does unintentional attention toward pain, which may represent the different ways in which healthy individuals and patients with chronic pain process pain-relevant information. These results may provide insight into the understanding of maladaptive attentional processing in patients with chronic pain.


Title #1111: A quantitative epigenetic approach for the assessment of cigarette consumption.

Abstract: Smoking is the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Despite the development of numerous preventive and treatment interventions, the rate of daily smoking in the United States is still approximately 22%. Effective psychosocial interventions and pharmacologic agents exist for the prevention and treatment of smoking. Unfortunately, both approaches are hindered by our inability to accurately quantify amount of cigarette consumption from the point of initial experimentation to the point of total dependency. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that smoking is associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation. However, whether this advance in basic science can be employed as a reliable assay that is useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment has not been shown. In this communication, we determine the sensitivity and specificity of five of the most consistently replicated CpG loci with respect to smoking status using data from a publically available dataset. We show that methylation status at a CpG locus in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, cg05575921, is both sensitive and specific for smoking status in adults with a receiver operated curve characteristic area under the curve of 0.99. Given recent demonstrations that methylation at this locus reflects both intensity of smoking and the degree of smoking cessation, we conclude that a methylation-based diagnostic at this locus could have a prominent role in understanding the impact of new products, such as e-cigarettes on initiation of cigarette smoking among adolescents, while improving the prevention and treatment of smoking, and smoking related disorders.


Title #1112: Upregulated GABA Inhibitory Function in ADHD Children with Child Behavior Checklist-Dysregulation Profile: 123I-Iomazenil SPECT Study.
PMID: 26082729

Abstract: The child behavior checklist-dysregulation profile (CBCL-DP) refers to a pattern of elevated scores on the attention problems, aggression, and anxiety/depression subscales of the child behavior checklist. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of GABA inhibitory neurons in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dysregulation assessed with a dimensional measure. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 35 children with ADHD using 123I-iomazenil, which binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors. Iomazenil binding activities were assessed with respect to the presence or absence of a threshold CBCL-DP (a score â¥210 for the sum of the three subscales: Attention Problems, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression). We then attempted to identify which CBCL-DP subscale explained the most variance with respect to SPECT data, using "age," "sex," and "history of maltreatment" as covariates. Significantly higher iomazenil binding activity was seen in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of ADHD children with a significant CBCL-DP. The Anxiety/Depression subscale on the CBCL had significant effects on higher iomazenil binding activity in the left superior frontal, middle frontal, and temporal regions, as well as in the PCC. The present brain SPECT findings suggest that GABAergic inhibitory neurons may play an important role in the neurobiology of the CBCL-DP, in children with ADHD.


Title #1113: Schizotypal Traits are Associated with Poorer Executive Functioning in Healthy Adults.

Abstract: Previous research has shown mild forms of the neurocognitive impairments seen in schizophrenia among healthy individuals exhibiting high schizotypal traits. This study aimed to explore associations between schizotypy and cognitive performance in an adult community sample. Ninety-five females and 79 males completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE), which measures four separable aspects of schizotypy: cognitive disorganization, unusual experiences, introvertive anhedonia, and impulsive non-conformity. Subsequently, participants were administered a neurocognitive battery incorporating measures of executive skills including inhibition, cognitive flexibility, reasoning, and problem solving along with measures of attention and processing speed and both verbal and spatial working memory. In line with predictions, the current study found that higher scores on the subscales of unusual experiences, cognitive disorganization, and impulsive non-conformity related to worse performance on a measure of inhibition. Additionally, as introvertive anhedonia increased, both attention and processing speed and reasoning and problem-solving performance became more impaired. In conclusion, this study extends schizotypy literature by examining the subscales of the O-LIFE, and enables inferences to be drawn in relation to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.


Title #1114: Contingency Management and Deliberative Decision-Making Processes.
PMID: 26082725
Authors: Paul S PS. Regier, A David AD. Redish
Abstract: Contingency management is an effective treatment for drug addiction. The current explanation for its success is rooted in alternative reinforcement theory. We suggest that alternative reinforcement theory is inadequate to explain the success of contingency management and produce a model based on demand curves that show how little the monetary rewards offered in this treatment would affect drug use. Instead, we offer an explanation of its success based on the concept that it accesses deliberative decision-making processes. We suggest that contingency management is effective because it offers a concrete and immediate alternative to using drugs, which engages deliberative processes, improves the ability of those deliberative processes to attend to non-drug options, and offsets more automatic action-selection systems. This theory makes explicit predictions that can be tested, suggests which users will be most helped by contingency management, and suggests improvements in its implementation.


Title #1115: The trajectory of life. Decreasing physiological network complexity through changing fractal patterns.
PMID: 26082722
Authors: Joachim P JP. Sturmberg, Jeanette M JM. Bennett, Martin M. Picard, Andrew J E AJ. Seely
Abstract: In this position paper, we submit a synthesis of theoretical models based on physiology, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and non-linear time-series analysis. Based on an understanding of the human organism as a system of interconnected complex adaptive systems, we seek to examine the relationship between health, complexity, variability, and entropy production, as it might be useful to help understand aging, and improve care for patients. We observe the trajectory of life is characterized by the growth, plateauing and subsequent loss of adaptive function of organ systems, associated with loss of functioning and coordination of systems. Understanding development and aging requires the examination of interdependence among these organ systems. Increasing evidence suggests network interconnectedness and complexity can be captured/measured/associated with the degree and complexity of healthy biologic rhythm variability (e.g., heart and respiratory rate variability). We review physiological mechanisms linking the omics, arousal/stress systems, immune function, and mitochondrial bioenergetics; highlighting their interdependence in normal physiological function and aging. We argue that aging, known to be characterized by a loss of variability, is manifested at multiple scales, within functional units at the small scale, and reflected by diagnostic features at the larger scale. While still controversial and under investigation, it appears conceivable that the integrity of whole body complexity may be, at least partially, reflected in the degree and variability of intrinsic biologic rhythms, which we believe are related to overall system complexity that may be a defining feature of health and it's loss through aging. Harnessing this information for the development of therapeutic and preventative strategies may hold an opportunity to significantly improve the health of our patients across the trajectory of life.


Title #1116: Therapeutic isolation and expansion of human skeletal muscle-derived stem cells for the use of muscle-nerve-blood vessel reconstitution.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle makes up 40-50% of body mass, and is thus considered to be a good adult stem cell source for autologous therapy. Although, several stem/progenitor cells have been fractionated from mouse skeletal muscle showing a high potential for therapeutic use, it is unclear whether this is the case in human. Differentiation and therapeutic potential of human skeletal muscle-derived cells (Sk-Cs) was examined. Samples (5-10 g) were obtained from the abdominal and leg muscles of 36 patients (age, 17-79 years) undergoing prostate cancer treatment or leg amputation surgery. All patients gave informed consent. Sk-Cs were isolated using conditioned collagenase solution, and were then sorted as CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD29(+) (Sk-DN/29(+)) and CD34(+)/CD45(-) (Sk-34) cells, in a similar manner as for the previous mouse Sk-Cs. Both cell fractions were appropriately expanded using conditioned culture medium for about 2 weeks. Differentiation potentials were then examined during cell culture and in vivo transplantation into the severely damaged muscles of athymic nude mice and rats. Interestingly, these two cell fractions could be divided into highly myogenic (Sk-DN/29(+)) and multipotent stem cell (Sk-34) fractions, in contrast to mouse Sk-Cs, which showed comparable capacities in both cells. At 6 weeks after the separate transplantation of both cell fractions, the former showed an active contribution to muscle fiber regeneration, but the latter showed vigorous engraftment to the interstitium associated with differentiation into Schwann cells, perineurial/endoneurial cells, and vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, which corresponded to previous observations with mouse SK-Cs. Importantly, mixed cultures of both cells resulted the reduction of tissue reconstitution capacities in vivo, whereas co-transplantation after separate expansion showed favorable results. Therefore, human Sk-Cs are potentially applicable to therapeutic autografts and show multiple differentiation potential in vivo.


Title #1117: Antimicrobial and immune modulatory effects of lactic acid and short chain fatty acids produced by vaginal microbiota associated with eubiosis and bacterial vaginosis.

Abstract: Lactic acid and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by vaginal microbiota have reported antimicrobial and immune modulatory activities indicating their potential as biomarkers of disease and/or disease susceptibility. In asymptomatic women of reproductive-age the vaginal microbiota is comprised of lactic acid-producing bacteria that are primarily responsible for the production of lactic acid present at ~110 mM and acidifying the vaginal milieu to pH ~3.5. In contrast, bacterial vaginosis (BV), a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota, is characterized by decreased lactic acid-producing microbiota and increased diverse anaerobic bacteria accompanied by an elevated pH>4.5. BV is also characterized by a dramatic loss of lactic acid and greater concentrations of mixed SCFAs including acetate, propionate, butyrate, and succinate. Notably women with lactic acid-producing microbiota have more favorable reproductive and sexual health outcomes compared to women with BV. Regarding the latter, BV is associated with increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. In vitro studies demonstrate that lactic acid produced by vaginal microbiota has microbicidal and virucidal activities that may protect against STIs and endogenous opportunistic bacteria as well as immune modulatory properties that require further characterization with regard to their effects on the vaginal mucosa. In contrast, BV-associated SCFAs have far less antimicrobial activity with the potential to contribute to a pro-inflammatory vaginal environment. Here we review the composition of lactic acid and SCFAs in respective states of eubiosis (non-BV) or dysbiosis (BV), their effects on susceptibility to bacterial/viral STIs and whether they have inherent microbicidal/virucidal and immune modulatory properties. We also explore their potential as biomarkers for the presence and/or increased susceptibility to STIs.


Title #1118: Circadian clocks, feeding time, and metabolic homeostasis.
PMID: 26082718
Authors: Georgios K GK. Paschos
Abstract: Metabolic processes exhibit diurnal variation from cyanobacteria to humans. The circadian clock is thought to have evolved as a time keeping system for the cell to optimize the timing of metabolic events according to physiological needs and environmental conditions. Circadian rhythms temporally separate incompatible cellular processes and optimize cellular and organismal fitness. A modern 24 h lifestyle can run at odds with the circadian rhythm dictated by our molecular clocks and create desynchrony between internal and external timing. It has been suggested that this desynchrony compromises metabolic homeostasis and may promote the development of obesity (Morris et al., 2012). Here we review the evidence supporting the association between circadian misalignment and metabolic homeostasis and discuss the role of feeding time.


Title #1119: Intranasal deferoxamine attenuates synapse loss via up-regulating the P38/HIF-1Î± pathway on the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

Abstract: The widely recognized neuroprotective effect of iron chelators is contributed by their ability to prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via the Fenton reaction, which sequesters redox-active Fe. An additional neuroprotective mechanism of iron-chelating compounds is to regulate the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±). In the present study, we observed that intranasal administration of deferoxamine decreased beta-amyloid (AÎ²) deposition and rescued synapse loss in the brain of AÎ² precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice. We found that deferoxamine (DFO) up-regulated HIF-1Î± mRNA expression and its protein level, and further induced the proteins that are encoded from HIF-1-adaptive genes, including transferrin receptor (TFR), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The effects of DFO on the induction and stabilization of HIF-1Î± were further confirmed in vitro. This was accompanied by a decrease of Fe in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Western blotting studies revealed that DFO differentially enhanced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/P38 kinase in vitro and in vivo. The results suggest that the DFO may up-regulate several HIF-1-dependent neuroprotective-adaptive genes in AD via activating P38/HIF-1Î± pathway, which may serve as important therapeutic targets to the disease.


Title #1120: Ecological Assessment of Autonomy in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living in Dementia Patients by the Means of an Automatic Video Monitoring System.

Abstract: Currently, the assessment of autonomy and functional ability involves clinical rating scales. However, scales are often limited in their ability to provide objective and sensitive information. By contrast, information and communication technologies may overcome these limitations by capturing more fully functional as well as cognitive disturbances associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated the quantitative assessment of autonomy in dementia patients based not only on gait analysis but also on the participant performance on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) automatically recognized by a video event monitoring system (EMS). Three groups of participants (healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients) had to carry out a standardized scenario consisting of physical tasks (single and dual task) and several IADL such as preparing a pillbox or making a phone call while being recorded. After, video sensor data were processed by an EMS that automatically extracts kinematic parameters of the participants' gait and recognizes their carried out activities. These parameters were then used for the assessment of the participants' performance levels, here referred as autonomy. Autonomy assessment was approached as classification task using artificial intelligence methods that takes as input the parameters extracted by the EMS, here referred as behavioral profile. Activities were accurately recognized by the EMS with high precision. The most accurately recognized activities were "prepare medication" with 93% and "using phone" with 89% precision. The diagnostic group classifier obtained a precision of 73.46% when combining the analyses of physical tasks with IADL. In a further analysis, the created autonomy group classifier which obtained a precision of 83.67% when combining physical tasks and IADL. Results suggest that it is possible to quantitatively assess IADL functioning supported by an EMS and that even based on the extracted data the groups could be classified with high accuracy. This means that the use of such technologies may provide clinicians with diagnostic relevant information to improve autonomy assessment in real time decreasing observer biases.


Title #1121: Minimal approach to neuro-inspired information processing.
PMID: 26082714
Authors: Miguel C MC. Soriano, Daniel D. Brunner, Miguel M. Escalona-MorÃ¡n, Claudio R CR. Mirasso, Ingo I. Fischer
Abstract: To learn and mimic how the brain processes information has been a major research challenge for decades. Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing (RC) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional RC, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.


Title #1122: Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning.
PMID: 26082713

Abstract: Early diagnosis or detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the normal elder control (NC) is very important. However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions.


Title #1123: Multiscale entropy analysis of biological signals: a fundamental bi-scaling law.
PMID: 26082711
Authors: Jianbo J. Gao, Jing J. Hu, Feiyan F. Liu, Yinhe Y. Cao
Abstract: Since introduced in early 2000, multiscale entropy (MSE) has found many applications in biosignal analysis, and been extended to multivariate MSE. So far, however, no analytic results for MSE or multivariate MSE have been reported. This has severely limited our basic understanding of MSE. For example, it has not been studied whether MSE estimated using default parameter values and short data set is meaningful or not. Nor is it known whether MSE has any relation with other complexity measures, such as the Hurst parameter, which characterizes the correlation structure of the data. To overcome this limitation, and more importantly, to guide more fruitful applications of MSE in various areas of life sciences, we derive a fundamental bi-scaling law for fractal time series, one for the scale in phase space, the other for the block size used for smoothing. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by examining two types of physiological data. One is heart rate variability (HRV) data, for the purpose of distinguishing healthy subjects from patients with congestive heart failure, a life-threatening condition. The other is electroencephalogram (EEG) data, for the purpose of distinguishing epileptic seizure EEG from normal healthy EEG.


Title #1124: A stimulus-dependent spike threshold is an optimal neural coder.
PMID: 26082710
Authors: Douglas L DL. Jones, Erik C EC. Johnson, Rama R. Ratnam
Abstract: A neural code based on sequences of spikes can consume a significant portion of the brain's energy budget. Thus, energy considerations would dictate that spiking activity be kept as low as possible. However, a high spike-rate improves the coding and representation of signals in spike trains, particularly in sensory systems. These are competing demands, and selective pressure has presumably worked to optimize coding by apportioning a minimum number of spikes so as to maximize coding fidelity. The mechanisms by which a neuron generates spikes while maintaining a fidelity criterion are not known. Here, we show that a signal-dependent neural threshold, similar to a dynamic or adapting threshold, optimizes the trade-off between spike generation (encoding) and fidelity (decoding). The threshold mimics a post-synaptic membrane (a low-pass filter) and serves as an internal decoder. Further, it sets the average firing rate (the energy constraint). The decoding process provides an internal copy of the coding error to the spike-generator which emits a spike when the error equals or exceeds a spike threshold. When optimized, the trade-off leads to a deterministic spike firing-rule that generates optimally timed spikes so as to maximize fidelity. The optimal coder is derived in closed-form in the limit of high spike-rates, when the signal can be approximated as a piece-wise constant signal. The predicted spike-times are close to those obtained experimentally in the primary electrosensory afferent neurons of weakly electric fish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) and pyramidal neurons from the somatosensory cortex of the rat. We suggest that KCNQ/Kv7 channels (underlying the M-current) are good candidates for the decoder. They are widely coupled to metabolic processes and do not inactivate. We conclude that the neural threshold is optimized to generate an energy-efficient and high-fidelity neural code.


Title #1125: Loads and loads and loads: the influence of prospective load, retrospective load, and ongoing task load in prospective memory.
PMID: 26082709
Authors: Beat B. Meier, Thomas D TD. Zimmermann
Abstract: In prospective memory tasks different kinds of load can occur. Adding a prospective memory task can impose a load on ongoing task performance. Adding ongoing task load (OTL) can affect prospective memory performance. The existence of multiple target events increases prospective load (PL) and adding complexity to the to-be-remembered action increases retrospective load (RL). In two experiments, we systematically examined the effects of these different types of load on prospective memory performance. Results showed an effect of PL on costs in the ongoing task for categorical targets (Experiment 2), but not for specific targets (Experiment 1). RL and OTL both affected remembering the retrospective component of the prospective memory task. We suggest that PL can enhance costs in the ongoing task due to additional monitoring requirements. RL and OTL seem to impact the division of resources between the ongoing task and retrieval of the retrospective component, which may affect disengagement from the ongoing task. In general, the results demonstrate that the different types of load affect prospective memory differentially.


Title #1126: Gray Matter Volume Changes in the Apathetic Elderly.
PMID: 26082708
Authors: Hongjie H. Yan, Keiichi K. Onoda, Shuhei S. Yamaguchi
Abstract: This study is to test the hypothesis that apathy in healthy participants is closely related to the prefrontal-basal-ganglia circuit and associated structural changes. We selected 36 healthy aged participants with (nâ=â18) or without apathy (nâ=â18) from our database. Participants underwent structural MRI scanning, providing data for voxel-based morphometric analysis to explore gray matter changes associated with apathy. Compared to the non-apathy group, the apathy group showed reduced gray matter volume of the right putamen, whereas volumes of the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left inferior occipital gyrus showed increase. When depression scores were included in a regression model as a covariate, apathetic participants showed decreased gray matter volume in the right precentral gyrus compared to the non-apathetic participants. These findings suggest that apathy is associated with the gray matter volume in the prefrontal-basal-ganglia network, and may have a neuroanatomical basis distinct from depression in healthy elderly.


Title #1127: May Functional Imaging be Helpful for Behavioral Assessment in Children? Regions of Motor and Associative Cortico-Subcortical Circuits Can be Differentiated by Laterality and Rostrality.
PMID: 26082707
Authors: Julia M JM. August, Aribert A. Rothenberger, Juergen J. Baudewig, Veit V. Roessner, Peter P. Dechent
Abstract: Cortico-subcortical circuits are organized into the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic loop. These neuronal preconditions play an important role regarding the understanding and treatment of behavioral problems in children. Differencing evidence argues for a lateralized organization of the sensorimotor loop and a bilateral (i.e., non-lateralized) organization of the associative loop. However, a firm behavioral-neurobiological distinction of these circuits has been difficult, specifically in children.


Title #1128: A Cohort Pilot Study on HIV-Associated Neuropsychological Impairments in Hemophilia Patients.

Abstract: Despite advances in the management of HIV infection with the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy, it is well known that HIV can directly infect the central nervous system and, as a result of such infection, neuropsychological impairments can be manifested. In this study, we tried to determine whether seropositivity was associated with a poor neuropsychological performance in patients with hemophilia and HIV. Such a cohort of patients is very often underrepresented and understudied in the HIV literature. To amend such a gap, we carried out an extensive neuropsychological evaluation on these patients, and compared their performance with that of a group of seronegative hemophilia patients. The results revealed that HIV infection in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) hemophilia patients was associated with deficits in attention, short-term memory, abstraction, and visual recognition. Such results are still preliminary and explorative due to the small cohort of patients enrolled. However, the results do seem to have some important implications for day-to-day functioning, as the level of impairment detected may cause difficulties in completing common everyday tasks such as maintaining adherence to complex medication regimens or maintaining social life activities. Continued research into the mechanisms related to HIV and neurocognitive dysfunction may provide targets for interventions that could have meaningful consequences in the real world for HIV hemophilia patients.


Title #1129: Effects of user mental state on EEG-BCI performance.
PMID: 26082705
Authors: Andrew A. Myrden, Tom T. Chau
Abstract: Changes in psychological state have been proposed as a cause of variation in brain-computer interface performance, but little formal analysis has been conducted to support this hypothesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of three mental states-fatigue, frustration, and attention-on BCI performance. Twelve able-bodied participants were trained to use a two-class EEG-BCI based on the performance of user-specific mental tasks. Following training, participants completed three testing sessions, during which they used the BCI to play a simple maze navigation game while periodically reporting their perceived levels of fatigue, frustration, and attention. Statistical analysis indicated that there is a significant relationship between frustration and BCI performance while the relationship between fatigue and BCI performance approached significance. BCI performance was 7% lower than average when self-reported fatigue was low and 7% higher than average when self-reported frustration was moderate. A multivariate analysis of mental state revealed the presence of contiguous regions in mental state space where BCI performance was more accurate than average, suggesting the importance of moderate fatigue for achieving effortless focus on BCI control, frustration as a potential motivating factor, and attention as a compensatory mechanism to increasing frustration. Finally, a visual analysis showed the sensitivity of underlying class distributions to changes in mental state. Collectively, these results indicate that mental state is closely related to BCI performance, encouraging future development of psychologically adaptive BCIs.

Abstract: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) share the clinical symptom of disturbed body image, which may be a function of perceptual distortions. Previous studies suggest visual or visuospatial processing abnormalities may be contributory, but have been unable to discern whether these occur early or late in the visual processing stream. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and visual event related potentials (ERP) to investigate early perceptual neural activity associated with processing visual stimuli.


Title #1131: Flow and Meaningfulness as Mechanisms of Change in Self-Concept and Well-Being Following a Songwriting Intervention for People in the Early Phase of Neurorehabilitation.

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that songwriting assists people with spinal cord injury (SCI) or acquired brain injury (ABI) to explore threats to self-concept, yet studies that explore the mechanisms of change have not been reported. In a pilot study, we explored the correlations between changes in self-concept and well-being, with mechanisms of flow and meaningfulness of songwriting. Five people with ABI (all male) and 5 SCI (4 males, 1 female) (mean age 38.90âyears, SDâ=â13.21), with an average 3âmonths post-injury, participated in a 12-session songwriting program that targeted examination of self-concept. Measures of self-concept, depression, anxiety, emotion regulation, affect, satisfaction with life, and flourishing were collected pre-, mid-, and post-intervention, and compared with repeated measures of flow and meaningfulness of songwriting. Medium effects were found for changes in self-concept (dâ=â0.557) and depression (dâ=â0.682) and approached a medium effect for negative affect (dâ=â0.491). Improvements in self-concept over time were associated with decreases in depression (r pâ=â-0.874, nâ=â9, pâ<â0.01), anxiety (r pâ=â-0.866, nâ=â9, pâ<â0.01), and negative affect (r pâ=â-0.694, nâ=â10, pâ<â0.05), and an increase in flourishing (r pâ=â+0.866, nâ=â9, pâ<â0.01) and positive affect (r pâ=â+â0.731, nâ=â10, pâ<â0.05). Strong experiences of flow were not positively correlated with positive changes to self-concept and well-being, whereas deriving high levels of meaning were associated with increased negative affect (r pâ=â+0.68 pâ<â0.05), increased anxiety (r pâ=â+0.74, pâ<â0.05), and reduced emotional suppression (r pâ=â-0.58, pâ<â0.05). These findings show that the targeted songwriting intervention appears to be positively associated with enhanced well-being outcomes. However, the findings also suggest that people who find the songwriting process has strong meaning for them might be more likely to start accepting their emotions and as a result experience an increase in anxiety and depression, although full, mediated regression analyses with larger sample sizes are required to explore this further. Acknowledging their changed circumstances may nonetheless assist people with SCI and ABI to grieve their losses and facilitate the building of a healthy post-injured self-concept. We propose that there may be other mechanisms more critical in facilitating the positive changes in self-concept and well-being than flow and meaning, such as the role of story-telling and the impact of music in facilitating the consolidation of self-concept explorations in memory.


Title #1132: Neurally dissociable cognitive components of reading deficits in subacute stroke.
PMID: 26082701
Authors: Olga O. Boukrina, A M AM. Barrett, Edward J EJ. Alexander, Bing B. Yao, William W WW. Graves
Abstract: According to cognitive models of reading, words are processed by interacting orthographic (spelling), phonological (sound), and semantic (meaning) information. Despite extensive study of the neural basis of reading in healthy participants, little group data exist on patients with reading deficits from focal brain damage pointing to critical neural systems for reading. Here, we report on one such study. We have performed neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging on 11 patients with left-hemisphere stroke (<=5 weeks post-stroke). Patients completed tasks assessing cognitive components of reading such as semantics (matching picture or word choices to a target based on meaning), phonology (matching word choices to a target based on rhyming), and orthography (a two-alternative forced choice of the most plausible non-word). They also read aloud pseudowords and words with high or low levels of usage frequency, imageability, and spelling-sound consistency. As predicted by the cognitive model, when averaged across patients, the influence of semantics was most salient for low-frequency, low-consistency words, when phonological decoding is especially difficult. Qualitative subtraction analyses revealed lesion sites specific to phonological processing. These areas were consistent with those shown previously to activate for phonology in healthy participants, including supramarginal, posterior superior temporal, middle temporal, inferior frontal gyri, and underlying white matter. Notable divergence between this analysis and previous functional imaging is the association of lesions in the mid-fusiform gyrus and anterior temporal lobe with phonological reading deficits. This study represents progress toward identifying brain lesion-deficit relationships in the cognitive components of reading. Such correspondences are expected to help not only better understand the neural mechanisms of reading, but may also help tailor reading therapy to individual neurocognitive deficit profiles.


Title #1133: Differential age-related changes in N170 responses to upright faces, inverted faces, and eyes in Japanese children.
PMID: 26082700

Abstract: The main objectives of this study were to investigate the development of face perception in Japanese children, focusing on the changes in face processing strategies (holistic and/or configural vs. feature-based) that occur during childhood. To achieve this, we analyzed the face-related N170 component, evoked by upright face, inverted face, and eyes stimuli in 82 Japanese children aged between 8- and 13-years-old. During the experiment, the children were asked to perform a target detection task in which they were told to press a button when they saw images of faces or kettles with mustaches, glasses, and fake noses; i.e., an implicit face perception task. The N170 signals observed after the presentation of the upright face stimuli were longer in duration and/or had at least two peaks in the 8-11-year-old children, whereas those seen in the 12-13-year-old children were sharp and only had a single peak. N170 latency was significantly longer after the presentation of the eyes stimuli than after the presentation of the upright face stimuli in the 10- and 12-year-old children. In addition, significant differences in N170 latency were observed among all three stimulus types in the 13-year-old children. N170 amplitude was significantly greater after the presentation of the eyes stimuli than after the presentation of the upright face stimuli in the 8-10- and 12-year-old children. The results of the present study indicate that the upright face stimuli were processed using holistic and/or configural processing by the 13-year-old children.


Title #1134: Neuroplastic effects of transcranial near-infrared stimulation (tNIRS) on the motor cortex.
PMID: 26082699
Authors: Leila L. Chaieb, Andrea A. Antal, Florentin F. Masurat, Walter W. Paulus
Abstract: Near-infrared light stimulation of the brain has been claimed to improve deficits caused by traumatic brain injury and stroke. Here, we exploit the effect of transcranial near-infrared stimulation (tNIRS) as a tool to modulate cortical excitability in the healthy human brain. tNIRS was applied at a wavelength of 810 nm for 10 min over the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1). Both single-pulse and paired-pulse measures of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were used to assess levels of cortical excitability in the corticospinal pathway and intracortical circuits. The serial reaction time task (SRTT) was used to investigate the possible effect of tNIRS on implicit learning. By evaluating the mean amplitude of single-pulse TMS elicited motor-evoked-potentials (MEPs) a significant decrease of the amplitude was observed up to 30 min post-stimulation, compared to baseline. Furthermore, the short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) was increased and facilitation (ICF) decreased significantly after tNIRS. The results from the SRTT experiment show that there was no net effect of stimulation on the performance of the participants. Results of a study questionnaire demonstrated that tNIRS did not induce serious side effects apart from light headache and fatigue. Nevertheless, 66% were able to detect the difference between active and sham stimulation conditions. In this study we provide further evidence that tNIRS is suitable as a tool for influencing cortical excitability and activity in the healthy human brain.


Title #1135: Programming of stress-related behavior and epigenetic neural gene regulation in mice offspring through maternal exposure to predator odor.
PMID: 26082698
Authors: Sophie S. St-Cyr, Patrick O PO. McGowan
Abstract: Perinatal stress mediated through the mother can lead to long-term alterations in stress-related phenotypes in offspring. The capacity for adaptation to adversity in early life depends in part on the life history of the animal. This study was designed to examine the behavioral and neural response in adult offspring to prenatal exposure to predator odor: an ethologically-relevant psychological stressor. Pregnant mice were exposed daily to predator odors or distilled water control over the second half of the pregnancy. Predator odor exposure lead to a transient decrease in maternal care in the mothers. As adults, the offspring of predator odor-exposed mothers showed increased anti-predator behavior, a predator-odor induced decrease in activity and, in female offspring, an increased corticosterone (CORT) response to predator odor exposure. We found a highly specific response among stress-related genes within limbic brain regions. Transcript abundance of Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) was elevated in the amygdala in adult female offspring of predator odor-exposed mothers. In the hippocampus of adult female offspring, decreased Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcript abundance was correlated with a site-specific decrease in DNA methylation in Bdnf exon IV, indicating the potential contribution of this epigenetic mechanism to maternal programming by maternal predator odor exposure. These data indicate that maternal predator odor exposure alone is sufficient to induce an altered stress-related phenotype in adulthood, with implications for anti-predator behavior in offspring.


Title #1136: Fronto-limbic novelty processing in acute psychosis: disrupted relationship with memory performance and potential implications for delusions.
PMID: 26082697

Abstract: Recent concepts have highlighted the role of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) in positive symptoms like delusions in schizophrenia. In healthy individuals, the MTL is critically involved in the detection and encoding of novel information. Here, we aimed to investigate whether dysfunctional novelty processing by the MTL might constitute a potential neural mechanism contributing to the pathophysiology of delusions, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 16 unmedicated patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 20 age-matched healthy controls. All patients experienced positive symptoms at time of participation. Participants performed a visual target detection task with complex scene stimuli in which novel and familiar rare stimuli were presented randomly intermixed with a standard and a target picture. Presentation of novel relative to familiar images was associated with hippocampal activation in both patients and healthy controls, but only healthy controls showed a positive relationship between novelty-related hippocampal activation and recognition memory performance after 24 h. Patients, but not controls, showed a robust neural response in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during presentation of novel stimuli. Functional connectivity analysis in the patients further revealed a novelty-related increase of functional connectivity of both the hippocampus and the OFC with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the ventral striatum (VS). Notably, delusions correlated positively with the difference of the functional connectivity of the hippocampus vs. the OFC with the rACC. Taken together, our results suggest that alterations of fronto-limbic novelty processing may contribute to the pathophysiology of delusions in patients with acute psychosis.


Title #1137: Task-specific enhancement of hippocampus-dependent learning in mice deficient in monoacylglycerol lipase, the major hydrolyzing enzyme of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol.

Abstract: Growing evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid system is important for the acquisition and/or extinction of learning and memory. However, it is unclear which endocannabinoid(s) play(s) a crucial role in these cognitive functions, especially memory extinction. To elucidate the physiological role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), a major endocannabinoid, in behavioral and cognitive functions, we conducted a comprehensive behavioral test battery in knockout (KO) mice deficient in monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the major hydrolyzing enzyme of 2-AG. We found age-dependent increases in spontaneous physical activity (SPA) in MGL KO mice. Next, we tested the MGL KO mice using 5 hippocampus-dependent learning paradigms (i.e., Morris water maze (MWM), contextual fear conditioning, novel object recognition test, trace eyeblink conditioning, and water-finding test). In the MWM, MGL KO mice showed normal acquisition of reference memory, but exhibited significantly faster extinction of the learned behavior. Moreover, they showed faster memory acquisition on the reversal-learning task of the MWM. In contrast, in the contextual fear conditioning, MGL KO mice tended to show slower memory extinction. In the novel object recognition and water-finding tests, MGL KO mice exhibited enhanced memory acquisition. Trace eyeblink conditioning was not altered in MGL KO mice throughout the acquisition and extinction phases. These results indicate that 2-AG signaling is important for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, but its contribution is highly task-dependent.


Title #1138: Increased skin conductance responses and neural activity during fear conditioning are associated with a repressive coping style.
PMID: 26082695
Authors: Tim T. Klucken, Onno O. Kruse, Jan J. Schweckendiek, Rudolf R. Stark
Abstract: The investigation of individual differences in coping styles in response to fear conditioning is an important issue for a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. It has been assumed that an avoidant (repressive) coping style is characterized by increased emotion regulation efforts in context of fear stimuli as compared to a more vigilant coping style. However, no study so far has investigated the neural correlates of fear conditioning of repressors and sensitizers. In the present fMRI study, 76 participants were classified as repressors or as sensitizers and were exposed to a fear conditioning paradigm, in which the CS+ predicted electrical stimulation, while another neutral stimulus (CS-) did not. In addition, skin conductance responses (SCRs) were measured continuously. As the main findings, we found increased neural activity in repressors as compared to sensitizers in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during fear conditioning. In addition, elevated activity to the CS+ in amygdala, insula, occipital, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as well as elevated conditioned SCRs were found in repressors. The present results demonstrate increased neural activations in structures linked to emotion down-regulation mechanisms like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which may reflect the increased coping effort in repressors. At the same time, repressors showed increased activations in arousal and evaluation-associated structures like the amygdala, the occipital cortex (OCC), and the OFC, which was mirrored in increased SCRs. The present results support recent assumptions about a two-process model of repression postulating a fast vigilant response to fear stimuli, and a second process associated with the down-regulation of emotional responses.


Title #1139: Transfer of training from one working memory task to another: behavioural and neural evidence.

Abstract: N-back working memory (WM) tasks necessitate the maintenance and updating of dynamic rehearsal sets during performance. The delayed matching-to-sample (dMTS) task is another WM task, which in turn involves the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of stimulus representations in sequential order. Because both n-back and dMTS engage WM function, we hypothesized that compared to a control task not taxing WM, training on the n-back task would be associated with better performance on dMTS by virtue of training a shared mental capacity. We tested this hypothesis by randomly assigning subjects (N = 43) to train on either the n-back (including 2-back and 3-back levels) or an active control task. Following training, dMTS was administered in the fMRI scanner. The n-back group performed marginally better than the active control group on dMTS. In addition, although the n-back group improved more on the less difficult 2-back level than the more difficult 3-back level across training sessions, it was improvement on the 3-back level that accounted for 21% of the variance in dMTS performance. For the control group, improvement in training across sessions was unrelated to dMTS performance. At the neural level, greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum distinguished the n-back group from the control group in the maintenance phase of dMTS. Degree of improvement on the 3-back level across training sessions was correlated with activation in right lateral prefrontal and motor cortices in the maintenance phase of dMTS. Our results suggest that although n-back training is more likely to improve performance in easier blocks, it is improvement in more difficult blocks that is predictive of performance on a target task drawing on WM. In addition, the extent to which training on a task can transfer to another task is likely due to the engagement of shared cognitive capacities and underlying neural substrates-in this case WM.


Title #1140: Kv1 channels and neural processing in vestibular calyx afferents.
PMID: 26082693
Authors: Frances L FL. Meredith, Matthew E ME. Kirk, Katherine J KJ. Rennie
Abstract: Potassium-selective ion channels are important for accurate transmission of signals from auditory and vestibular sensory end organs to their targets in the central nervous system. During different gravity conditions, astronauts experience altered input signals from the peripheral vestibular system resulting in sensorimotor dysfunction. Adaptation to altered sensory input occurs, but it is not explicitly known whether this involves synaptic modifications within the vestibular epithelia. Future investigations of such potential plasticity require a better understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the known heterogeneity of afferent discharge under normal conditions. This study advances this understanding by examining the role of the Kv1 potassium channel family in mediating action potentials in specialized vestibular afferent calyx endings in the gerbil crista and utricle. Pharmacological agents selective for different sub-types of Kv1 channels were tested on membrane responses in whole cell recordings in the crista. Kv1 channels sensitive to Î±-dendrotoxin and dendrotoxin-K were found to prevail in the central regions, whereas K(+) channels sensitive to margatoxin, which blocks Kv1.3 and 1.6 channels, were more prominent in peripheral regions. Margatoxin-sensitive currents showed voltage-dependent inactivation. Dendrotoxin-sensitive currents showed no inactivation and dampened excitability in calyces in central neuroepithelial regions. The differential distribution of Kv1 potassium channels in vestibular afferents supports their importance in accurately relaying gravitational and head movement signals through specialized lines to the central nervous system. Pharmacological modulation of specific groups of K(+) channels could help alleviate vestibular dysfunction on earth and in space.


Title #1141: Task-dependent calibration of auditory spatial perception through environmental visual observation.
PMID: 26082692
Authors: Alessia A. Tonelli, Luca L. Brayda, Monica M. Gori
Abstract: Visual information is paramount to space perception. Vision influences auditory space estimation. Many studies show that simultaneous visual and auditory cues improve precision of the final multisensory estimate. However, the amount or the temporal extent of visual information, that is sufficient to influence auditory perception, is still unknown. It is therefore interesting to know if vision can improve auditory precision through a short-term environmental observation preceding the audio task and whether this influence is task-specific or environment-specific or both. To test these issues we investigate possible improvements of acoustic precision with sighted blindfolded participants in two audio tasks [minimum audible angle (MAA) and space bisection] and two acoustically different environments (normal room and anechoic room). With respect to a baseline of auditory precision, we found an improvement of precision in the space bisection task but not in the MAA after the observation of a normal room. No improvement was found when performing the same task in an anechoic chamber. In addition, no difference was found between a condition of short environment observation and a condition of full vision during the whole experimental session. Our results suggest that even short-term environmental observation can calibrate auditory spatial performance. They also suggest that echoes can be the cue that underpins visual calibration. Echoes may mediate the transfer of information from the visual to the auditory system.


Title #1142: Binocular misalignments elicited by altered gravity provide evidence for nonlinear central compensation.
PMID: 26082691
Authors: Kara H KH. Beaton, W Cary WC. Huffman, Michael C MC. Schubert
Abstract: Increased ocular positioning misalignments upon exposure to altered gravity levels (g-levels) have been strongly correlated with space motion sickness (SMS) severity, possibly due to underlying otolith asymmetries uncompensated in novel gravitational environments. We investigated vertical and torsional ocular positioning misalignments elicited by the 0 and 1.8 g g-levels of parabolic flight and used these data to develop a computational model to describe how such misalignments might arise. Ocular misalignments were inferred through two perceptual nulling tasks: Vertical Alignment Nulling (VAN) and Torsional Alignment Nulling (TAN). All test subjects exhibited significant differences in ocular misalignments in the novel g-levels, which we postulate to be the result of healthy individuals with 1 g-tuned central compensatory mechanisms unadapted to the parabolic flight environment. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of ocular misalignments in hypo-g and hyper-g, in comparison to 1 g, were nonlinear and nonmonotonic. Previous linear models of central compensation do not predict this. Here we show that a single model of the form a + bg (Îµ), where a, b, and Îµ are the model parameters and g is the current g-level, accounts for both the vertical and torsional ocular misalignment data observed inflight. Furthering our understanding of oculomotor control is critical for the development of interventions that promote adaptation in spaceflight (e.g., countermeasures for novel g-level exposure) and terrestrial (e.g., rehabilitation protocols for vestibular pathology) environments.


Title #1143: One hand clapping: lateralization of motor control.
PMID: 26082690
Authors: Quentin Q. Welniarz, Isabelle I. Dusart, CÃ©cile C. Gallea, Emmanuel E. Roze
Abstract: Lateralization of motor control refers to the ability to produce pure unilateral or asymmetric movements. It is required for a variety of coordinated activities, including skilled bimanual tasks and locomotion. Here we discuss the neuroanatomical substrates and pathophysiological underpinnings of lateralized motor outputs. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the past few years by studying the two known conditions characterized by the inability to properly produce unilateral or asymmetric movements, namely human patients with congenital "mirror movements" and model rodents with a "hopping gait". Whereas mirror movements are associated with altered interhemispheric connectivity and abnormal corticospinal projections, abnormal spinal cord interneurons trajectory is responsible for the "hopping gait". Proper commissural axon guidance is a critical requirement for these mechanisms. Interestingly, the analysis of these two conditions reveals that the production of asymmetric movements involves similar anatomical and functional requirements but in two different structures: (i) lateralized activation of the brain or spinal cord through contralateral silencing by cross-midline inhibition; and (ii) unilateral transmission of this activation, resulting in lateralized motor output.


Title #1144: Increased doublecortin (DCX) expression and incidence of DCX-immunoreactive multipolar cells in the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb system of suicides.
PMID: 26082689

Abstract: Postmortem studies have confirmed the occurrence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans and implicated this process in antidepressant response, yet neurogenesis in other regions remains to be examined in the context of depression. Here we assess the extent of subventricular zone-olfactory bulb (SVZ-OB) neurogenesis in adult humans having died by suicide. Protein expression of proliferative and neurogenic markers Sox2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and doublecortin (DCX) were examined in postmortem SVZ and OB samples from depressed suicides and matched sudden-death controls. In the SVZ, DCX-immunoreactive (IR) cells displayed phenotypes typical of progenitors, whereas in the olfactory tract (OT), they were multipolar with variable size and morphologies suggestive of differentiating cells. DCX expression was significantly increased in the OB of suicides, whereas SVZ DCX expression was higher among unmedicated, but not antidepressant-treated, suicides. Although very few DCX-IR cells were present in the control OT, they were considerably more common in suicides and correlated with OB DCX levels. Suicides also displayed higher DCX-IR process volumes. These results support the notion that OB neurogenesis is minimal in adult humans. They further raise the possibility that the differentiation and migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts may be altered in unmedicated suicides, leading to an accumulation of ectopically differentiating cells in the OT. Normal SVZ DCX expression among suicides receiving antidepressants suggests a potentially novel mode of action of antidepressant medication. Given the modest group sizes and rarity of DCX-IR cells assessed here, a larger-scale characterization will be required before firm conclusions can be made regarding the identity of these cells.


Title #1145: Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal and Ivan Petrovic Pavlov: their parallel scientific lives, schools and nobel prizes.
PMID: 26082688
Authors: Jairo A JA. Rozo, Antonio A. RodrÃ­guez-Moreno
Abstract: Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal was not only a great scientist but he was also a dedicated teacher who managed to create his own School in Spain. Cajal was active at the end of the XIX and the beginning of the XX century, a period in which Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, another great contemporary scientist, also established a strong School in Russia. While these two acclaimed scientists shared a similar vision on science, a view they also conveyed to their disciples, they applied quite distinct criteria in the way they dealt with their followers. Interestingly, despite the geographic and idiomatic barriers that had to be overcome, the paths of these two great figures of XX century science crossed at least three times. First when they competed for the City of Moscow Prize, second when they both attended the "Congreso Internacional de Medicina de Madrid" (Medicine International Congress in Madrid) in 1903 and finally, they competed on four consecutive occasions for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Here we discuss their scientific vision, their different attitudes in the interaction with disciples and the distinct circumstances in which their paths crossed.


Title #1146: The identification and neurochemical characterization of central neurons that target parasympathetic preganglionic neurons involved in the regulation of choroidal blood flow in the rat eye using pseudorabies virus, immunolabeling and conventional pathway tracing methods.

Abstract: The choroidal blood vessels of the eye provide the main vascular support to the outer retina. These blood vessels are under parasympathetic vasodilatory control via input from the pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG), which in turn receives its preganglionic input from the superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) of the hindbrain. The present study characterized the central neurons projecting to the SSN neurons innervating choroidal PPG neurons, using pathway tracing and immunolabeling. In the initial set of studies, minute injections of the Bartha strain of the retrograde transneuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) were made into choroid in rats in which the superior cervical ganglia had been excised (to prevent labeling of sympathetic circuitry). Diverse neuronal populations beyond the choroidal part of ipsilateral SSN showed transneuronal labeling, which notably included the parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the periaqueductal gray, the raphe magnus (RaM), the B3 region of the pons, A5, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and the intermediate reticular nucleus of the medulla. The PRV+ neurons were located in the parts of these cell groups that are responsive to systemic blood pressure signals and involved in systemic blood pressure regulation by the sympathetic nervous system. In a second set of studies using PRV labeling, conventional pathway tracing, and immunolabeling, we found that PVN neurons projecting to SSN tended to be oxytocinergic and glutamatergic, RaM neurons projecting to SSN were serotonergic, and NTS neurons projecting to SSN were glutamatergic. Our results suggest that blood pressure and volume signals that drive sympathetic constriction of the systemic vasculature may also drive parasympathetic vasodilation of the choroidal vasculature, and may thereby contribute to choroidal baroregulation during low blood pressure.


Title #1147: When larger brains do not have more neurons: increased numbers of cells are compensated by decreased average cell size across mouse individuals.
PMID: 26082686

Abstract: There is a strong trend toward increased brain size in mammalian evolution, with larger brains composed of more and larger neurons than smaller brains across species within each mammalian order. Does the evolution of increased numbers of brain neurons, and thus larger brain size, occur simply through the selection of individuals with more and larger neurons, and thus larger brains, within a population? That is, do individuals with larger brains also have more, and larger, neurons than individuals with smaller brains, such that allometric relationships across species are simply an extension of intraspecific scaling? Here we show that this is not the case across adult male mice of a similar age. Rather, increased numbers of neurons across individuals are accompanied by increased numbers of other cells and smaller average cell size of both types, in a trade-off that explains how increased brain mass does not necessarily ensue. Fundamental regulatory mechanisms thus must exist that tie numbers of neurons to numbers of other cells and to average cell size within individual brains. Finally, our results indicate that changes in brain size in evolution are not an extension of individual variation in numbers of neurons, but rather occur through step changes that must simultaneously increase numbers of neurons and cause cell size to increase, rather than decrease.


Title #1148: Central plasticity and dysfunction elicited by aural deprivation in the critical period.
PMID: 26082685
Authors: Zhiji Z. Chen, Wei W. Yuan
Abstract: The acoustic signal is crucial for animals to obtain information from the surrounding environment. Like other sensory modalities, the central auditory system undergoes adaptive changes (i.e., plasticity) during the developmental stage as well as other stages of life. Owing to its plasticity, auditory centers may be susceptible to various factors, such as medical intervention, variation in ambient acoustic signals and lesion of the peripheral hearing organ. There are critical periods during which auditory centers are vulnerable to abnormal experiences. Particularly in the early postnatal development period, aural inputs are essential for functional maturity of auditory centers. An aural deprivation model, which can be achieved by attenuating or blocking the peripheral acoustic afferent input to the auditory center, is ideal for investigating plastic changes of auditory centers. Generally, auditory plasticity includes structural and functional changes, some of which can be irreversible. Aural deprivation can distort tonotopic maps, disrupt the binaural integration, reorganize the neural network and change the synaptic transmission in the primary auditory cortex or at lower levels of the auditory system. The regulation of specific gene expression and the modified signal pathway may be the deep molecular mechanism of these plastic changes. By studying this model, researchers may explore the pathogenesis of hearing loss and reveal plastic changes of the auditory cortex, facilitating the therapeutic advancement in patients with severe hearing loss. After summarizing developmental features of auditory centers in auditory deprived animals and discussing changes of central auditory remodeling in hearing loss patients, we aim at stressing the significant of an early and well-designed auditory training program for the hearing rehabilitation.


Title #1149: Purinergic signaling: a common pathway for neural and mesenchymal stem cell maintenance and differentiation.
PMID: 26082684
Authors: Fabio F. Cavaliere, Claudia C. Donno, Nadia N. D'Ambrosi
Abstract: Extracellular ATP, related nucleotides and adenosine are among the earliest signaling molecules, operating in virtually all tissues and cells. Through their specific receptors, namely purinergic P1 for nucleosides and P2 for nucleotides, they are involved in a wide array of physiological effects ranging from neurotransmission and muscle contraction to endocrine secretion, vasodilation, immune response, and fertility. The purinergic system also participates in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells from different niches. In particular, both mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells are endowed with several purinergic receptors and ecto-nucleotide metabolizing enzymes, and release extracellular purines that mediate autocrine and paracrine growth/proliferation, pro- or anti-apoptotic processes, differentiation-promoting effects and immunomodulatory actions. Here, we discuss the often opposing roles played by ATP and adenosine in adult neurogenesis in both physiological and pathological conditions, as well as in adipogenic and osteogenic MSC differentiation. We also focus on how purinergic ligands produced and released by transplanted stem cells can be regarded as ideal candidates to mediate the crosstalk with resident stem cell niches, promoting cell growth and survival, regulating inflammation and, therefore, contributing to local tissue homeostasis and repair.

Abstract: Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs of abuse. Tobacco smoking is a major cause of many health problems, and is the first preventable cause of death worldwide. Several findings show that nicotine exerts significant aversive as well as the well-known rewarding motivational effects. Less certain is the anatomical substrate that mediates or enables nicotine aversion. Here, we show that acute nicotine induces anxiogenic-like effects in rats at the doses investigated (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), as measured by the hole-board apparatus and manifested in behaviors such as decreased rearing and head-dipping and increased grooming. No changes in locomotor behavior were observed at any of the nicotine doses given. T-pattern analysis of the behavioral outcomes revealed a drastic reduction and disruption of complex behavioral patterns induced by all three nicotine doses, with the maximum effect for 1 mg/kg. Lesion of the lateral habenula (LHb) induced hyperlocomotion and, strikingly, reversed the nicotine-induced anxiety obtained at 1 mg/kg to an anxiolytic-like effect, as shown by T-pattern analysis. We suggest that the LHb is critically involved in emotional behavior states and in nicotine-induced anxiety, most likely through modulation of monoaminergic nuclei.


Title #1151: Chatting with the neighbors: crosstalk between Rho-kinase (ROCK) and other signaling pathways for treatment of neurological disorders.
PMID: 26082680
Authors: Niko N. Hensel, Sebastian S. Rademacher, Peter P. Claus
Abstract: ROCK inhibition has been largely applied as a strategy to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and promising results have been obtained in the recent years. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not fully understood and different models have been proposed for neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we aim to review the current knowledge obtained for NDDs identifying common mechanisms as well as disease-specific models. In addition to the role of ROCK in different cell types such as neurons and microglia, we focus on the molecular signaling-pathways which mediate the beneficial effects of ROCK. Besides canonical ROCK signaling, modulation of neighboring pathways by non-canonical ROCK-crosstalk is a recurrent pattern in many NDD-model systems and has been suggested to mediate beneficial effects of ROCK-inhibition.


Title #1152: Rapid cortical dynamics associated with auditory spatial attention gradients.
PMID: 26082679
Authors: Jeffrey R JR. Mock, Michael J MJ. Seay, Danielle R DR. Charney, John L JL. Holmes, Edward J EJ. Golob
Abstract: Behavioral and EEG studies suggest spatial attention is allocated as a gradient in which processing benefits decrease away from an attended location. Yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical processes that contribute to attentional gradients are unclear. We measured EEG while participants (n = 35) performed an auditory spatial attention task that required a button press to sounds at one target location on either the left or right. Distractor sounds were randomly presented at four non-target locations evenly spaced up to 180Â° from the target location. Attentional gradients were quantified by regressing ERP amplitudes elicited by distractors against their spatial location relative to the target. Independent component analysis was applied to each subject's scalp channel data, allowing isolation of distinct cortical sources. Results from scalp ERPs showed a tri-phasic response with gradient slope peaks at ~300 ms (frontal, positive), ~430 ms (posterior, negative), and a plateau starting at ~550 ms (frontal, positive). Corresponding to the first slope peak, a positive gradient was found within a central component when attending to both target locations and for two lateral frontal components when contralateral to the target location. Similarly, a central posterior component had a negative gradient that corresponded to the second slope peak regardless of target location. A right posterior component had both an ipsilateral followed by a contralateral gradient. Lateral posterior clusters also had decreases in Î± and Î² oscillatory power with a negative slope and contralateral tuning. Only the left posterior component (120-200 ms) corresponded to absolute sound location. The findings indicate a rapid, temporally-organized sequence of gradients thought to reflect interplay between frontal and parietal regions. We conclude these gradients support a target-based saliency map exhibiting aspects of both right-hemisphere dominance and opponent process models.


Title #1153: Enhanced Conformational Sampling Using Replica Exchange with Concurrent Solute Scaling and Hamiltonian Biasing Realized in One Dimension.
PMID: 26082676
Authors: Mingjun M. Yang, Jing J. Huang, Alexander D AD. MacKerell
Abstract: Replica exchange (REX) is a powerful computational tool for overcoming the quasi-ergodic sampling problem of complex molecular systems. Recently, several multidimensional extensions of this method have been developed to realize exchanges in both temperature and biasing potential space or the use of multiple biasing potentials to improve sampling efficiency. However, increased computational cost due to the multidimensionality of exchanges becomes challenging for use on complex systems under explicit solvent conditions. In this study, we develop a one-dimensional (1D) REX algorithm to concurrently combine the advantages of overall enhanced sampling from Hamiltonian solute scaling and the specific enhancement of collective variables using Hamiltonian biasing potentials. In the present Hamiltonian replica exchange method, termed HREST-BP, Hamiltonian solute scaling is applied to the solute subsystem, and its interactions with the environment to enhance overall conformational transitions and biasing potentials are added along selected collective variables associated with specific conformational transitions, thereby balancing the sampling of different hierarchical degrees of freedom. The two enhanced sampling approaches are implemented concurrently allowing for the use of a small number of replicas (e.g., 6 to 8) in 1D, thus greatly reducing the computational cost in complex system simulations. The present method is applied to conformational sampling of two nitrogen-linked glycans (N-glycans) found on the HIV gp120 envelope protein. Considering the general importance of the conformational sampling problem, HREST-BP represents an efficient procedure for the study of complex saccharides, and, more generally, the method is anticipated to be of general utility for the conformational sampling in a wide range of macromolecular systems.


Title #1154: Stacking in RNA: NMR of Four Tetramers Benchmark Molecular Dynamics.
PMID: 26082675
Authors: David E DE. Condon, Scott D SD. Kennedy, Brendan C BC. Mort, Ryszard R. Kierzek, Ilyas I. Yildirim, Douglas H DH. Turner
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for RNA tetramers r(AAAA), r(CAAU), r(GACC), and r(UUUU) are benchmarked against (1)H-(1)H NOESY distances and (3) J scalar couplings to test effects of RNA torsion parametrizations. Four different starting structures were used for r(AAAA), r(CAAU), and r(GACC), while five starting structures were used for r(UUUU). On the basis of X-ray structures, criteria are reported for quantifying stacking. The force fields, AMBER ff99, parmbsc0, parm99Ï_Yil, ff10, and parmTor, all predict experimentally unobserved stacks and intercalations, e.g., base 1 stacked between bases 3 and 4, and incorrect Ï, Ïµ, and sugar pucker populations. The intercalated structures are particularly stable, often lasting several microseconds. Parmbsc0, parm99Ï_Yil, and ff10 give similar agreement with NMR, but the best agreement is only 46%. Experimentally unobserved intercalations typically are associated with reduced solvent accessible surface area along with amino and hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to phosphate nonbridging oxygens. Results from an extensive set of MD simulations suggest that recent force field parametrizations improve predictions, but further improvements are necessary to provide reasonable agreement with NMR. In particular, intramolecular stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions may not be well balanced with the TIP3P water model. NMR data and the scoring method presented here provide rigorous benchmarks for future changes in force fields and MD methods.

Title #1158: Prognostic significance of ASXL1, JAK2V617F mutations and JAK2V617F allele burden in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.
PMID: 26082670
Authors: Ipek I. Yonal-Hindilerden, Aynur A. Daglar-Aday, Basak B. Akadam-Teker, Ceylan C. Yilmaz, Meliha M. Nalcaci, Akif Selim AS. Yavuz, Deniz D. Sargin
Abstract: Despite insights into the genetic basis of Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-negative MPNs), a significant proportion of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients present with no known MPN disease alleles. There were no previous studies investigating the impact of ASXL1 mutations in Ph-negative MPNs in Turkey. In the current study, we investigated the prognostic significance of ASXL1 mutations in Turkish MPN patients. We also aimed to determine the prognostic significance of JAK2V617F allele burden and the relationship of JAK2V617F mutation with ASXL1 mutations in Ph-negative MPNs.


Title #1159: Williams syndrome and its cognitive profile: the importance of eye movements.
PMID: 26082669
Authors: Jo J. Van Herwegen
Abstract: People with Williams syndrome (WS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 7, often show an uneven cognitive profile with participants performing better on language and face recognition tasks, in contrast to visuospatial and number tasks. Recent studies have shown that this specific cognitive profile in WS is a result of atypical developmental processes that interact with and affect brain development from infancy onward. Using examples from language, face processing, number, and visuospatial studies, this review evaluates current evidence from eye-tracking and developmental studies and argues that domain general processes, such as the ability to plan or execute saccades, influence the development of these domain-specific outcomes. Although more research on eye movements in WS is required, the importance of eye movements for cognitive development suggests a possible intervention pathway to improve cognitive abilities in this population.


Title #1160: Tyrosine levels are associated with insulin resistance in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PMID: 26082668
Authors: Miwa M. Kawanaka, Ken K. Nishino, Takahito T. Oka, Noriyo N. Urata, Jun J. Nakamura, Mitsuhiko M. Suehiro, Hirofumi H. Kawamoto, Yasutaka Y. Chiba, Gotaro G. Yamada
Abstract: Amino acid imbalance is often found in patients with cirrhosis, and this imbalance is associated with insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between amino acid imbalance and insulin resistance remains unclear. We evaluated serum amino acid concentrations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to determine if any of the levels of amino acids were associated with the biochemical markers and fibrosis stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).


Title #1161: Usability of a new disposable autoinjector platform device: results of a formative study conducted with a broad user population.
PMID: 26082667
Authors: Jakob J. Lange, Philipp P. Richard, Nick N. Bradley
Abstract: This article presents a late-stage formative usability study of an autoinjector platform device. Such devices are used for the subcutaneous delivery of biopharmaceuticals, primarily for self-administration by the patient. Previous usability work on autoinjectors reported in the literature has been specific to single indications. This study was instead conducted with a broad user population, defined to represent user characteristics across a range of indications. The goals of the study were to evaluate whether users could use the devices safely and effectively, and could understand the instructions for use (IFU) as well as the accompanying training. Further objectives were to capture any usability issues and to obtain participants' subjective ratings on the IFU and training as well as the confidence and comfort in using the device. A total of 43 participants in 5 groups received training and performed simulated injections either into an injection pad or a mannequin. All participants were able to successfully use the device. The device was well appreciated by all users, with a reported degree of confidence in using the device of 98%, of user comfort of 93%, and of comprehensibility of IFU and training of 98%. These values are higher than other comparable results reported in the literature. The presence of both audible and visible feedback during injection was seen to be a significant factor contributing to injection success. The observation that the device can be safely and efficiently used by all tested user groups provides confidence that the device and IFU in their current form will pass future summative testing in specific applications.


Title #1162: Randomized trial comparing episiotomies with Braun-Stadler episiotomy scissors and EPISCISSORS-60(Â®).
PMID: 26082666
Authors: Ganpat G. Sawant, Divya D. Kumar
Abstract: Episiotomy angle is a crucial factor in causation of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS), which are the major cause of female bowel incontinence. Sutured episiotomies angled too close to the midline (<30 degree) or too far away from the midline (>60 degree) fail to unload the perineum sufficiently and predispose to OASIS. A 25-degree post-delivery episiotomy suture angle has a 10% risk of OASIS while 45-degree episiotomy is associated with 0.5% risk. To account for perineal distension at crowning, a 60-degree episiotomy incision is required to achieve 43-50 degree suture angles. We compared episiotomy suture angles with commonly used Braun-Stadler episiotomy scissors with the new fixed angle EPISCISSORS-60(Â®).


Title #1163: Sclerostin inhibition: a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of osteoporosis.
PMID: 26082665
Authors: Arti D AD. Shah, Dolores D. Shoback, E Michael EM. Lewiecki
Abstract: Osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are growing problems with the aging population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. At this time, other than parathyroid hormone analogs, all therapies for osteoporosis are antiresorptive. Therefore, researchers have focused efforts on development of more anabolic therapies. Understanding of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is critical for skeletal development, and the role of sclerostin in inhibition of Wnt signaling has led to the discovery of a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of osteoporosis - sclerostin inhibition. In this review, we discuss the biology of Wnt signaling and sclerostin inhibition. We then discuss human disorders of decreased sclerostin function and animal models of sclerostin inhibition. Both have served to elucidate the effects of decreased sclerostin levels and function - increased bone mass and strength and fewer fractures. In addition, we review data from Phase I and II studies of the two humanized sclerostin monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab and blosozumab, both of which have had positive effects on bone mineral density. We conclude with a discussion of the ongoing Phase III studies of romosozumab. The available data support the potential for neutralizing sclerostin monoclonal antibodies to serve as anabolic agents in the treatment of osteoporosis.

Title #1167: New developments in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma - role of Belinostat.
PMID: 26082661
Authors: Peter P. Reimer
Abstract: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) represent a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies that with the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase expressing anaplastic large cell lymphoma, share a poor outcome after standard (eg, anthracycline-based) chemotherapy. Most patients are either refractory to initial therapy or eventually relapse. Randomized studies for relapsed/refractory PTCL are not available, however, recently published data show that conventional chemotherapy has very limited efficacy in the salvage setting. Thus, novel drugs are urgently needed to improve the outcome in this setting. Belinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, has demonstrated meaningful efficacy and a favorable toxicity profile in two single-arm Phase II trials on 153 patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL. The conclusive results led to an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. The present review summarizes the clinical data available for belinostat, its current role, and future perspectives.


Title #1168: Cancer therapy and cardiovascular risk: focus on bevacizumab.
PMID: 26082660
Authors: Panagiota P. Economopoulou, Athanasios A. Kotsakis, Ioannis I. Kapiris, Nikolaos N. Kentepozidis
Abstract: Recognition and management of treatment-related cardiovascular toxicity, defined as either an acute cardiac event or a chronic condition, has been tightly integrated into routine cancer care and has become an important component in treatment selection. Several chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines, are traditionally characterized as cardiotoxic, but cardiovascular adverse events are also associated with commonly used molecular targeted therapies. In the past decade, bevacizumab, a monoclonal humanized antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has been introduced in the treatment of a variety of metastatic malignancies. Despite its efficacy, bevacizumab has been associated with significant risk of cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, cardiac ischemia, and congestive heart failure. This review will focus on the cardiovascular toxicity of bevacizumab, providing the latest evidence on the incidence, clinical spectrum, risk factors, and responsible mechanisms.

Title #1170: Ramadan fasting and chronic kidney disease: does estimated glomerular filtration rate change after and before Ramadan? Insights from a mini meta-analysis.
PMID: 26082658
Authors: Nicola Luigi NL. Bragazzi
Abstract: Ramadan fasting represents one of the five pillars of the Islam creed. Even though patients are exempted from this religious duty, they may be eager to share this particular moment of the year with their family and peers, taking part in the intense spiritual ceremonies and events that characterize this month. However, there are no guidelines or standardized protocols that can help physicians to properly address the issue of patients with chronic kidney disease fasting in Ramadan and correctly advising them. For this purpose, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis to see whether glomerular filtration rate value changed before and after Ramadan. Our main findings are that: chronic kidney disease patients can safely fast during Ramadan since glomerular filtration rate does not change in a statistically significant way and, even though most studies have been carried out during Ramadan falling in cold seasons, the sensitivity analysis did not reveal any impact of seasonality. Further research in the field is needed.


Title #1171: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis of the 48 bp VNTR in the III exon of the DRD4 gene in a sample of parents of ADHD cases.
PMID: 26082657
Authors: Salvador S. Trejo, JosÃ© J JJ. Toscano-Flores, Esmeralda E. Matute, MarÃ­a de Lourdes Mde.L. RamÃ­rez-DueÃ±as
Abstract: The aim of this study was to obtain the genotype and gene frequency from parents of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and then assess the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotype frequency of the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) III exon of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene. The genotypes of the III exon of 48 bp VNTR repeats of the DRD4 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction in a sample of 30 parents of ADHD cases. In the 60 chromosomes analyzed, the following frequencies of DRD4 gene polymorphisms were observed: six chromosomes (c) with two repeat alleles (r) (10%); 1c with 3r (1.5%); 36c with 4r (60%); 1c with 5r (1.5%); and 16c with 7r (27%). The genotypic distribution of the 30 parents was two parents (p) with 2r/2r (6.67%); 1p with 2r/4r (3.33%); 1p with 2r/5r (3.33%); 1p with 3r/4r (3.33%); 15p with 4r/4r (50%); 4p with 4r/7r (13.33); and 6p with 7r/7r (20%). A Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (Ï (2)=13.03, P<0.01) was found due to an over-representation of the 7r/7r genotype. These results suggest that the 7r polymorphism of the DRD4 gene is associated with the ADHD condition in a Mexican population.

Title #1174: Evolution of health technology assessment: best practices of the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review.
PMID: 26082654
Authors: Angela A. Rocchi, Isabelle I. Chabot, Judith J. Glennie
Abstract: In 2007, Canada chose to develop a separate and distinct path for oncology drug health technology assessment (HTA). In 2013, the decision was made to transfer the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), to align the pCODR and CADTH Common Drug Review processes while building on the best practices of both. The objective of this research was to conduct an examination of the best practices established by the pCODR.

Abstract: Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a new triazole recently approved for the treatment of onychomycosis. It inhibits fungal lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, has potent antifungal activity against dermatophytes, as well as activity against Candida spp. and non-dermatophyte molds, and showed promising results in clinical trials. This review summarizes the mechanism of action, in vitro and in vivo data, clinical trials, safety, and quality-of-life data of efinaconazole as it applies to the treatment of onychomycosis.


Title #1177: Tools for visualization and analysis of molecular networks, pathways, and -omics data.
PMID: 26082651
Authors: Jose M JM. Villaveces, Prasanna P. Koti, Bianca H BH. Habermann
Abstract: Biological pathways have become the standard way to represent the coordinated reactions and actions of a series of molecules in a cell. A series of interconnected pathways is referred to as a biological network, which denotes a more holistic view on the entanglement of cellular reactions. Biological pathways and networks are not only an appropriate approach to visualize molecular reactions. They have also become one leading method in -omics data analysis and visualization. Here, we review a set of pathway and network visualization and analysis methods and take a look at potential future developments in the field.


Title #1178: Elevated pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels and platelet counts predict poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
PMID: 26082650
Authors: Peng P. Liu, Yuan Y. Zhu, Luying L. Liu
Abstract: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic significance of the preoperative plasma D-dimer levels and platelet counts in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A total of 168 consecutive locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured by a latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Of the 168 patients enrolled, 106 patients were males and 62 patients were females. There was significant difference between plasma D-dimer levels and clinical responses (P=0.001). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year cumulative overall survival rates were 50.6%, 15.0%, and 4.9%, respectively. Plasma D-dimer levels (P<0.001) and platelet counts (P=0.010) were significantly related with overall survival in univariate analysis. The Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that plasma D-dimer levels (P=0.028), platelet counts (P=0.004), and treatment response (P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Elevated pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels and platelet counts predict poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


Title #1179: The role of Nanog expression in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells.
PMID: 26082649
Authors: Khalid K. Arif, Issam I. Hussain, Carol C. Rea, Mohamed M. El-Sheemy
Abstract: There is an accumulation of evidence that shows a significant role of cancer stem cells in tumor initiation, proliferation, relapse, and metastasis. Nanog is the most important core transcription marker of stem cells, known by its role in maintaining pluripotency, proliferation, and differentiation. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the role of Nanog in breast cancer cell tamoxifen resistance and its implications in breast cancer treatment. In this study, the expression of the three core transcription markers Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2 were quantitatively evaluated using flow cytometry. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against human Nanog was transfected into tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells via Lipofectamine 2000. Nanog gene expression in the cells was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The change in cell proliferation was evaluated using the tetrazolium bromide method. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect apoptosis of the transfected cells alone and in combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The results showed a high level expression of Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2 in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7/tamoxifen resistant cells compared with MCF7/wild-type. siRNA-mediated Nanog gene silencing can efficiently inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. This study provides a basis for further study of the role of Nanog in developing resistance to tamoxifen, its implication in breast cancer management, and as a new strategy to enhance response to endocrine therapy.


Title #1180: Alectinib for choroidal metastasis in a patient with crizotinib-resistant ALK rearranged positive non-small cell lung cancer.
PMID: 26082648
Authors: Yusuke Y. Okuma, Yuichiro Y. Tanaka, Tina T. Kamei, Yukio Y. Hosomi, Tatsuru T. Okamura
Abstract: Choroidal metastasis is rare in cancer patients. Small molecules of molecular targeted agents for lung cancer with actionable mutations were reported to be palliated for symptoms caused by choroidal metastasis. Visual disturbance by choroidal metastasis significantly decreases quality of life during the patient's remaining lifespan; therefore, radiotherapy or laser photocoagulation is proposed with consensus. However, improvement in survival with matched molecular targeted agents for oncogenic driver mutations reminds us to also be concerned with late treatment toxicities. A 30-year-old female patient previously treated with crizotinib harboring ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer complained of visual disturbance, fever, and bone pains undergoing anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. A decreased proportion of ALK fusion was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in liver metastasis compared to the primary site in a chemo-naÃ¯ve state. She was diagnosed with low vision, choroidal metastasis and retinal detachment. Therefore, she started alectinib treatment and both her ocular and systemic symptoms were palliated in a week. Later, she temporarily discontinued alectinib because of skin rash although the choroidal metastasis and retinal detachment resolved and she regained low vision completely at 2 weeks. She obtained partial response with alectinib for more than 5 months after recovering from skin rash.

Title #1182: Sudden bilateral hearing loss in gastric cancer as the only symptom of disease.
PMID: 26082646
Authors: Zoran Z. Rakusic, Ana Misir AM. Krpan, Darija Stupin DS. Polancec, Antonia A. Jakovcevic, Vesna V. Bisof
Abstract: This paper reports a case of sudden bilateral deafness as the first symptom of gastric cancer, an extremely rare and atypical clinical situation. Because common signs of stomach cancer were absent, the patient was first evaluated in the Department of Otolaryngology, University Hospital Center, Zagreb. Only after expanded diagnostic evaluation and rapid progression of the disease in such a case is a malignant tumor suspected. Treatment is mostly ineffective. The unusual presentation of the disease and the rapid course may indicate a hereditary predisposition. Inactivation of tumor suppressor gene DFNA5 was found in 50% of gastric cancers, but of a non-metastasized phenotype. Inactivated DFNA5, otherwise described in hereditary bilateral deafness, perhaps favors the development of deafness in patients with gastric cancer. Our patient had a positive multiple viral antibody titer in serum, inactivated DFNA5 in both gastric cancer tissues and cerebellar metastases, and a metastatic form of the disease. If sudden deafness occurs in elderly patients, the possibility of malignant tumor should be taken into consideration. The link between gastric cancer and the DFNA5 gene is unclear and requires further research.


Title #1183: Clinical utility and patient consideration in the use of lenalidomide for multiple myeloma in Chinese patients.
PMID: 26082645
Authors: Jing J. Wang, Hongfeng H. Guo, Xin X. Zhou
Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematologic malignancy caused by the autonomous growth of malignant plasma cells. In the last decade, the introduction of novel targeted agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide has dramatically improved the clinical outcome of MM patients in both the frontline and recurrent settings. Lenalidomide is a synthetic derivative of thalidomide, which has been shown to significantly improve overall survival, time to progression, and overall response rates in patients with MM. The China Food and Drug Administration approved the use of lenalidomide in patients with MM in 2013. In a Phase II trial, lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was associated with a high response rate and acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory MM, including those with renal impairment and IgD subtype. However, lenalidomide will remain as a second-line antimyeloma drug in the near future because of its high price and the policy of health insurance reimbursement in People's Republic of China. In this review, we summarize the clinical utility and patient considerations in the use of lenalidomide for MM in Chinese patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to investigate the better quality, longer duration, and more clinically meaningful outcomes of lenalidomide in the treatment of MM in Chinese patients.


Title #1184: Combination of icotinib, surgery, and internal-radiotherapy of a patient with lung cancer severely metastasized to the vertebrae bones with EGFR mutation: a case report.
PMID: 26082644
Authors: Li-Li LL. Qu, Hai-Feng HF. Qin, Hong-Jun HJ. Gao, Xiao-Qing XQ. Liu
Abstract: A 48-year-old Chinese female was referred to us regarding EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and metastasis to left scapula and vertebrae bones which caused pathological fracture at T8 and T10 thoracic vertebrae. An aggressive combined therapy with icotinib, vertebrae operation, and radioactive particle implantation and immunotherapy was proposed to prevent paraplegia, relieve pain, and control the overall and local tumor lesions. No postoperative symptoms were seen after surgery, and the pain was significantly relieved. Icotinib merited a 31-month partial response with grade 1 diarrhea as its drug-related adverse event. High dose of icotinib was administered after pelvis lesion progression for 3 months with good tolerance. Combination therapy of icotinib, surgery, and internal radiation for metastases of the vertebrae bones from non-small cell lung cancer seems to be a very promising technique both for sufficient pain relief and for local control of the tumor, vertebrae operation can be an encouraging option for patients with EFGR positive mutation and good prognosis indicator.

Title #1187: High-flow bypass and wrap-clipping for ruptured blood blister-like aneurysm of the internal carotid artery using intraoperative monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics.
PMID: 26082641
Authors: Yoshitaka Y. Kubo, Takahiro T. Koji, Kenji K. Yoshida, Hideo H. Saito, Akira A. Ogawa, Kuniaki K. Ogasawara
Abstract: Aneurysms at non-branching sites in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) can be classified as "blood blister-like aneurysms" (BBAs), which have blood blister-like configurations and fragile walls. While surgical treatment for the BBA in the acute stage is recommended, the optimal surgical procedure remains controversial. In the study reported here, we describe the case of a 37-year-old woman with a ruptured BBA in the ophthalmic segment of the right ICA who underwent wrap-clipping with external carotid artery-internal carotid artery bypass by intraoperative estimation of the measurement of cortical cerebral blood flow (CoBF) using a thermal diffusion flow probe. Trapping of the ICA in the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in ischemic complications secondary to hemodynamic hypoperfusion or occlusion of the perforating artery, and/or delayed vasospasm, even with concomitant bypass surgery. We believe that it is important to perform scheduled external carotid artery-internal carotid artery bypass before trapping of the ICA in patients with a ruptured BBA in the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage and to perform wrap-clipping rather than trapping. This would provide much more CoBF if a reduction of CoBF occurs after trapping occlusion of the ICA including a ruptured BBA according to intraoperative CoBF monitoring. As far as we are aware, the case reported here is the first report on high-flow bypass and wrap-clipping for a ruptured BBA of the ICA using intraoperative monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics.


Title #1188: Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors: clinical potential in heart failure and beyond.
PMID: 26082640
Authors: Jagdeep Ss JS. Singh, Chim C CC. Lang
Abstract: Heart failure remains a major concern across the globe as life expectancies and delivery of health care continue to improve. There has been a dearth of new developments in heart failure therapies in the last decade until last year, with the release of the results from the PARADIGM-HF Trial heralding the arrival of a promising new class of drug, ie, the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. In this review, we discuss the evolution of our incremental understanding of the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure, which has led to our success in modulating its various pathways. We start by examining the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, followed by the challenges of modulating the natriuretic peptide system. We then delve deeper into the pharmacology and mechanisms by which angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors achieve their significant cardiovascular benefits. Finally, we also consider the potential application of this new class of drug in other areas, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, patients with renal impairment, and following myocardial infarction.

Title #1191: Triptolide attenuates cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats through the inhibition the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.
PMID: 26082636
Authors: Xiao-Qing XQ. Jin, Fei F. Ye, Jun-Jian JJ. Zhang, Yan Y. Zhao, Xian-Long XL. Zhou
Abstract: Inflammation plays critical roles in the acute progression of the pathology of ischemic injury. Previous studies have shown that triptolide interferes with a number of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether triptolide has protective effects during acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Male Sprague Dawley rats received triptolide or vehicle at the onset of reperfusion following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, we evaluated neurological injuries, the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, and NF-ÎºB activation. I/R rats treated with triptolide showed significantly better neurological deficit scores, decreased neural apoptosis, and reduced cerebral infarct volume and brain edema, and triptolide treatment suppressed the activation of NF-ÎºB following I/R injury. Furthermore, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at both the mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in rats receiving triptolide. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effects of triptolide during acute cerebral I/R injury are possibly related to the inhibition of both the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and inflammation.

Abstract: Cadherin13 (CDH13) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in morphogenesis and the maintenance of neuronal circuitry. CDH13 has been implicated in the susceptibility to a variety of psychiatric diseases. A recent genome-wide association study using Danish samples showed, for the first time, the involvement of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CDH13 (intronic SNP rs8057927) in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated the association between other SNPs of CDH13 and schizophrenia and tried to replicate the association for the SNP of rs8057927, in the Japanese population.


Title #1193: Magnetic nanoparticles enhance the anticancer activity of cathelicidin LL-37 peptide against colon cancer cells.
PMID: 26082634

Abstract: The pleiotropic activity of human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide includes an ability to suppress development of colon cancer cells. We hypothesized that the anticancer activity of LL-37 would improve when attached to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Using colon cancer culture (DLD-1 cells and HT-29 cells), we evaluated the effects of MNPs, LL-37 peptide, its synthetic analog ceragenin CSA-13, and two novel nanosystems, ie, MNP@LL-37 and MNP@CSA-13, on cancer cell viability and apoptosis. Treatment of cancer cells with the LL-37 peptide linked to MNPs (MNP@LL-37) caused a greater decrease in cell viability and a higher rate of apoptosis compared with treatment using free LL-37 peptide. Additionally, we observed a strong ability of ceragenin CSA-13 and MNP@CSA-13 to induce apoptosis of DLD-1 cells. We found that both nanosystems were successfully internalized by HT-29 cells, and cathelicidin LL-37 and ceragenin CSA-13 might play a key role as novel homing molecules. These results indicate that the previously described anticancer activity of LL-37 peptide against colon cancer cells might be significantly improved using a theranostic approach.


Title #1194: Transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide- chitosan functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes as a potential drug delivery vehicle for cancer therapy.
PMID: 26082633
Authors: Xia X. Dong, Lanxia L. Liu, Dunwan D. Zhu, Hailing H. Zhang, Xigang X. Leng
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based drug delivery vehicles might find great potential in cancer therapy via the combination of chemotherapy with photothermal therapy due to the strong optical absorbance of CNTs in the near-infrared region. However, the application of CNTs in cancer therapy was considerably constrained by their lack of solubility in aqueous medium, as well as the cytotoxicity caused by their hydrophobic surface. Intracellular delivery efficiency is another factor determining the application potential of CNTs in cancer therapy. In the present study, low-molecular-weight chitosan conjugated with transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide was used for noncovalent functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), aiming at providing a more efficient drug delivery vehicle for cancer therapy. The TAT-chitosan-conjugated MWCNTs (MWCNTs-TC) were further investigated for their water solubility, cytotoxicity, cell-penetrating capability, and accumulation in tumor. It was found that MWCNTs-TC were essentially nontoxic with satisfying water solubility, and they were more efficient in terms of cancer-targeted intracellular transport both in vitro and in vivo as compared with chitosan-modified MWCNTs (MWCNTs-CS), suggesting the great application potential of MWCNTs-TC in cancer therapy.


Title #1195: Mesoporous bioactive glass surface modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) electrospun fibrous scaffold for bone regeneration.
PMID: 26082632

Abstract: A mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) surface modified with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) electrospun fibrous scaffold for bone regeneration was prepared by dip-coating a PLGA electrospun fibrous scaffold into MBG precursor solution. Different surface structures and properties were acquired by different coating times. Surface morphology, chemical composition, microstructure, pore size distribution, and hydrophilicity of the PLGA-MBG scaffold were characterized. Results of scanning electron microscopy indicated that MBG surface coating made the scaffold rougher with the increase of MBG content. Scaffolds after MBG modification possessed mesoporous architecture on the surface. The measurements of the water contact angles suggested that the incorporation of MBG into the PLGA scaffold improved the surface hydrophilicity. An energy dispersive spectrometer evidenced that calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite formed on the PLGA-MBG scaffolds after a 7-day immersion in simulated body fluid. In vitro studies showed that the incorporation of MBG favored cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells on the PLGA scaffolds. Moreover, the MBG surface-modified PLGA (PLGA-MBG) scaffolds were shown to be capable of providing the improved adsorption/release behaviors of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). It is very significant that PLGA-MBG scaffolds could be effective for BMP-2 delivery and bone regeneration.


Title #1196: Gold nanoparticles allow detection of early-stage edema in mice via computed tomography imaging.
PMID: 26082631
Authors: Jenny J. Domey, Ulf U. TeichgrÃ¤ber, Ingrid I. Hilger
Abstract: Due to their high X-ray attenuation, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) emerged as preclinical contrast agents by giving high vasculature contrast. For this reason, GNPs are regularly applied for computed tomography (CT) imaging of tumors but not for the visualization of inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility and applicability of preclinical GNPs (AuroVistâ¢) of two different sizes (1.9 nm and 15 nm) for the detection of inflammation-associated phagocytes in early-stage edema. Both GNP variants were stable under in vitro conditions and achieved high micro-CT (mCT) contrast after embedment into agarose. Fifteen-nanometer GNPs were detected after uptake into macrophages via mCT imaging exhibiting higher X-ray contrast than cells treated with 1.9 nm GNPs and untreated ones. Both 1.9 nm and 15 nm GNPs exhibited good biocompatibility on murine macrophages according to ATP and cellular dehydrogenase levels. Reactive oxygen species levels produced by phagocytic cells decreased significantly (Pâ¤0.05) after co-incubation with GNPs regardless of the size of the nanoparticle (NP) in comparison to untreated control cells. In vivo mCT studies of inflammation imaging revealed that GNPs with a diameter of 15 nm accumulated within subcutaneous edema 2 hours after injection with a maximum signaling 8 hours postinjection and could be detected up to 48 hours within the edema region. In contrast, 1.9 nm GNPs were not shown to accumulate at the site of the inflammation region and were mostly excreted via the renal system 2-4 hours after injection. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that both GNP variants (1.9 nm and 15 nm) were stable and biocompatible under in vitro conditions. However, only 15 nm NPs have the potential as contrast agent for phagocyte labeling and applications in CT imaging of inflammation on a cellular level.


Title #1197: Magnetic resonance imaging of folic acid-coated magnetite nanoparticles reflects tissue biodistribution of long-acting antiretroviral therapy.
PMID: 26082630

Abstract: Regimen adherence, systemic toxicities, and limited drug penetrance to viral reservoirs are obstacles limiting the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our laboratory's development of the monocyte-macrophage-targeted long-acting nanoformulated ART (nanoART) carriage provides a novel opportunity to simplify drug-dosing regimens. Progress has nonetheless been slowed by cumbersome, but required, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution testing. To this end, we developed a small magnetite ART (SMART) nanoparticle platform to assess antiretroviral drug tissue biodistribution and PK using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Herein, we have taken this technique a significant step further by determining nanoART PK with folic acid (FA) decorated magnetite (ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide [USPIO]) particles and by using SMART particles. FA nanoparticles enhanced the entry and particle retention to the reticuloendothelial system over nondecorated polymers after systemic administration into mice. These data were seen by MRI testing and validated by comparison with SMART particles and direct evaluation of tissue drug levels after nanoART. The development of alendronate (ALN)-coated magnetite thus serves as a rapid initial screen for the ability of targeting ligands to enhance nanoparticle-antiretroviral drug biodistribution, underscoring the value of decorated magnetite particles as a theranostic tool for improved drug delivery.

Abstract: Triple combination therapy involving long-acting muscarinic antagonists long-acting Î²2 agonists, and inhaled corticosteroids has recently become an option for maintenance treatment of COPD. Some add-on clinical trials have reported the benefits of these combinations. However, the process to step up to triple therapy varies for individual cases.


Title #1199: Important, misunderstood, and challenging: a qualitative study of nurses' and allied health professionals' perceptions of implementing self-management for patients with COPD.
PMID: 26082628
Authors: Hannah Ml HM. Young, Lindsay D LD. Apps, Samantha L SL. Harrison, Vicki L VL. Johnson-Warrington, Nicky N. Hudson, Sally J SJ. Singh
Abstract: In light of the growing burden of COPD, there is increasing focus on the role of self-management for this population. Currently, self-management varies widely. Little is known either about nurses' and allied health professionals' (AHPs') understanding and provision of self-management in clinical practice. This study explores nurses' and AHPs' understanding and implementation of supported COPD self-management within routine clinical practice.

Authors: Nanshan N. Zhong, Changzheng C. Wang, Xiangdong X. Zhou, Nuofu N. Zhang, Michael M. Humphries, Linda L. Wang, Chau C. Thach, Francesco F. Patalano, Donald D. Banerji
Abstract: The current Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) treatment strategy recommends the use of one or more bronchodilators according to the patient's airflow limitation, their history of exacerbations, and symptoms. The LANTERN study evaluated the effect of the long-acting Î²2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) dual bronchodilator, QVA149 (indacaterol/glycopyrronium), as compared with the LABA/inhaled corticosteroid, salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC), in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD with a history of â¤1 exacerbation in the previous year.


Title #1203: Novel aspects of pathogenesis and regeneration mechanisms in COPD.
PMID: 26082624
Authors: Edvardas E. Bagdonas, Jovile J. Raudoniute, Ieva I. Bruzauskaite, Ruta R. Aldonyte
Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide, is characterized by expiratory airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, deregulated chronic inflammation, and emphysematous destruction of the lungs. Despite the fact that COPD is a steadily growing global healthcare problem, the conventional therapies remain palliative, and regenerative approaches for disease management are not available yet. We aim to provide an overview of key reviews, experimental, and clinical studies addressing lung emphysema development and repair mechanisms published in the past decade. Novel aspects discussed herein include integral revision of the literature focused on lung microflora changes in COPD, autoimmune component of the disease, and environmental risk factors other than cigarette smoke. The time span of studies on COPD, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthmatic bronchitis, covers almost 200 years, and several crucial mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis are described and studied. However, we still lack the holistic understanding of COPD development and the exact picture of the time-course and interplay of the events during stable, exacerbated, corticosteroid-treated COPD states, and transitions in-between. Several generally recognized mechanisms will be discussed shortly herein, ie, unregulated inflammation, proteolysis/antiproteolysis imbalance, and destroyed repair mechanisms, while novel topics such as deviated microbiota, air pollutants-related damage, and autoimmune process within the lung tissue will be discussed more extensively. Considerable influx of new data from the clinic, in vivo and in vitro studies stimulate to search for novel concise explanation and holistic understanding of COPD nowadays.


Title #1204: Prognostic factors for clinical failure of exacerbations in elderly outpatients with moderate-to-severe COPD.
PMID: 26082623
Authors: Robert R. Wilson, Antonio A. Anzueto, Marc M. Miravitlles, Pierre P. Arvis, Daniel D. Haverstock, Mila M. Trajanovic, Sanjay S. Sethi
Abstract: Acute exacerbations represent a significant burden for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each exacerbation episode is frequently associated with a lengthy recovery and impaired quality of life. Prognostic factors for outpatients that may predict poor outcome after treatment with antibiotics recommended in the guidelines, are not fully understood. We aimed to identify pretherapy factors predictive of clinical failure in elderly (â¥60 years old) outpatients with acute Anthonisen type 1 exacerbations.


Title #1205: Epidemiology and management of chronic constipation in elderly patients.
PMID: 26082622
Authors: Maria Vazquez MV. Roque, Ernest P EP. Bouras
Abstract: Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, with prevalence in the general population of approximately 20%. In the elderly population the incidence of constipation is higher compared to the younger population, with elderly females suffering more often from severe constipation. Treatment options for chronic constipation (CC) include stool softeners, fiber supplements, osmotic and stimulant laxatives, and the secretagogues lubiprostone and linaclotide. Understanding the underlying etiology of CC is necessary to determine the most appropriate therapeutic option. Therefore, it is important to distinguish from pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD), slow and normal transit constipation. Evaluation of a patient with CC includes basic blood work, rectal examination, and appropriate testing to evaluate for PFD and slow transit constipation when indicated. Pelvic floor rehabilitation or biofeedback is the treatment of choice for PFD, and its efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. Surgery is rarely indicated in CC and can only be considered in cases of slow transit constipation when PFD has been properly excluded. Other treatment options such as sacral nerve stimulation seem to be helpful in patients with urinary dysfunction. Botulinum toxin injection for PFD cannot be recommended at this time with the available evidence. CC in the elderly is common, and it has a significant impact on quality of life and the use of health care resources. In the elderly, it is imperative to identify the etiology of CC, and treatment should be based on the patient's overall clinical status and capabilities.


Title #1206: Patient considerations in the treatment of cervical dystonia: focus on botulinum toxin type A.
PMID: 26082621
Authors: Reversa R RR. Mills, Fernando L FL. Pagan
Abstract: Cervical dystonia is the most common form of focal dystonia characterized by involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal movements and posturing of the head and neck and is associated with significant pain. Botulinum toxin is considered first-line therapy in the treatment of pain and abnormal head posturing associated with cervical dystonia. There are currently three botulinum toxin type A neurotoxins and one botulinum type B neurotoxin commercially available and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeled for the treatment of cervical dystonia. This review will focus on the efficacy, safety, and therapeutic use of botulinum type A neurotoxins in the treatment of cervical dystonia. We conclude with a discussion of factors influencing toxin selection including therapeutic effect, duration of effect, side effect profile, cost, and physician preference.


Title #1207: Profile of paliperidone palmitate once-monthly long-acting injectable in the management of schizophrenia: long-term safety, efficacy, and patient acceptability - a review.
PMID: 26082620
Authors: Alexandre A. GonzÃ¡lez-RodrÃ­guez, Rosa R. CatalÃ¡n, Rafael R. PenadÃ©s, Clemente C. Garcia-Rizo, Miquel M. Bioque, Eduard E. Parellada, Miquel M. Bernardo
Abstract: Short-term studies focused on once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP) at doses of 25 mg eq, 50 mg eq, 75 mg eq, 100 mg eq, or 150 mg eq have shown its efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of schizophrenia patients. However, few open-label and long-term studies are available regarding this new pharmacological formulation. Thus, our main aim was to review the scientific evidence on efficacy, safety, tolerability, and preference of PP in these populations.


Title #1208: Profile of ceftolozane/tazobactam and its potential in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
PMID: 26082619
Authors: Marion J MJ. Skalweit
Abstract: Drug-resistant pathogens have gained a foothold especially in the most vulnerable patient populations, hospitalized and immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing organisms are finding their way even into the community, with patients presenting to the hospital with established colonization and infection with resistant Enterobacteriaceae in particular. Recently, a novel antipseudomonal cephalosporin in combination with an established Class A Î²-lactamase inhibitor, ceftolozane/tazobactam has been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. Ceftolozane is a uniquely potent antipseudomonal cephalosporin because of its high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its low affinity for the intrinsic Class C Î²-lactamases of P. aeruginosa, its ability to enter P. aeruginosa through the outer membrane without the utilization of OprD protein, and the fact that it is not a substrate of the often upregulated MexAB/OprM efflux system of P. aeruginosa. The biological chemistry, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, microbiologic spectrum, and clinical trials that led to the approval of ceftolozane is reviewed. A discussion regarding its potential role in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and other infectious disease syndromes associated with drug-resistant pathogens follows.


Title #1209: Spotlight on pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma.
PMID: 26082618
Authors: Thanashan T. Rajakulendran, David N DN. Adam
Abstract: Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Many approved therapies often do not achieve durable responses in patients. This underscores the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Recruiting a robust immune response is an important antineoplastic treatment strategy. Immune checkpoints offer a molecular target for modulating the immune response and a promising therapeutic target in metastatic melanoma. Here we discuss the recent approval of pembrolizumab by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and its impact on future management of the disease.


Title #1210: Protective effect of Huang Gan formula in 5/6 nephrectomized rats by depressing the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Huang Gan formula (HGF) is a new traditional Chinese herbal medicine created according to the basic theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of HGF on chronic kidney disease and determine the mechanisms of action. The extract of HGF was prepared, and qualitative and quantitative determination of phytochemical was performed with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer and high-performance liquid chromatography. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=72) were submitted to 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx), and then respectively treated with uremic clearance granule, losartan, HGF low dose, HGF middle dose, and HGF high dose once per day for 12 weeks. The sham group of operated rats (n=22) was treated with normal saline or HGF middle dose as a background control group. Blood and urine biochemical parameters, renal tissue morphology, and mRNA and proteins of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathways were investigated. The results showed that the quality of the extraction process could be controlled, and a total of eight major compounds were identified and quantified. HGF could decrease the level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine protein and increase the renal index and creatinine clearance rate in a dose-dependent manner. HGF also remarkably reduced the glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis by blocking the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway through inhibiting the Wnt1, Î²-catenin, transcription factor 4, and fibronectin 1 expressions, simultaneously measured through mRNA and protein levels in the remnant kidney. These results suggest that extraction of HGF could improve remnant renal function and possibly ameliorate glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis by depressing the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.


Title #1211: Clinicopathological significance and potential drug target of RUNX3 in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.
PMID: 26082616
Authors: Lijun L. Xu, Hongwen H. Lan, Yushu Y. Su, Jun J. Li, Jingwen J. Wan
Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that RUNX3 is a candidate tumor suppressor in several types of human tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the correlation between RUNX3 hypermethylation and clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC remains unclear. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the effects of RUNX3 hypermethylation on the incidence of NSCLC and clinicopathological characteristics.

Abstract: The study reported here compared the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy of fimasartan alone with that of fimasartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination in patients whose BP goal was not achieved after 4 weeks of treatment with once-daily fimasartan 60 mg.


Title #1213: Cost-effectiveness analysis of lamivudine, telbivudine, and entecavir in treatment of chronic hepatitis B with adefovir dipivoxil resistance.
PMID: 26082614
Authors: Guiliang G. Wang, Yan Y. Liu, Ping P. Qiu, Shu-Feng SF. Zhou, Linfang L. Xu, Ping P. Wen, Jianbo J. Wen, Xianzhong X. Xiao
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of lamivudine (LMV), telbivudine (LdT), and entecavir (ETV) in treatment of chronic hepatitis B with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) resistance. Two hundred and fifty-two patients were recruited and screened for resistance to ADV and randomly assigned into three groups: LMV + ADV, LdT + ADV, and ETV + ADV. The ratio of biochemical response, virological response, seroconversion of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)/hepatitis Be antibody (HBeAb), viral breakthrough, and the cost and effectiveness of treatments were analyzed. A comparison of the results of the ratio of biochemical response, virological response and seroconversion of HBeAg/HBeAb, showed no statistical difference between the three groups, with the economic cost of LMV + ADV the lowest, LdT + ADV the middle, and ETV + ADV the highest. The side effects of the three plans are all rare and tolerable. LMV + ADV is the optimal rescue strategy, and LdT + ADV the alternative selection in the economically less developed regions, while ETV + ADV was used in the economically developed regions.


Title #1214: Applications of calixarenes in cancer chemotherapy: facts and perspectives.
PMID: 26082613
Authors: Ali A. Yousaf, Shafida Abd SA. Hamid, Noraslinda M NM. Bunnori, A A AA. Ishola
Abstract: Research on the therapeutic applications of calixarene derivatives is an emerging area of interest. The anticancer activity of various functionalized calixarenes has been reported by several research groups. Due to their superior geometric shape, calixarenes can accommodate drug molecules by forming inclusion complexes. Controlled release of anticancer drugs by calixarenes might help in targeted chemotherapy. This review summarizes the anticancer potential of the calixarenes and their drug loading properties. The potential use of calixarenes in chemoradiotherapy is also highlighted in brief.


Title #1215: Neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of ghrelin in an experimental glaucoma model.
PMID: 26082612
Authors: Nagehan N. Can, Onur O. Catak, Burak B. Turgut, Tamer T. Demir, Nevin N. Ilhan, Tuncay T. Kuloglu, Ibrahim Hanifi IH. Ozercan
Abstract: Damage to retinal ganglion cells due to elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is responsible for vision loss in glaucoma. Given that loss of these cells is irreversible, neuroprotection is crucial in the treatment of glaucoma. In this study, we investigated the possible antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of ghrelin on the retina in an experimental glaucoma model. Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three groups comprising seven rats each. The rats in the control group were not operated on and did not receive any treatment. In all rats in the other groups, IOP was increased by cauterization of the limbal veins. After creation of the IOP increase, saline 1 mL/kg or ghrelin 40 Î¼g/kg was administered intraperitoneally every day for 14 days in the vehicle control group and ghrelin groups, respectively. On day 14 of the study, the eyes were enucleated. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) in anterior chamber fluid were measured. The retinas were subjected to immunohistochemistry staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100, and vimentin expression. Mean levels of MDA, NO, and NOS2 in the aqueous humor were higher in the vehicle control group than in the control group (P<0.05). Mean levels of MDA, NO, and NOS2 in the ghrelin group did not show a significant increase compared with levels in the control group (P>0.05). Retinal TUNEL and immunohistochemistry staining in the vehicle control group showed an increase in apoptosis and expression of GFAP, S-100, and vimentin compared with the control group (P<0.05). In the ghrelin group, apoptosis and expression of GFAP, S-100, and vimentin was significantly lower than in the vehicle control group (P<0.05). This study suggests that ghrelin has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on the retina in an experimental glaucoma model.


Title #1216: Bioequivalence evaluation of two amlodipine salts, besylate and orotate, each in a fixed-dose combination with olmesartan in healthy subjects.
PMID: 26082611
Authors: Soo-Yun SY. Lee, Jung-Ryul JR. Kim, Jin Ah JA. Jung, Wooseong W. Huh, Mi Young MY. Bahng, Jae-Wook JW. Ko
Abstract: A fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and olmesartan is used to treat high blood pressure in patients whose hypertension is not sufficiently controlled with either drug alone. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence of two fixed-dose combinations, ie, amlodipine orotate/olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg and amlodipine besylate/olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg, in healthy subjects. A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-sequence, two-period, crossover study was conducted in 30 healthy adult volunteers. Blood samples were collected for up to 72 hours post-dose in each period. Safety data included the results of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, an electrocardiogram, and adverse events. For both amlodipine and olmesartan, the 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratios of AUClast and time to peak plasma concentration fell within the bioequivalence acceptance criteria. The two fixed-dose combinations showed similar safety profiles. Amlodipine orotate/olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg was bioequivalent to amlodipine besylate/olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg.

Title #1218: Malignant hypertensive retinopathy as a presenting sign of an occult dead fetus.
PMID: 26082609
Authors: Joana J. AraÃºjo, JoÃ£o J. Tavares-Ferreira, Susana S. Penas, LuÃ­s L. Figueira, FlÃ¡vio PrÃ©zia FP. Paiva, Fernando F. FalcÃ£o-Reis
Abstract: We report one case of malignant hypertensive retinopathy as a presenting sign of fetal death in utero. Ophthalmic examination (including intravenous fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography) and obstetric and systemic evaluation were performed, providing a multidisciplinary approach. A 33-year-old overweight woman (body mass index 47 kg/m(2)) with no systemic or ocular known disease was admitted to our emergency department with a one-week history of bilateral vision loss and no systemic complaints. On examination, best corrected visual acuity was 1/10 in the right eye and 1/10 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopic fundus findings included bilateral optic disc edema, diffuse cotton wool spots, intraretinal exudates, retinal hemorrhages, and multiple serous retinal detachments involving both maculae. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 220/110 mmHg. Further systemic workup revealed a previously unknown 35-week pregnancy with a dead fetus. An emergency cesarean section was performed. Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disorder for both mother and fetus. This case highlights the need to rule out pre-eclampsia in all women of childbearing age presenting with ocular signs of malignant hypertension, even without external signs of pregnancy.


Title #1219: Delusional infestation: are you being bugged?
PMID: 26082608
Authors: Angeli A. Thakkar, Kenneth Gj KG. Ooi, Nagi N. Assaad, Minas M. Coroneo
Abstract: This case report documents a 58-year-old male who presented to the clinic with a 12-month history of a burrowing sensation in his eyelids that he attributed to a parasitic infestation. After being extensively investigated and reviewed by relevant specialties, no evidence of parasitic infestation was found. He was diagnosed with and treated for blepharitis. Psychiatric referral for presumed delusional infestation (DI) was recommended. Despite this, he remained insistent in his belief of infestation, and was inevitably lost to follow-up. DI, previously known as delusional parasitosis, is a rare delusional disorder where affected individuals have a fixed, false belief that they have a parasitic infestation. Diagnosis can be challenging. Practitioners need to evaluate between primary and secondary DI carefully, as management differs depending on the etiology. Despite this, patients diagnosed with primary DI tend to be resistant to psychiatric referral. This report aims to optimize management by giving the reader a guideline for appropriate investigations and advice on patient approach. It is important to recognize hallmark features of DI to minimize self-inflicted trauma and associated psychosocial consequences. Effective treatment for DI is available, and devastating consequences, including blindness, can be avoided.


Title #1220: Polycyclic Annular Lesion Masquerading as Lupus Erythematosus and Emerging as Tinea Faciei Incognito.
PMID: 26082592
Authors: Heesang H. Kye, Dai Hyun DH. Kim, Soo Hong SH. Seo, Hyo Hyun HH. Ahn, Young Chul YC. Kye, Jae Eun JE. Choi
Abstract: Tinea incognito is a dermatophytic infection induced by immunosuppressive agents that lacks the classic features of a typical fungal infection. Although the treatment of tinea incognito is simple and relatively easy, its clinical manifestation varies and can masquerade as various skin disorders, causing misdiagnosis and thus preventing prompt and appropriate treatment. Here, we report an interesting case of tinea incognito occurring after topical steroid administration in an immunosuppressed patient with dermatitis artefacta. A 40-year-old female patient who had been taking systemic glucocorticoid for 4 years for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy presented with itching multiple erythematous erosive lesions on the face and upper chest for 2 months. Initial biopsy produced nonspecific findings. The skin lesion was aggravated and became polycyclic and erythematous; after azathioprine was added, her chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy became aggravated. A second biopsy confirmed hyphae in the cornified layer. Complete remission was achieved after admonishing oral terbinafine and topical amorolfine.


Title #1221: Infundibulocystic Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
PMID: 26082591
Authors: So Min SM. Kim, Hyeree H. Kim, Hei Sung HS. Kim, Sang Hyun SH. Cho, Jeong Deuk JD. Lee
Abstract: Infundibulocystic squamous cell carcinoma was first reported in 2008 as a subset of squamous cell carcinoma arising from the infundibulum of the hair follicle and exhibiting infundibular differentiation. It has well-differentiated, less-differentiated, and infiltrative forms. It was thoroughly analyzed in a series of cases in 2011 by Misago et al. and has been redefined to include only the infiltrative form owing to its unique clinical and histological characteristics. Here, we report an interesting case of infundibulocystic squamous cell carcinoma in a 72-year-old man presenting with a mass on the left helix of the ear.


Title #1222: Concurrent Drug-Induced Linear Immunoglobulin A Dermatosis and Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy.
PMID: 26082590
Authors: Ji Seok JS. Kim, Misoo M. Choi, Chan Hee CH. Nam, Jee Young JY. Kim, Byung Cheol BC. Park, Myung Hwa MH. Kim, Seung Phil SP. Hong
Abstract: Diseases associated with immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody include linear IgA dermatosis, IgA nephropathy, Celiac disease, Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, etc. Although usually idiopathic, IgA antibody is occasionally induced by drugs (e.g., vancomycin, carbamazepine, ceftriaxone, and cyclosporine), malignancies, infections, and other causes. So far, only a few cases of IgA bullous dermatosis coexisting with IgA nephropathy have been reported. A 64-year-old female receiving intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole for liver abscess had purpuric macules and papules on her extremities. One week later, she had generalized edema and skin rash with bullae and was diagnosed with concurrent linear IgA dermatosis and IgA nephropathy. After steroid treatment, the skin lesion subsided within two weeks, and kidney function slowly returned to normal. As both diseases occurred after a common possible cause, we predict their pathogeneses are associated.


Title #1223: Cutaneous Metastatic Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma from a Mediastinal Sarcoma.
PMID: 26082589
Authors: Do Seon do.S. Jeong, Dong Hwa DH. Park, Chi Yeon CY. Kim
Abstract: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a malignant neoplasm that arises in both soft tissue and bones. In 2002, the World Health Organization declassified malignant fibrous histocytoma as a formal diagnostic entity and renamed it 'undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma not otherwise specified.' It most commonly occurs in the lower extremities and rarely metastasizes cutaneously. We report a case of cutaneous metastatic undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the buttocks occurring in a 73-year-old man diagnosed with mediastinal sarcoma 4 years previously. He first noticed the mass approximately 2 months previously. Histological findings with immunomarkers led to a final diagnosis of cutaneous metastatic sarcoma from mediastinal undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.


Title #1224: Cowden Syndrome with a Novel Germline PTEN Mutation and an Unusual Clinical Course.
PMID: 26082588
Authors: Jung Eun JE. Seol, In Ho IH. Park, Wonkyung W. Lee, Hyojin H. Kim, Jong Keun JK. Seo, Seung Hwan SH. Oh
Abstract: Here, we report a case of Cowden syndrome with an unusual clinical course of late-onset oral papillomatosis and a novel germline PTEN mutation. Cowden syndrome is the most common phosphatase and tensin homolog hamartomatous tumor syndrome. It is characterized by multiple hamartomas in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous lesions such as trichilemmomas, oral papillomatosis, facial papules, and acral keratoses. Patients with Cowden syndrome have a higher risk of malignancies, especially breast, colon, and thyroid cancers. A 53-year-old female presented with cobblestone-like papillomatous papules on the lower gums that developed 1 year earlier. She had no other mucocutaneous lesions besides oral papillomatosis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed multiple hamartomas in the stomach and colon. The patient had a history of breast cancer and multinodular goiter diagnosed 4 and 5 years ago, respectively. She was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome and a novel PTEN mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing.

Title #1243: Sn-Ag-Cu nanosolders: Melting behavior and phase diagram prediction in the Sn-rich corner of the ternary system.
PMID: 26082567
Authors: Ali A. Roshanghias, Jan J. Vrestal, Andriy A. Yakymovych, Klaus W KW. Richter, Herbert H. Ipser
Abstract: Melting temperatures of Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys in the Sn-rich corner are of interest for lead-free soldering. At the same time, nanoparticle solders with depressed melting temperatures close to the Sn-Pb eutectic temperature have received increasing attention. Recently, the phase stability of nanoparticles has been the subject of plenty of theoretical and empirical investigations. In the present study, SAC nanoparticles of various sizes have been synthesized via chemical reduction and the size dependent melting point depression of these particles has been specified experimentally. The liquidus projection in the Sn-rich corner of the ternary SAC system has also been calculated as a function of particle size, based on the CALPHAD-approach. The calculated melting temperatures were compared with those obtained experimentally and with values reported in the literature, which revealed good agreement. The model also predicts that with decreasing particle size, the eutectic composition shifts towards the Sn-rich corner.


Title #1244: Biohybrid Fibro-Porous Vascular Scaffolds: Effect of Crosslinking on Properties.
PMID: 26082566
Authors: Vinoy V. Thomas, Danna D. Nozik, Harsh H. Patel, Raj K RK. Singh, Yogesh K YK. Vohra
Abstract: Tubular grafts were fabricated from blends of polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(glycolide -co-caprolactone) (PGC) polymers and coated with an extracellular matrix containing collagens, laminin, and proteoglycans, but not growth factors (HuBiogelâ¢). Multifunctional scaffolds from polymer blends and membrane proteins provide the necessary biomechanics and biological functions for tissue regeneration. Two crosslinking agents, a natural crosslinker namely genipin (Gp) and a carbodiimide reagent namely 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), were used for further stabilizing the protein matrix and the effect of crosslinking was evaluated for structural, morphological, mechanical properties using SEM, DSC and DMA. SEM images and fiber diameter distribution showed fiber-size between 0.2 Âµm to 1 Âµm with the majority of fiber diameters being under 500 nm, indicating upper range of protein fiber-sizes (for example, collagen fibers in extracellular matrix are in 50 to 500 nm diameter range). HB coating did not affect the mechanical properties, but increased its hydrophilicity of the graft. Overall data showed that PCL/PGC blends with 3:1 mass ratio exhibited mechanical properties comparable to those of human native arteries (tensile strength of 1-2 MPa and Young's modulus of <10 MPa). Additionally, the effect of crosslinking on coating stability was investigated to assure the retention of proteins on scaffold for effective cell-matrix interactions.


Title #1245: Measuring electro-mechanical properties of thin films on polymer substrates.
PMID: 26082564
Authors: Megan J MJ. Cordill, O. O. Glushko, J. J. Kreith, V M VM. Marx, C. C. Kirchlechner
Abstract: In order to advance flexible electronic technologies it is important to study the electrical properties of thin metal films on polymer substrates under mechanical load. At the same time, the observation of film deformation and fracture as well as the stresses that are present in the films during straining are also crucial to investigate. To address both the electromechanical and deformation behavior of metal films supported by polymer substrates, in-situ 4 point probe resistance measurements were performed with in-situ atomic force microscopy imaging of the film surface during straining. The 4 point probe resistance measurements allow for the examination of the changes in resistance with strain, while the surface imaging permits the visualization of localized thinning and crack formation. Furthermore, in-situ synchrotron tensile tests provide information about the stresses in the film and show the yield stress where the deformation initiates and the relaxation of the film during imaging. A thin 200Â nm Cu film on 23Â Î¼m thick PET substrate will be used to illustrate the combined techniques. The combination of electrical measurements, surface imaging, and stress measurements allow for a better understanding of electromechanical behavior needed for the improvement and future success of flexible electronic devices.

Abstract: Exploiting the mechanisms responsible for the exceptional properties of aluminum based nitride coatings, we apply ab initio calculations to develop a recipe for designing functional thin film materials based on ternary diborides. The combination of binary diborides, preferring different structure types, results in supersaturated metastable ternary systems with potential for phase transformation induced effects. For the exemplary cases of M x W1Â -Â x B2 (with MÂ =Â Al, Ti, V) we show by detailed ab initio calculations that the respective ternary solid solutions are likely to be experimentally accessible by modern depositions techniques.


Title #1247: Hispanic Older Adult Health & Longevity in the United States: Current Patterns & Concerns for the Future.
PMID: 26082561
Authors: Robert A RA. Hummer, Mark D MD. Hayward
Abstract: The Hispanic population aged sixty-five and over - the most socioeconomically disadvantaged subset of America's elderly - is projected to quintuple between 2012 and 2050. While current longevity patterns for Hispanics relative to whites are favorable, old-age functioning and disability patterns for Hispanics are unfavorable and have serious implications for caregivers; families; and local, state, and federal governments. Troubling signs for the future Hispanic population (which are shared to varying degrees with other vulnerable groups) include the unresolved legal status of unauthorized immigrants, continued low levels of insurance coverage even after health care reform, some unfavorable trends in health behaviors, and continued disadvantages in educational attainment and income relative to whites. We urge policy-makers to deal with these potentially problematic health and well-being issues. Not doing so could have detrimental consequences for the future of the Hispanic population as well as other at-risk groups and, by extension, the U.S. elderly population as a whole.

Title #1249: B-1b Cells Secrete Atheroprotective IgM and Attenuate Atherosclerosis.
PMID: 26082558

Abstract: B cells contribute to atherosclerosis through subset specific mechanisms. Whereas some controversy exists about the role of B-2 cells, B-1a cells are atheroprotective due to secretion of atheroprotective IgM antibodies independent of antigen. B-1b cells, a unique subset of B-1 cells that respond specifically to T cell-independent antigens, have not been studied within the context of atherosclerosis.


Title #1250: MicroRNA-34a Plays a Key Role in Cardiac Repair and Regeneration Following Myocardial Infarction.
PMID: 26082557

Abstract: In response to injury, the rodent heart is capable of virtually full regeneration via cardiomyocyte proliferation very early in life. This regenerative capacity, however, is diminished as early as one week post-natal and remains lost in adulthood. The mechanisms that dictate post injury cardiomyocyte proliferation early in life remain unclear.

Abstract: In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, but without basal septal hypertrophy, we sought to identify mitral valve (MV) and papillary muscle (PM) abnormalities that predisposed to LVOT obstruction, using echo and cardiac magnetic resonance.


Title #1252: Estimating the impacts of conservation on ecosystem services and poverty by integrating modeling and evaluation.
PMID: 26082549

Abstract: Scholars have made great advances in modeling and mapping ecosystem services, and in assigning economic values to these services. This modeling and valuation scholarship is often disconnected from evidence about how actual conservation programs have affected ecosystem services, however. Without a stronger evidence base, decision makers find it difficult to use the insights from modeling and valuation to design effective policies and programs. To strengthen the evidence base, scholars have advanced our understanding of the causal pathways between conservation actions and environmental outcomes, but their studies measure impacts on imperfect proxies for ecosystem services (e.g., avoidance of deforestation). To be useful to decision makers, these impacts must be translated into changes in ecosystem services and values. To illustrate how this translation can be done, we estimated the impacts of protected areas in Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Thailand on carbon storage in forests. We found that protected areas in these conservation hotspots have stored at least an additional 1,000 Mt of CO2 in forests and have delivered ecosystem services worth at least $5 billion. This aggregate impact masks important spatial heterogeneity, however. Moreover, the spatial variability of impacts on carbon storage is the not the same as the spatial variability of impacts on avoided deforestation. These findings lead us to describe a research program that extends our framework to study other ecosystem services, to uncover the mechanisms by which ecosystem protection benefits humans, and to tie cost-benefit analyses to conservation planning so that we can obtain the greatest return on scarce conservation funds.


Title #1253: Public health impacts of ecosystem change in the Brazilian Amazon.
PMID: 26082548
Authors: Simone C SC. Bauch, Anna M AM. Birkenbach, Subhrendu K SK. Pattanayak, Erin O EO. Sills
Abstract: The claim that nature delivers health benefits rests on a thin empirical evidence base. Even less evidence exists on how specific conservation policies affect multiple health outcomes. We address these gaps in knowledge by combining municipal-level panel data on diseases, public health services, climatic factors, demographics, conservation policies, and other drivers of land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon. To fully exploit this dataset, we estimate random-effects and quantile regression models of disease incidence. We find that malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhea incidence are significantly and negatively correlated with the area under strict environmental protection. Results vary by disease for other types of protected areas (PAs), roads, and mining. The relationships between diseases and land-use change drivers also vary by quantile of the disease distribution. Conservation scenarios based on estimated regression results suggest that malaria, ARI, and diarrhea incidence would be reduced by expanding strict PAs, and malaria could be further reduced by restricting roads and mining. Although these relationships are complex, we conclude that interventions to preserve natural capital can deliver cobenefits by also increasing human (health) capital.


Title #1254: Spatial patterns of agricultural expansion determine impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage.

Abstract: The agricultural expansion and intensification required to meet growing food and agri-based product demand present important challenges to future levels and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Influential actors such as corporations, governments, and multilateral organizations have made commitments to meeting future agricultural demand sustainably and preserving critical ecosystems. Current approaches to predicting the impacts of agricultural expansion involve calculation of total land conversion and assessment of the impacts on biodiversity or ecosystem services on a per-area basis, generally assuming a linear relationship between impact and land area. However, the impacts of continuing land development are often not linear and can vary considerably with spatial configuration. We demonstrate what could be gained by spatially explicit analysis of agricultural expansion at a large scale compared with the simple measure of total area converted, with a focus on the impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Using simple modeling approaches for two regions of Brazil, we find that for the same amount of land conversion, the declines in biodiversity and carbon storage can vary two- to fourfold depending on the spatial pattern of conversion. Impacts increase most rapidly in the earliest stages of agricultural expansion and are more pronounced in scenarios where conversion occurs in forest interiors compared with expansion into forests from their edges. This study reveals the importance of spatially explicit information in the assessment of land-use change impacts and for future land management and conservation.


Title #1255: Impacts of conservation and human development policy across stakeholders and scales.

Abstract: Ideally, both ecosystem service and human development policies should improve human well-being through the conservation of ecosystems that provide valuable services. However, program costs and benefits to multiple stakeholders, and how they change through time, are rarely carefully analyzed. We examine one of China's new ecosystem service protection and human development policies: the Relocation and Settlement Program of Southern Shaanxi Province (RSP), which pays households who opt voluntarily to resettle from mountainous areas. The RSP aims to reduce disaster risk, restore important ecosystem services, and improve human well-being. We use household surveys and biophysical data in an integrated economic cost-benefit analysis for multiple stakeholders. We project that the RSP will result in positive net benefits to the municipal government, and to cross-region and global beneficiaries over the long run along with environment improvement, including improved water quality, soil erosion control, and carbon sequestration. However, there are significant short-run relocation costs for local residents so that poor households may have difficulty participating because they lack the resources to pay the initial costs of relocation. Greater subsidies and subsequent supports after relocation are necessary to reduce the payback period of resettled households in the long run. Compensation from downstream beneficiaries for improved water and from carbon trades could be channeled into reducing relocation costs for the poor and sharing the burden of RSP implementation. The effectiveness of the RSP could also be greatly strengthened by early investment in developing human capital and environment-friendly jobs and establishing long-term mechanisms for securing program goals. These challenges and potential solutions pervade ecosystem service efforts globally.


Title #1256: Embedding ecosystem services in coastal planning leads to better outcomes for people and nature.

Abstract: Recent calls for ocean planning envision informed management of social and ecological systems to sustain delivery of ecosystem services to people. However, until now, no coastal and marine planning process has applied an ecosystem-services framework to understand how human activities affect the flow of benefits, to create scenarios, and to design a management plan. We developed models that quantify services provided by corals, mangroves, and seagrasses. We used these models within an extensive engagement process to design a national spatial plan for Belize's coastal zone. Through iteration of modeling and stakeholder engagement, we developed a preferred plan, currently under formal consideration by the Belizean government. Our results suggest that the preferred plan will lead to greater returns from coastal protection and tourism than outcomes from scenarios oriented toward achieving either conservation or development goals. The plan will also reduce impacts to coastal habitat and increase revenues from lobster fishing relative to current management. By accounting for spatial variation in the impacts of coastal and ocean activities on benefits that ecosystems provide to people, our models allowed stakeholders and policymakers to refine zones of human use. The final version of the preferred plan improved expected coastal protection by >25% and more than doubled the revenue from fishing, compared with earlier versions based on stakeholder preferences alone. Including outcomes in terms of ecosystem-service supply and value allowed for explicit consideration of multiple benefits from oceans and coasts that typically are evaluated separately in management decisions.


Title #1257: Nature as capital: Advancing and incorporating ecosystem services in United States federal policies and programs.
PMID: 26082544
Authors: Mark M. Schaefer, Erica E. Goldman, Ann M AM. Bartuska, Ariana A. Sutton-Grier, Jane J. Lubchenco
Abstract: The concept of nature as capital is gaining visibility in policies and practices in both the public and private sectors. This change is due to an improved ability to assess and value ecosystem services, as well as to a growing recognition of the potential of an ecosystem services approach to make tradeoffs in decision making more transparent, inform efficient use of resources, enhance resilience and sustainability, and avoid unintended negative consequences of policy actions. Globally, governments, financial institutions, and corporations have begun to incorporate natural capital accounting in their policies and practices. In the United States, universities, nongovernmental organizations, and federal agencies are actively collaborating to develop and apply ecosystem services concepts to further national environmental and economic objectives. Numerous federal agencies have begun incorporating these concepts into land use planning, water resources management, and preparations for, and responses to, climate change. Going forward, well-defined policy direction will be necessary to institutionalize ecosystem services approaches in federal agencies, as well as to guide intersector and interdisciplinary collaborative research and development efforts. In addition, a new generation of decision support tools are needed to further the practical application of ecosystem services principles in policymaking and commercial activities. Improved performance metrics are needed, as are mechanisms to monitor the status of ecosystem services and assess the environmental and economic impacts of policies and programs. A greater national and international financial commitment to advancing ecosystem services and natural capital accounting would likely have broad, long-term economic and environmental benefits.


Title #1258: Improving global environmental management with standard corporate reporting.
PMID: 26082543
Authors: Peter M PM. Kareiva, Brynn W BW. McNally, Steve S. McCormick, Tom T. Miller, Mary M. Ruckelshaus
Abstract: Multinational corporations play a prominent role in shaping the environmental trajectory of the planet. The integration of environmental costs and benefits into corporate decision-making has enormous, but as yet unfulfilled, potential to promote sustainable development. To help steer business decisions toward better environmental outcomes, corporate reporting frameworks need to develop scientifically informed standards that consistently consider land use and land conversion, clean air (including greenhouse gas emissions), availability and quality of freshwater, degradation of coastal and marine habitats, and sustainable use of renewable resources such as soil, timber, and fisheries. Standardization by itself will not be enough-also required are advances in ecosystem modeling and in our understanding of critical ecological thresholds. With improving ecosystem science, the opportunity for realizing a major breakthrough in reporting corporate environmental impacts and dependencies has never been greater. Now is the time for ecologists to take advantage of an explosion of sustainability commitments from business leaders and expanding pressure for sustainable practices from shareholders, financial institutions, and consumers.


Title #1259: Adaptive governance, ecosystem management, and natural capital.
PMID: 26082542
Authors: Lisen L. Schultz, Carl C. Folke, Henrik H. Ãsterblom, Per P. Olsson
Abstract: To gain insights into the effects of adaptive governance on natural capital, we compare three well-studied initiatives; a landscape in Southern Sweden, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean. We assess changes in natural capital and ecosystem services related to these social-ecological governance approaches to ecosystem management and investigate their capacity to respond to change and new challenges. The adaptive governance initiatives are compared with other efforts aimed at conservation and sustainable use of natural capital: Natura 2000 in Europe, lobster fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, North America, and fisheries in Europe. In contrast to these efforts, we found that the adaptive governance cases developed capacity to perform ecosystem management, manage multiple ecosystem services, and monitor, communicate, and respond to ecosystem-wide changes at landscape and seascape levels with visible effects on natural capital. They enabled actors to collaborate across diverse interests, sectors, and institutional arrangements and detect opportunities and problems as they developed while nurturing adaptive capacity to deal with them. They all spanned local to international levels of decision making, thus representing multilevel governance systems for managing natural capital. As with any governance system, internal changes and external drivers of global impacts and demands will continue to challenge the long-term success of such initiatives.


Title #1260: Navigating complexity through knowledge coproduction: Mainstreaming ecosystem services into disaster risk reduction.
PMID: 26082541
Authors: Belinda B. Reyers, Jeanne L JL. Nel, Patrick J PJ. O'Farrell, Nadia N. Sitas, Deon C DC. Nel
Abstract: Achieving the policy and practice shifts needed to secure ecosystem services is hampered by the inherent complexities of ecosystem services and their management. Methods for the participatory production and exchange of knowledge offer an avenue to navigate this complexity together with the beneficiaries and managers of ecosystem services. We develop and apply a knowledge coproduction approach based on social-ecological systems research and assess its utility in generating shared knowledge and action for ecosystem services. The approach was piloted in South Africa across four case studies aimed at reducing the risk of disasters associated with floods, wildfires, storm waves, and droughts. Different configurations of stakeholders (knowledge brokers, assessment teams, implementers, and bridging agents) were involved in collaboratively designing each study, generating and exchanging knowledge, and planning for implementation. The approach proved useful in the development of shared knowledge on the sizable contribution of ecosystem services to disaster risk reduction. This knowledge was used by stakeholders to design and implement several actions to enhance ecosystem services, including new investments in ecosystem restoration, institutional changes in the private and public sector, and innovative partnerships of science, practice, and policy. By bringing together multiple disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders to jointly produce the knowledge needed to understand and manage a complex system, knowledge coproduction approaches offer an effective avenue for the improved integration of ecosystem services into decision making.


Title #1261: Setting the bar: Standards for ecosystem services.
PMID: 26082540
Authors: Stephen S. Polasky, Heather H. Tallis, Belinda B. Reyers
Abstract: Progress in ecosystem service science has been rapid, and there is now a healthy appetite among key public and private sector decision makers for this science. However, changing policy and management is a long-term project, one that raises a number of specific practical challenges. One impediment to broad adoption of ecosystem service information is the lack of standards that define terminology, acceptable data and methods, and reporting requirements. Ecosystem service standards should be tailored to specific use contexts, such as national income and wealth accounts, corporate sustainability reporting, land-use planning, and environmental impact assessments. Many standard-setting organizations already exist, and the research community will make the most headway toward rapid uptake of ecosystem service science by working directly with these organizations. Progress has been made in aligning with existing organizations in areas such as product certification and sustainability reporting, but a major challenge remains in mainstreaming ecosystem service information into core public and private use contexts, such as agricultural and energy subsidy design, national income accounts, and corporate accounts.


Title #1262: Natural capital and ecosystem services informing decisions: From promise to practice.

Abstract: The central challenge of the 21st century is to develop economic, social, and governance systems capable of ending poverty and achieving sustainable levels of population and consumption while securing the life-support systems underpinning current and future human well-being. Essential to meeting this challenge is the incorporation of natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides into decision-making. We explore progress and crucial gaps at this frontier, reflecting upon the 10 y since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We focus on three key dimensions of progress and ongoing challenges: raising awareness of the interdependence of ecosystems and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplinary science of ecosystem services, and implementing this science in decisions to restore natural capital and use it sustainably. Awareness of human dependence on nature is at an all-time high, the science of ecosystem services is rapidly advancing, and talk of natural capital is now common from governments to corporate boardrooms. However, successful implementation is still in early stages. We explore why ecosystem service information has yet to fundamentally change decision-making and suggest a path forward that emphasizes: (i) developing solid evidence linking decisions to impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services, and then to human well-being; (ii) working closely with leaders in government, business, and civil society to develop the knowledge, tools, and practices necessary to integrate natural capital and ecosystem services into everyday decision-making; and (iii) reforming institutions to change policy and practices to better align private short-term goals with societal long-term goals.


Title #1263: Exploring genotype-phenotype relationships in Bardet-Biedl syndrome families.
PMID: 26082521

Abstract: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic autosomal recessive ciliopathy that displays retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, urogenital anomalies and renal abnormalities as primary clinical features. To date, 19 causative genes (BBS1-19) have been involved, whose mutations would explain over 80% of patients. The overlapping phenotypes among ciliopathies, in addition to the high intrafamilial and interfamilial variability in clinical presentation, further complicate the diagnosis of this syndrome. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to elucidate some genotype-phenotype trends that could be helpful to focus the molecular diagnosis of patients with BBS.


Title #1264: The GYF domain protein CD2BP2 is critical for embryogenesis and podocyte function.

Girbig, Norbert N. HÃ¼bner, Eberhard E. Krause, Holger H. Scholz, Tobias B TB. Huber, Klaus-Peter KP. Knobeloch, Christian C. Freund
Abstract: Scaffolding proteins play pivotal roles in the assembly of macromolecular machines such as the spliceosome. The adaptor protein CD2BP2, originally identified as a binding partner of the adhesion molecule CD2, is a pre-spliceosomal assembly factor that utilizes its glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain to co-localize with spliceosomal proteins. So far, its function in vertebrates is unknown. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that CD2BP2 is crucial for embryogenesis, leading to growth retardation, defects in vascularization, and premature death at embryonic day 10.5 when absent. Ablation of the protein in bone marrow-derived macrophages indicates that CD2BP2 is involved in the alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts from diverse origins. At the molecular level, we identified the phosphatase PP1 to be recruited to the spliceosome via the N-terminus of CD2BP2. Given the strong expression of CD2BP2 in podocytes of the kidney, we use selective depletion of CD2BP2, in combination with next-generation sequencing, to monitor changes in exon usage of genes critical for podocyte functions, including VEGF and actin regulation. CD2BP2-depleted podocytes display foot process effacement, and cause proteinuria and ultimately lethal kidney failure in mice. Collectively, our study defines CD2BP2 as a non-redundant splicing factor essential for embryonic development and podocyte integrity.


Title #1265: Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of Î³-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity.

Abstract: BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory ("trained immunity") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed Î³BCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with Î³BCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of Î³BCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. Î³BCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. Î³BCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that Î³BCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, Î³BCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited.

Title #1270: Grading lymph node metastasis: a feasible approach for prognostication of patients with stage III colorectal cancer.
PMID: 26082514

Abstract: This study aimed to assess the clinicopathological significance of tumour differentiation of metastatic lymph node tissue in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage III colorectal cancer. In a cohort of 145 patients, lymph node grades were G1 in 77 (53.1%), G2 in 41 (28.3%) and G3 in 27 (18.6%) cases, respectively. Despite differences in 77 (53.1%) cases, primary tumour and lymph node grade correlated significantly (Somer's D=0.639; p<0.001). Lymph node grade was significantly associated with N classification (p=0.009), tumour size (p=0.024) and lymphovascular invasion (p=0.004). Patients with lymph node grade G1 had better progression-free survival (p=0.031) and cancer-specific survival (p=0.008). Multivariable analysis identified lymph node grade as independent predictor of cancer-specific survival in this cohort. In conclusion, lymph node grade emerged as a promising novel prognostic variable for patients with AJCC/UICC stage III disease. Additional studies are warranted to validate this new finding.


Title #1271: Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia.
PMID: 26082513
Authors: Guldeep G. Uppal, Jerald J. Gong
Abstract: Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (CNL) is a rare type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterised by sustained leucocytosis (â¥25Ã10(9)/L) with neoplastic proliferation of neutrophilic granulocytes in blood and bone marrow. In contrast to chronic myeloid leukaemia, the disease primarily involves neutrophilic lineage with persistent proliferation of mature forms of neutrophils. No consistent cytogenetic changes have been reported. Known recurrent genetic changes in other MPNs such as JAK2, MPL, CALR, BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1 are mostly absent. Recently, mutations in colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) have been reported in high frequency in CNL. This discovery has provided more insight into its pathogenesis and opened up possible treatment options. In this article, we review the clinical findings, morphology, pathobiology and differential diagnosis of CNL and treatment implications of CSF3R mutations.

Title #1273: Vancomycin combined with clindamycin for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections.
PMID: 26082508
Authors: Kurt A KA. Wargo, Erin K EK. McCreary, Thomas M TM. English
Abstract: âAcute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) are common causes of hospital admissions. These infections are often caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), therefore vancomycin remains a commonly used therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients treated with vancomycin monotherapy versus combination therapy with clindamycin for ABSSSI.

Abstract: âThe effectiveness of liver transplant (LT) in HIV and HIV/HCV co-infected recipients in the US is unknown. We investigated (i) the effect of HIV on US patient and allograft LT outcomes, compared to HCV+ and HIV/HCV uninfected recipients and (ii) whether LT at centers that participated in the NIH Solid Organ Transplantation in HIV Trial, reflecting experience and a standardized approach to patient selection, impacted outcomes.

Abstract: âThe goal of targeted antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is to minimize disease progression among patients with HIV while also minimizing the therapeutic burden on these patients. Here, we examine whether the effect of delaying ART initiation from 500 cells/mm(3) to 350 or 200 cells/mm(3) is modified by age at entry into care.

Title #1280: Genome wide interactions of wild-type and activator bypass forms of Ï54.
PMID: 26082500
Authors: Jorrit J. Schaefer, Christoph C. Engl, Nan N. Zhang, Edward E. Lawton, Martin M. Buck
Abstract: Enhancer-dependent transcription involving the promoter specificity factor Ï(54) is widely distributed amongst bacteria and commonly associated with cell envelope function. For transcription initiation, Ï(54)-RNA polymerase yields open promoter complexes through its remodelling by cognate AAA+ ATPase activators. Since activators can be bypassed in vitro, bypass transcription in vivo could be a source of emergent gene expression along evolutionary pathways yielding new control networks and transcription patterns. At a single test promoter in vivo bypass transcription was not observed. We now use genome-wide transcription profiling, genome-wide mutagenesis and gene over-expression strategies in Escherichia coli, to (i) scope the range of bypass transcription in vivo and (ii) identify genes which might alter bypass transcription in vivo. We find little evidence for pervasive bypass transcription in vivo with only a small subset of Ï(54) promoters functioning without activators. Results also suggest no one gene limits bypass transcription in vivo, arguing bypass transcription is strongly kept in check. Promoter sequences subject to repression by Ï(54) were evident, indicating loss of rpoN (encoding Ï(54)) rather than creating rpoN bypass alleles would be one evolutionary route for new gene expression patterns. Finally, cold-shock promoters showed unusual Ï(54)-dependence in vivo not readily correlated with conventional Ï(54) binding-sites.


Title #1281: Decoupling of divergent gene regulation by sequence-specific DNA binding factors.
PMID: 26082499
Authors: Chao C. Yan, Daoyong D. Zhang, Juan Antonio JA. Raygoza Garay, Michael M MM. Mwangi, Lu L. Bai
Abstract: Divergent gene pairs (DGPs) are abundant in eukaryotic genomes. Since two genes in a DGP potentially share the same regulatory sequence, one might expect that they should be co-regulated. However, an inspection of yeast DGPs containing cell-cycle or stress response genes revealed that most DGPs are differentially-regulated. The mechanism underlying DGP differential regulation is not understood. Here, we showed that co- versus differential regulation cannot be explained by genetic features including promoter length, binding site orientation, TATA elements, nucleosome distribution, or presence of non-coding RNAs. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we carried out an in-depth study of a differentially regulated DGP, PFK26-MOB1. We found that their differential regulation is mainly achieved through two DNA-binding factors, Tbf1 and Mcm1. Similar to 'enhancer-blocking insulators' in higher eukaryotes, these factors shield the proximal promoter from the action of more distant transcription regulators. We confirmed the blockage function of Tbf1 using synthetic promoters. We further presented evidence that the blockage mechanism is widely used among genome-wide DGPs. Besides elucidating the DGP regulatory mechanism, our work revealed a novel class of insulators in yeast.


Title #1282: Cross talk between the response regulators PhoB and TctD allows for the integration of diverse environmental signals in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Abstract: Two-component systems (TCS) serve as stimulus-response coupling mechanisms to allow organisms to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes for more than 100 TCS components. To avoid unwanted cross-talk, signaling cascades are very specific, with one sensor talking to its cognate response regulator (RR). However, cross-regulation may provide means to integrate different environmental stimuli into a harmonized output response. By applying a split luciferase complementation assay, we identified a functional interaction of two RRs of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, namely PhoB and TctD in P. aeruginosa. Transcriptional profiling, ChIP-seq analysis and a global motif scan uncovered the regulons of the two RRs as well as a quadripartite binding motif in six promoter regions. Phosphate limitation resulted in PhoB-dependent expression of the downstream genes, whereas the presence of TctD counteracted this activation. Thus, the integration of two important environmental signals e.g. phosphate availability and the carbon source are achieved by a titration of the relative amounts of two phosphorylated RRs that inversely regulate a common subset of genes. In conclusion, our results on the PhoB and TctD mediated two-component signal transduction pathways exemplify how P. aeruginosa may exploit cross-regulation to adapt bacterial behavior to complex environments.


Title #1283: RNASequel: accurate and repeat tolerant realignment of RNA-seq reads.
PMID: 26082497
Authors: Gavin W GW. Wilson, Lincoln D LD. Stein
Abstract: RNA-seq is a key technology for understanding the biology of the cell because of its ability to profile transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation at single nucleotide resolutions. Compared to DNA sequencing alignment algorithms, RNA-seq alignment algorithms have a diminished ability to accurately detect and map base pair substitutions, gaps, discordant pairs and repetitive regions. These shortcomings adversely affect experiments that require a high degree of accuracy, notably the ability to detect RNA editing. We have developed RNASequel, a software package that runs as a post-processing step in conjunction with an RNA-seq aligner and systematically corrects common alignment artifacts. Its key innovations are a two-pass splice junction alignment system that includes de novo splice junctions and the use of an empirically determined estimate of the fragment size distribution when resolving read pairs. We demonstrate that RNASequel produces improved alignments when used in conjunction with STAR or Tophat2 using two simulated datasets. We then show that RNASequel improves the identification of adenosine to inosine RNA editing sites on biological datasets. This software will be useful in applications requiring the accurate identification of variants in RNA sequencing data, the discovery of RNA editing sites and the analysis of alternative splicing.


Title #1284: Development of an intein-mediated split-Cas9 system for gene therapy.

Abstract: Using CRISPR/Cas9, it is possible to target virtually any gene in any organism. A major limitation to its application in gene therapy is the size of Cas9 (>4 kb), impeding its efficient delivery via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Therefore, we developed a split-Cas9 system, bypassing the packaging limit using split-inteins. Each Cas9 half was fused to the corresponding split-intein moiety and, only upon co-expression, the intein-mediated trans-splicing occurs and the full Cas9 protein is reconstituted. We demonstrated that the nuclease activity of our split-intein system is comparable to wild-type Cas9, shown by a genome-integrated surrogate reporter and by targeting three different endogenous genes. An analogously designed split-Cas9D10A nickase version showed similar activity as Cas9D10A. Moreover, we showed that the double nick strategy increased the homologous directed recombination (HDR). In addition, we explored the possibility of delivering the repair template accommodated on the same dual-plasmid system, by transient transfection, showing an efficient HDR. Most importantly, we revealed for the first time that intein-mediated split-Cas9 can be packaged, delivered and its nuclease activity reconstituted efficiently, in cells via rAAV.


Title #1285: Targeted DNA damage at individual telomeres disrupts their integrity and triggers cell death.

Abstract: Cellular DNA is organized into chromosomes and capped by a unique nucleoprotein structure, the telomere. Both oxidative stress and telomere shortening/dysfunction cause aging-related degenerative pathologies and increase cancer risk. However, a direct connection between oxidative damage to telomeric DNA, comprising <1% of the genome, and telomere dysfunction has not been established. By fusing the KillerRed chromophore with the telomere repeat binding factor 1, TRF1, we developed a novel approach to generate localized damage to telomere DNA and to monitor the real time damage response at the single telomere level. We found that DNA damage at long telomeres in U2OS cells is not repaired efficiently compared to DNA damage in non-telomeric regions of the same length in heterochromatin. Telomeric DNA damage shortens the average length of telomeres and leads to cell senescence in HeLa cells and cell death in HeLa, U2OS and IMR90 cells, when DNA damage at non-telomeric regions is undetectable. Telomere-specific damage induces chromosomal aberrations, including chromatid telomere loss and telomere associations, distinct from the damage induced by ionizing irradiation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that oxidative damage induces telomere dysfunction and underline the importance of maintaining telomere integrity upon oxidative damage.


Title #1286: What is the source of anticontractile factor released by the pedicle of human internal thoracic artery?â .
PMID: 26082494
Authors: Karolina K. Kociszewska, Marcin M. Malinowski, Piotr P. Czekaj, Marek A MA. Deja
Abstract: Perivascular tissue (PVT) surrounding human internal thoracic artery (ITA) releases an unidentified anticontractile factor. The exact source of perivascular tissue-derived relaxing factor (PVRF) is unknown, although the adventitia and adipose tissue have both been suggested as primary candidates, hence the name adventitia or adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF). To look for the source of ADRF, we examined the dilatory response of human ITA to PVT aliquots in their histological composition.


Title #1287: Role of Novel Serine 316 Phosphorylation of the p65 Subunit of NF-ÎºB in Differential Gene Regulation.
PMID: 26082493
Authors: Benlian B. Wang, Han H. Wei, Lakshmi L. Prabhu, Wei W. Zhao, Matthew M. Martin, Antja-Voy AV. Hartley, Tao T. Lu
Abstract: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) is a central coordinator in immune and inflammatory responses. Constitutive NF-ÎºB is often found in some types of cancers, contributing to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Therefore, knowing how NF-ÎºB is regulated is important for its therapeutic control. Post-translational modification of the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB is a well-known approach for its regulation. Here, we reported that, in response to interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²), the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB is phosphorylated on the novel serine 316 (S316). Overexpression of S316A (serine 316-alanine) mutant exhibited significantly reduced ability to activate NF-ÎºB and decreased cell growth as compared to wtp65 (wild type p65). Moreover, conditioned media from cells expressing the S316A-p65 mutant had a considerably lower ability to induce NF-ÎºB than that of wtp65. Our data suggested that phosphorylation of p65 on S316 controls the activity and function of NF-ÎºB. Importantly, we found that phosphorylation at novel S316 site, and other two known phosphorylation sites-S529 and S536-either individually or cooperatively, regulated distinct groups of NF-ÎºB-dependent genes, suggesting the unique role of each individual phosphorylation site on NF-ÎºB-dependent gene regulation. Our novel findings provide an important piece of evidence regarding differential regulation of NF-ÎºB-dependent genes through phosphorylation of different p65 serine residues, thus shedding light on novel mechanisms for the pathway-specific control of NF-ÎºB. This knowledge is key to develop strategies for prevention and treatment of constitutive NF-ÎºB-driven inflammatory diseases and cancers.


Title #1288: Characterizations of Two Bacterial Persulfide Dioxygenases of the Metallo-Î²-lactamase Superfamily.

Abstract: Persulfide dioxygenases (PDOs), also known as sulfur dioxygenases (SDOs), oxidize glutathione persulfide (GSSH) to sulfite and GSH. PDOs belong to the metallo-Î²-lactamase superfamily and play critical roles in animals, plants and microorganisms, including sulfide detoxification. The structures of two PDOs from human and Arabidopsis thaliana have been reported; however, little is known about the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism. The crystal structures of two bacterial PDOs from Pseudomonas putida and Myxococcus xanthus were determined at 1.5 and 2.5 Ã resolution, respectively. The structures of both PDOs were homo-dimers, and their metal centers and Î²-lactamase folds were superimposable with those of related enzymes, especially the glyoxalases II. The PDOs share similar Fe(II) coordination and a secondary coordination sphere-based hydrogen bond network that is absent in glyoxalases II, in which the corresponding residues are involved instead in coordinating a second metal ion. The crystal structure of the complex between the Pseudomonas PDO and GSH also reveals the similarity of substrate binding between it and glyoxalases II. Further analysis implicates an identical mode of substrate binding by known PDOs. Thus, the data not only reveal the differences in metal binding and coordination between the dioxygenases and the hydrolytic enzymes in the metallo-Î²-lactamase superfamily, but also provide detailed information on substrate binding by PDOs.


Title #1289: Chitoporin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi: probing the essential roles of Trp136 at the surface of the constriction zone.
PMID: 26082491
Authors: Watcharin W. Chumjan, Mathias M. Winterhalter, Albert A. Schulte, Roland R. Benz, Wipa W. Suginta
Abstract: VhChiP is a sugar-specific porin present in the outer membrane of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi. VhChiP is responsible for the uptake of chitin oligosaccharides, with particular selectivity for chitohexaose. In this study, we employed electrophysiological and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that Trp136, located at the mouth of the VhChiP pore, plays an essential role in controlling the channel's ion conductivity, chitin affinity and permeability. Kinetic analysis of sugar translocation obtained from single channel recordings indicated that the Trp136 mutations W136A, W136D, W136R and W136F considerably reduce the binding affinity of the protein channel for its best substrate, chitohexaose. Liposome swelling assays confirmed that the Trp136 mutations decreased the rate of bulk chitohexaose permeation through the VhChiP channel. Notably, all the mutants show increases in the off-rate for chitohexaose, of up to 20-fold compared to that of the native channel. Furthermore the cation/anion permeability ratio Pc/Pa is decreased in the W136R mutant and increased in the W136D mutant. This demonstrates that the negatively-charged surface at the interior of the protein lumen preferentially attracts cationic species, leading to the cation-selectivity of this trimeric channel.


Title #1290: Deficiency of beta common receptor moderately attenuates the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasm in Nras G12D/+ mice.

Abstract: Activating Ras signaling is a major driver in juvenile and the myeloproliferative variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML/MP-CMML). Numerous studies suggest that GM-CSF signaling plays a central role in establishing and maintaining JMML/MP-CMML phenotypes in human and mouse. However, it remains elusive how GM-CSF signaling impacts on JMML/MP-CMML initiation and progression. Here, we investigate this issue in a well-characterized MP-CMML model induced by endogenous Nras G12D/+ mutation. In this model, Nras G12D/+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are required to initiate and maintain CMML phenotypes and serve as CMML initiating cells. We show that the common beta chain of the GM-CSF receptor (beta c) is dispensable for Nras G12D/+ HSC function; loss of beta c does not affect the expansion, increased self-renewal, or myeloid differentiation bias in Nras G12D/+ HSCs. Therefore, beta c-/- does not abrogate CMML in Nras G12D/+ mice. However, beta c deficiency indeed significantly reduces Nras G12D/+-induced splenomegaly and spontaneous colony formation and prolongs the survival of CMML-bearing mice, suggesting that GM-CSF signaling plays an important role in promoting CMML progression. Together, our results suggest that inhibiting GM-CSF signaling in JMML/MP-CMML patients might alleviate disease symptoms but would not eradicate the disease.


Title #1291: Pellino-1 positively regulates Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 signaling and is suppressed upon induction of endotoxin tolerance.
PMID: 26082489
Authors: Michael M. Murphy, Yanbao Y. Xiong, Goutham G. Pattabiraman, Fu F. Qiu, Andrei E AE. Medvedev
Abstract: Endotoxin tolerance reprograms Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated macrophage responses by attenuating induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines while retaining expression anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators. We previously demonstrated deficient TLR4-induced activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 4, IRAK1, and TANK-binding kinase (TBK) 1 as critical hallmarks of endotoxin tolerance, but mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino-1 in endotoxin tolerance and TLR signaling. LPS stimulation increased Pellino-1 mRNA and protein expression in macrophages from mice injected with saline and in medium-pretreated human monocytes, THP-1 and MonoMac-6 cells, while endotoxin tolerization abrogated LPS inducibilty of Pellino-1. Overexpression of Pellino-1 in 293/TLR2 and 293/TLR4/MD2 cells enhanced TLR2- and TLR4-induced nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and expression of IL-8 mRNA, while Pellino-1 knockdown reduced these responses. Pellino-1 ablation in THP-1 cells impaired induction of myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) - and Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-Î² (TRIF)-dependent cytokine genes in response to TLR4 and TLR2 agonists and heat-killed Esherichia coli and Streptococcus aureus, while only weakly affecting phagocytosis of heat-killed bacteria. Co-expressed Pellino-1 potentiated NF-ÎºB activation driven by transfected MyD88, TRIF, IRAK1, TBK1, TGF-Î²-activated kinase (TAK) 1 and TNFR-associated factor 6, while not affecting p65-induced responses. Mechanistically, Pellino-1 increased LPS-driven K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1, TBK1, TAK1, and phosphorylation of TBK1 and IFN regulatory factor 3. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which endotoxin tolerance re-programs TLR4 signaling via suppression of Pellino-1, a positive regulator of MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling that promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1, TBK1, and TAK1.


Title #1292: Electrostatic Architecture of the Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) Core Fusion Protein Illustrates a Carboxyl-Carboxylate pH-Sensor.
PMID: 26082488
Authors: Jonathan D JD. Cook, Hazel H. Soto-Montoya, Markus K MK. Korpela, Jeffrey E JE. Lee
Abstract: Segment 5, open reading frame (ORF) 1 of the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) genome encodes for the ISAV F protein, which is responsible for viral-host endosomal membrane fusion during a productive ISAV infection. The entry machinery of ISAV is comprised of a complex of the ISAV F and ISAV HE proteins in an unknown stoichiometry prior to receptor engagement by ISAV HE. Following binding of the receptor to ISAV HE, dissociation of the ISAV F protein from HE and subsequent endocytosis, the ISAV F protein resolves into a fusion competent oligomeric state. Here, we present a 2.1 Ã crystal structure of the fusion core of the ISAV F protein solved at low pH. This structure has allowed us to unambiguously demonstrate that the ISAV entry machinery exhibits typical Class I viral fusion protein architecture. Furthermore, we have determined stabilizing factors that accommodate the pH-dependent mode of ISAV transmission and our structure has allowed the identification of a central coil that is conserved across numerous and varied post-fusion viral glycoprotein structures. We then discuss a mechanistic model of ISAV fusion that parallels the paramyxoviral Class I fusion strategy wherein attachment and fusion are relegated to separate proteins in a similar fashion to ISAV fusion.


Title #1293: Down-regulation of stathmin is required for the phenotypic changes and classical activation of macrophages.
PMID: 26082487
Authors: Kewei K. Xu, Rene E RE. Harrison
Abstract: Macrophages are important cells of innate immunity with specialized capacity for recognition and elimination of pathogens and presentation of antigens to lymphocytes for adaptive immunity. Macrophages become activated upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogenic stimuli. Classical activation of macrophages with interferonÎ³ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers a wide range of signaling events and morphological changes to induce the immune response. Our previous microtubule (MT) proteomic work revealed that stathmin association with MTs is considerably reduced in activated macrophages, which contain significantly more stabilized MTs. Here we show that there is a global decrease in stathmin levels, a MT catastrophe protein, in activated macrophages using both immunoblotting and immunofluorescent microscopy. This is an LPS-specific response that induces proteasome-mediated degradation of stathmin. We explored the functions of stathmin down-regulation in activated macrophages by generating a stable cell line overexpressing stathmin-GFP. We show that stathmin-GFP overexpression impacts MT stability, impairs cell spreading and reduces activation-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, overexpressing stathmin reduces complement receptor 3 (CR3)-mediated phagocytosis and cellular activation, implicating a pivotal inhibitory role for stathmin in classically activated macrophages.


Title #1294: Deoxyhypusine modification of eIF5A is essential for Trypanosoma brucei growth and for expression of polyprolyl-containing proteins.
PMID: 26082486

Abstract: The eukaryotic protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)2. Polyamine biosynthesis is essential in T. brucei and the polyamine spermidine is required for synthesis of a novel cofactor called trypanothione and for deoxyhypusine modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). eIF5A promotes translation of proteins containing polyprolyl tracks in mammals and yeast. To evaluate the function of eIF5A in T. brucei we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown eIF5A levels and found that it is essential for T. brucei growth. The RNAi-induced growth defect was complemented by expression of wild-type human eIF5A but not by a Lys-50 mutant that blocks modification by deoxyhypusine. Bioinformatic analysis showed that 15% of the T. brucei proteome contains 3 or more consecutive prolines and that actin-related proteins and cysteine proteases were highly enriched in the group. Steady-state protein levels of representative proteins containing 9 consecutive prolines that are involved in actin assembly (formin and CAP/Srv2p) were significantly reduced by knockdown of eIF5A. Several T. brucei polyprolyl proteins are involved in flagellar assembly. Knockdown of TbeIF5A led to abnormal cell morphologies and detached flagella suggesting eIF5A is important for translation of proteins needed for these processes. Potential specialized functions for eIF5A in T. brucei in translation of variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) were also uncovered. Inhibitors of deoxyhypusination would be expected to cause a pleomorphic effect on multiple cell processes, suggesting deoxyhypusine/hypusine biosynthesis could be a promising drug target in not just T. brucei but in other eukaryotic pathogens.


Title #1295: Steroid Receptor Coactivator 1 Promotes Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression by Enhancing Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling.
PMID: 26082485

Abstract: Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) is a transcriptional coactivator not only for steroid receptors such as androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER), but also for other transcription factors. SRC-1 has been shown to play an important role in the progression of breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, its role in liver cancer progression remains unknown. In this study, we report that SRC-1 was overexpressed in 25 (62.5%) of 40 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Downregulation of SRC-1 decreased HCC cell proliferation and impaired tumor maintenance in HCC xenografts. Knockdown of SRC-1 reduced protein levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the oncogene c-Myc. Knockout of SRC-1 in mice reduced DEN/CCl4-induced tumor formation in the liver and the expression of c-Myc and PCNA in liver tumors. SRC-1 promoted c-Myc expression, at least in part, by directly interacting with Î²-Catenin to enhance Wnt/Î²-Catenin signaling. Consistent with these results, the expression of SRC-1 was positively correlated with PCNA expression in human HCC specimens, and the expression levels of c-Myc in SRC-1-positive HCC specimens were higher than in SRC-1-negative HCC specimens. In addition, SRC-1 and SRC-3 were co-overexpressed in 47.5% of HCC specimens, and they cooperated to promote HCC cell proliferation. Simultaneous downregulation of SRC-1 and SRC-3 dramatically inhibited HCC cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that SRC-1 promotes HCC progression by enhancing Wnt/Î²-Catenin signaling and suggest that SRC-1 is a potential therapeutic molecular target for HCC.


Title #1296: Does Environmental Heterogeneity Promote Cognitive Abilities?
PMID: 26082484
Authors: Paulina L PL. GonzÃ¡lez-GÃ³mez, Pablo P. Razeto-Barry, Marcelo M. Araya-Salas, Cristian F CF. Estades
Abstract: In the context of global change the possible loss of biodiversity has been identified as a major concern. Biodiversity could be seriously threatened as a direct consequence of changes in availability of food, changing thermal conditions, and loss and fragmentation of habitat. Considering the magnitude of global change, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in coping with a changing environment is urgent. We explore the hypothesis that species and individuals experiencing highly variable environments are more likely to develop a wider range of responses to handle the different and unpredictable conditions imposed by global change. In the case of vertebrates, the responses to the challenges imposed by unpredictable perturbations ultimately are linked to cognitive abilities allowing the solving of problems, and the maximization of energy intake. Our models were hummingbirds, which offer a particularly compelling group in which to examine the functional and mechanistic links between behavioral and energetic strategies in individuals experiencing different degrees of social and environmental heterogeneity.

Abstract: The adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2Ï2) is pivotal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane constituents such as the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Mutations of the AP2Ï2 Arg15 residue result in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 3 (FHH3), a disorder of extracellular calcium (Ca(2+) o) homeostasis. To elucidate the role of AP2Ï2 in Ca(2+) o regulation, we investigated 65 FHH probands, without other FHH-associated mutations, for AP2Ï2 mutations, characterized their functional consequences, and investigated the genetic mechanisms leading to FHH3. AP2Ï2 mutations were identified in 17 probands, comprising five Arg15Cys, four Arg15His and eight Arg15Leu mutations. A genotype-phenotype correlation was observed with the Arg15Leu mutation leading to marked hypercalcaemia. FHH3 probands harboured additional phenotypes such as cognitive dysfunction. All three FHH3-causing AP2Ï2 mutations impaired CaSR signal transduction in a dominant-negative manner. Mutational bias was observed at the AP2Ï2 Arg15 residue as other predicted missense substitutions (Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser), which also caused CaSR loss-of-function, were not detected in FHH probands, and these mutations were found to reduce the numbers of CaSR-expressing cells. FHH3 probands had significantly greater serum calcium (sCa) and magnesium (sMg) concentrations with reduced urinary calcium to creatinine clearance ratios (CCCR) in comparison to FHH1 probands with CaSR mutations, and a calculated index of sCa*sMg/100*CCCR, that wasâ¥5.0 had a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 86%, respectively, for FHH3. Thus, our studies demonstrate AP2Ï2 mutations to result in a more severe FHH phenotype with genotype-phenotype correlations, and a dominant-negative mechanism of action with mutational bias at the Arg15 residue.


Title #1311: Decreased Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 levels and activity contribute to Huntington's Disease.
PMID: 26082469

Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by brain atrophy particularly in striatum leading to personality changes, chorea and dementia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase in the crossroad of many signaling pathways that is highly pleiotropic as it phosphorylates more than hundred substrates including structural, metabolic and signaling proteins. Increased GSK-3 activity is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and GSK-3 inhibitors have been postulated as therapeutic agents for neurodegeneration. Regarding HD, GSK-3 inhibitors have shown beneficial effects in cell and invertebrate animal models but no evident efficacy in mouse models. Intriguingly, those studies were performed without interrogating GSK-3 level and activity in HD brain. Here we aim to explore the level and also the enzymatic activity of GSK-3 in the striatum and other less affected brain regions of HD patients and of the R6/1 mouse model to then elucidate the possible contribution of its alteration to HD pathogenesis by genetic manipulation in mice. We report a dramatic decrease in GSK-3 levels and activity in striatum and cortex of HD patients with similar results in the mouse model. Correction of the GSK-3 deficit in HD mice, by combining with transgenic mice with conditional GSK-3 expression, resulted in amelioration of their brain atrophy and behavioral motor and learning deficits. Thus, our results demonstrate that decreased brain GSK-3 contributes to HD neurological phenotype and open new therapeutic opportunities based on increasing GSK-3 activity or attenuating the harmful consequences of its decrease.


Title #1312: Therapeutic impact of systemic AAV-mediated RNA interference in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy.
PMID: 26082468

Abstract: RNA interference (RNAi) offers a promising therapeutic approach for dominant genetic disorders that involve gain-of-function mechanisms. One candidate disease for RNAi therapy application is myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which results from toxicity of a mutant mRNA. DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene. The expression of DMPK mRNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)) leads to defects in RNA biogenesis and turnover. We designed miRNA-based RNAi hairpins to target the CUG(exp) mRNA in the human Î±-skeletal muscle actin long-repeat (HSA(LR)) mouse model of DM1. RNAi expression cassettes were delivered to HSA(LR) mice using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors injected intravenously as a route to systemic gene therapy. Vector delivery significantly reduced disease pathology in muscles of the HSA(LR) mice, including a reduction in the CUG(exp) mRNA, a reduction in myotonic discharges, a shift toward adult pre-mRNA splicing patterns, reduced myofiber hypertrophy, and a decrease in myonuclear foci containing the CUG(exp) mRNA. Significant reversal of hallmarks of DM1 in the rAAV RNAi-treated HSA(LR) mice indicate that defects characteristic of DM1 can be mitigated with a systemic RNAi approach targeting the nuclei of terminally differentiated myofibers. Efficient rAAV-mediated delivery of RNAi has the potential to provide a long-term therapy for DM1 and other dominant muscular dystrophies.

Title #1315: Understanding paratyphoid infection: study protocol for the development of a human model of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A challenge in healthy adult volunteers.
PMID: 26082464
Authors: David D. McCullagh, Hazel C HC. Dobinson, Thomas T. Darton, Danielle D. Campbell, Claire C. Jones, Matthew M. Snape, Zoe Z. Stevens, Emma E. Plested, Merryn M. Voysey, Simon S. Kerridge, Laura B LB. Martin, Brian B. Angus, Andrew J AJ. Pollard
Abstract: This study will develop the first human challenge model of paratyphoid infection which may then be taken forward to evaluate paratyphoid vaccine candidates. Salmonella Paratyphi A is believed to cause a quarter of the estimated 20 million cases of enteric fever annually. Epidemiological evidence also suggests that an increasing proportion of the enteric fever burden is attributable to S. Paratyphi infection meriting further attention and interest in vaccine development. Assessment of paratyphoid vaccine efficacy in preclinical studies is complicated by the lack of a small animal model and the human-restricted nature of the infection. The use of experimental human infection in healthy volunteers provides an opportunity to address these problems in a cost-effective manner.

Abstract: Transcriptional activation by transcription factors is coupled with histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. However, the relationship between TGF-Î²1-induced gene transcription by KrÃ¼ppel-like factor (KLF)-4 and histone acetylation remains unknown. In our study, KLF4 overexpression or knockdown, respectively increased or decreased H3 acetylation and p300 occupancy, which is concentrated in the region containing TGF-Î²1 control elements (TCEs) of the genes by TGF-Î²1 regulation during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) formed a complex with KLF4 to inhibit the phosphorylation of the latter in basal conditions. After TGF-Î²1 signaling activation, PTEN was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK or PI3K/Akt signaling, phosphorylated PTEN lost its ability to dephosphorylate KLF4, and the cofactors interacting with KLF4 switched from PTEN to p300. Then, KLF4-p300 complexes were recruited to KLF4-binding sites of the gene promoter of VSMCs, to acetylate histone H3 and activate transcription. In addition, phosphorylated KLF4 enhanced p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity via the p38 MAPK pathway, which may be responsible for H3 acetylation. Taken together, the results of our study reveal a novel mechanism whereby KLF4 mediates the link between TGF-Î²1-induced gene transcription activation and H3 acetylation during VSMC differentiation.-He, M., Zheng, B., Zhang, Y., Zhang, X.-H., Wang, C., Yang, Z., Sun, Y., Wu, X.-L., Wen, J.-K. KLF4 mediates the link between TGF-Î²1-induced gene transcription and H3 acetylation in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Title #1322: Comparative performance of fetal goat tongue cell line ZZ-R 127 and fetal porcine kidney cell line LFBK-Î±vÎ²6 for Foot-and-mouth disease virus isolation.
PMID: 26082457
Authors: Katsuhiko K. Fukai, Kazuki K. Morioka, Manabu M. Yamada, Tatsuya T. Nishi, Kazuo K. Yoshida, Rie R. Kitano, Reiko R. Yamazoe, Toru T. Kanno
Abstract: The fetal goat tongue cell line ZZ-R 127 and the fetal porcine kidney cell line LFBK-Î±vÎ²6 have been reported to have high sensitivity to various Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strains. The suitability of ZZ-R 127 cells for FMDV isolation not only from epithelial suspensions but also from other clinical samples has already been confirmed in a previous study. However, to our knowledge, the suitability of LFBK-Î±vÎ²6 cells has not been evaluated using clinical samples other than epithelial materials. In addition, both cell lines have never been compared, in terms of use for FMDV isolation, under the same conditions. Therefore, in the current study, the virus isolation rates of both cell lines were compared using clinical samples collected from animals infected experimentally with FMDV. Viruses were successfully isolated from clinical samples other than epithelial suspensions for both cell lines. The virus isolation rates for the 2 cell lines were not significantly different. The Cohen kappa coefficients between the virus isolation results for both cell lines were significantly high. Taken together, these results confirmed the suitability of LFBK-Î±vÎ²6 cells for FMDV isolation from clinical samples other than epithelial suspensions. The levels of susceptibility of both cell lines to FMDV isolation were also confirmed to be almost the same.


Title #1323: Towards a differentiated capitation system: relation between patient characteristics, contacts and costs.
PMID: 26082456
Authors: Marijke M. Olthof, Feikje F. Groenhof, Marjolein Y MY. Berger
Abstract: A new payment system could curb primary health care costs. A differentiated capitation system based on patient characteristics could be the best mix for payment. To test the feasibility of such a system, we examined the number of contacts between patients and general practitioners (GPs), the related costs and the relationship with age, sex and comorbidity.


Title #1324: Radiosensitization of Human Colorectal Cancer Cells by MLN4924: An Inhibitor of NEDD8-Activating Enzyme.
PMID: 26082455
Authors: Juefeng J. Wan, Ji J. Zhu, Guichao G. Li, Zhen Z. Zhang
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer and the combination of radiation with capecitabine has been shown to achieve only 15% to 25% of pathologic complete response. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MLN4924, a potent small molecule inhibitor of SKP1-Cullin-F-box proteins E3 ubiquitin ligases, as a novel radiosensitizing agent in colorectal cancer cells. Indeed, we found that MLN4924 effectively sensitized colorectal cancer cells to radiation with a sensitivity-enhancement ratio of 1.61 for HT-29 cells and 1.35 for HCT-116 cells. Mechanistically, MLN4924 significantly enhanced radiation-induced G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage response through accumulation of p27. Knockdown of p27 via small interfering RNA partially inhibited MLN4924-induced radiosensitization, indicating a causal role played by p27. Our study suggested that MLN4924 could be further developed as a novel radiosensitizing agent against colorectal cancer.


Title #1325: Study on Wangzaozin-A-Inducing Cancer Apoptosis and Its Theoretical Protein Targets.
PMID: 26082454
Authors: Jing J. Chen, Shixia S. Wang, Xiaoquan X. Lu
Abstract: Wangzaozin A is the most representative cytotoxic C-20-nonoxide compound of Isodon plants of Labiatae. The protein targets of the 2 isomers (X and X') of Wangzaozin A are, respectively, extracted from target fishing dock Web site. Each isomer has 23 targets with good energy scores. The binding modes of each isomer and its targets are, respectively, analyzed by Dock. The energy score of the binding mode between the isomer X and the inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase is the smallest. The apoptosis, antiproliferative, and lethal effects of human gastric cancer cells induced by Wangzaozin A are assessed by trypan blue exclusion, hoechst33258 stain in SGC-7901, and flow cytometric measurement. The mechanism of Wangzaozin-A-inducing cancer apoptosis is analyzed. Wangzaozin A inhibits the growth of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell lines at the lower concentration (<4.0 Âµmol/L) and results in the lethal effect at the relative higher concentration (>8.0 Âµmol/L).

PMID: 26082453
Authors: Ling X LX. Kong, Alexandra A. Perebikovsky, Jacob J. Moebius, Lawrence L. Kulinsky, Marc M. Madou
Abstract: The field of centrifugal microfluidics has experienced tremendous growth during the past 15 years, especially in applications such as lab-on-a-disc (LoD) diagnostics. The strength of LoD systems lies in its potential for development into fully integrated sample-to-answer analysis systems. This review highlights the technologies necessary to develop the next generation of these systems. In addition to outlining valving and other fluid-handling operations, we discuss the recent advances and future outlook in four categories of LoD processes: reagent storage, sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification, and analyte detection strategies.


Title #1327: Complement C3dg-mediated erythrophagocytosis: implications for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
PMID: 26082452
Authors: Zhuoer Z. Lin, Christoph Q CQ. Schmidt, Sophia S. Koutsogiannaki, Patrizia P. Ricci, Antonio M AM. Risitano, John D JD. Lambris, Daniel D. Ricklin
Abstract: The clinical management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare but life-threatening hematological disease, has fundamentally improved with the introduction of a therapeutic that prevents complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. However, a considerable fraction of PNH patients show insufficient treatment response and remain transfusion-dependent. Since the current treatment only prevents C5-induced lysis but not upstream C3 activation, it has been speculated that ongoing opsonization with C3 fragments leads to recognition and phagocytosis of PNH erythrocytes by immune cells. Here, for the first time, we provide experimental evidence for such extravascular hemolysis and demonstrate that PNH erythrocytes from anti-C5-treated patients are phagocytosed by activated monocytes in vitro. Importantly, we show that this uptake is mediated by the end-stage opsonin C3dg, which is not traditionally considered a phagocytic marker, via interaction with complement receptor 3 (CR3). Interaction studies confirmed that C3dg itself can act as a ligand for the binding domain of CR3. The degree of C3dg-mediated erythrophagocytosis in samples from different PNH patients correlated well with the individual level of C3dg opsonization. This finding may guide future treatment options for PNH but also has potential implications for the description and management of other complement-mediated diseases.


Title #1328: Whole genome sequencing reveals oncogenic mutations in mycosis fungoides.

Abstract: The pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), is unknown. Although genetic alterations have been identified, none are considered consistently causative in MF. To identify potential drivers of MF, we performed whole genome sequencing of MF tumors and matched normal skin. Targeted ultra-deep sequencing of MF samples and exome sequencing of CTCL cell lines were also performed. Multiple mutations were identified that affected the same pathways, including epigenetic, cell-fate regulation, and cytokine signaling, in MF tumors and CTCL cell lines. Specifically, IL-2 signaling pathway mutations, including activating JAK3 mutations, were detected. Treatment with a JAK3 inhibitor significantly reduced CTCL cell survival. Additionally, the mutation data identified two other potential contributing factors to MF, UV and a TP53 polymorphism. Therefore, genetic alterations in specific pathways in MF were identified that may be viable, effective new targets for treatment.


Title #1329: Corporate responsibility for childhood physical activity promotion in the UK.

Abstract: The alarming epidemic of obesity and physical inactivity at paediatric age urges societies to rise to the challenge of ensuring an active lifestyle. As one response to this, business enterprises are increasingly engaged in promoting sport and physical activity (PA) initiatives within the frame of corporate social responsibility (CSR). However, comparative analyses among industry sectors of CSR strategies for PA promotion with a particular focus on children are still lacking. This study aimed to explore (i) what are the CSR strategies for PA promotion adopted in different industry sectors and (ii) whether corporate engagement in promoting PA for children is supportive of children's rights to play and be physically active. Corporate pledges pertaining to CSR initiatives to promote PA were analysed. The hypothesis was that companies from different sectors employ different CSR strategies and that companies with a higher profile as regard to public health concerns for children tend to legitimate their action by adopting a compensatory strategy. Results show that the issue of PA promotion is largely represented within CSR commitments. CSR strategies for PA promotion vary across industry sectors and the adoption of a compensatory strategy for rising childhood obesity allows only a limited exploitation of the potential of CSR commitments for the provision of children's rights to play and be physically active. Actors within the fields of public health ethics, human rights and CSR should be considered complementary to develop mainstreaming strategies and improve monitoring systems of PA promotion in children.


Title #1330: The DECIDE evidence to recommendation framework adapted to the public health field in Sweden.
PMID: 26082448
Authors: Karin K. Guldbrandsson, Nils N. StenstrÃ¶m, Regina R. Winzer
Abstract: Organizations worldwide compile results from scientific studies, and grade the evidence of interventions, in order to assist policy makers. However, quality of evidence alone is seldom sufficient to make a recommendation. The Developing and Evaluating Communication Strategies to Support Informed Decisions and Practice Based on Evidence (DECIDE) framework aims to facilitate decision making and to improve dissemination and implementation of recommendations in the healthcare and public health sector. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the DECIDE framework is applicable in the public health field in Sweden. The DECIDE framework was presented and discussed in interviews with stakeholders and governmental organizations and tested in panels. Content analyses were performed. In general, the informants were positive to the DECIDE framework. However, two questions, the first regarding individual autonomy and the second regarding method sustainability, were by the stakeholders felt to be missing in the framework. The importance of the composition of the DECIDE stakeholder panel was lifted by the informants, as was the significant role of the chair. Further, the informants raised concerns about the general lack of research evidence based on RCT design regarding universal methods in the public health sector. Finally, the local, regional and national levels' responsibility for dissemination and implementation of recommendations were lifted by the informants. The DECIDE framework might be useful as a tool for dissemination and implementation of recommendations in the public health field in Sweden. Important questions for further research are whether these findings are suitable for other public health topics and in other public health settings.

Title #1335: Cyber-Defense: A Taxonomy of Tactics for Managing Cyberstalking.
PMID: 26082443
Authors: Robert S RS. Tokunaga, Krystyna S KS. Aune
Abstract: Cyberstalking research has revealed information about who is perpetrating what offense to whom. This study adds to research on cyberstalking by exploring how victims respond to the unwanted pursuit. The reflections of cyberstalking victims were content analyzed to answer research questions about different risk management behaviors, their effectiveness, and their relationship with specific cyberstalking behaviors. Findings indicated that victims used seven general management tactics of which ignore/avoidance, active technological disassociation, and help seeking were the most common. Using technology to move away from pursuers was reported as the most effective tactic for managing the unwanted relational pursuit. The results also suggested that victims' management responses were associated with the type of behaviors experienced.


Title #1336: Attitude to Non-Violence Scale: Validity and Practical Use.
PMID: 26082442
Authors: Rhonda G RG. Craven, Marjorie M. Seaton, Alexander S AS. Yeung
Abstract: This study used recent advances in attitude and self-perception research to develop an Attitude to Non-Violence Scale (ANVS). Participants were students from six high schools in Australia (N = 727). Confirmatory factor analysis using within-construct and between-construct validation approaches found two positive attitude sub-scales: Cognitive (proactive understanding) and Affective (do not endorse violence), both showing convergent and discriminant validity. Scale equivalence tests found that the sub-scales were applicable to boys and girls and to junior and senior grades. Structural equation modeling found that boys had less supportive attitudes to non-violence cognitively, whereas female students in senior secondary classes had less positive attitudes to non-violence affectively. The ANVS can be easily administered to assess youth's non-violence attitudes, which may direct interventions focusing on boys' cognitive aspects while maintaining girls' positive affective attitudes toward non-violence as they mature. The positively framed instrument is suitable for education settings especially in high-risk locations where violence is prevalent.


Title #1337: Small molecule/ML327 mediated transcriptional de-repression of E-cadherin and inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Abstract: Transcriptional repression of E-cadherin is a hallmark of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and is associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying E-cadherin repression during EMT may provide insights into the development of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer. Here, we report on the chemical probe, ML327, which de-represses E-cadherin transcription, partially reverses EMT, and inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and tumor cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Induction of E-cadherin mRNA expression by ML327 treatment does not require de novo protein synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ML327 treatment significantly alters expression of over 2,500 genes within three hours in the presence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide. Network analysis reveals Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-alpha (HNF4Î±) as the most significant upstream transcriptional regulator of multiple genes whose expressions were altered by ML327 treatment. Further, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of HNF4Î± markedly attenuates the E-cadherin expression response to ML327. In summary, ML327 represents a valuable tool to understand mechanisms of EMT and may provide the basis for a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for carcinomas.

Title #1341: Neoplastic human embryonic stem cells as a model of radiation resistance of human cancer stem cells.

Abstract: Studies have implicated that a small sub-population of cells within a tumour, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), have an enhanced capacity for tumour formation in multiple cancers and may be responsible for recurrence of the disease after treatment, including radiation. Although comparisons have been made between CSCs and bulk-tumour, the more important comparison with respect to therapy is between tumour-sustaining CSC versus normal stem cells that maintain the healthy tissue. However, the absence of normal known counterparts for many CSCs has made it difficult to compare the radiation responses of CSCs with the normal stem cells required for post-radiotherapy tissue regeneration and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that transformed human embryonic stem cells (t-hESCs), showing features of neoplastic progression produce tumours resistant to radiation relative to their normal counterpart upon injection into immune compromised mice. We reveal that t-hESCs have a reduced capacity for radiation induced cell death via apoptosis and exhibit altered cell cycle arrest relative to hESCs in vitro. t-hESCs have an increased expression of BclXL in comparison to their normal counterparts and re-sensitization of t-hESCs to radiation upon addition of BH3-only mimetic ABT737, suggesting that overexpression of BclXL underpins t-hESC radiation insensitivity. Using this novel discovery platform to investigate radiation resistance in human CSCs, our study indicates that chemotherapy targeting Bcl2-family members may prove to be an adjuvant to radiotherapy capable of targeting CSCs.


Title #1342: Toll-like receptor 4 senses oxidative stress mediated by the oxidation of phospholipids in extracellular vesicles.
PMID: 26082436

Abstract: Oxidative stress produced in response to infection or sterile injury activates the innate immune response. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or secreted from cells subjected to oxidative stress contained oxidized phospholipids that stimulated cells expressing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in a manner dependent on its co-receptor MD-2. EVs from healthy subjects or reconstituted synthetic EVs subjected to limited oxidation gained the ability to stimulate TLR4-expressing cells, whereas prolonged oxidation abrogated this property. Furthermore, we found that 15-lipoxygenase generated hydro(pero)xylated phospholipids that stimulated TLR4-expressing cells. Molecular modeling suggested that the mechanism of activation of TLR4 by oxidized phospholipids in EVs was structurally similar to that of the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This was supported by experiments showing that EV-mediated stimulation of cells required MD-2, that mutations that block LPS binding to TLR4 abrogated the stimulatory effect of EVs, and that EVs induced TLR4 dimerization. On the other hand, analysis of gene expression profiles showed that genes encoding factors that resolve inflammation were more abundantly expressed in responses to EVs than in response to LPS. Together, these data suggest that EVs act as an oxidative stress-induced endogenous danger signal that underlies the pervasive role of TLR4 in inflammatory diseases.


Title #1343: Analysis of single-cell cytokine secretion reveals a role for paracrine signaling in coordinating macrophage responses to TLR4 stimulation.

Abstract: Macrophages not only produce multiple cytokines but also respond to multiple cytokines, which likely shapes the ultimate response of the population. To determine the role of paracrine signaling in shaping the profile of inflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages in response to stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we combined multiplexed, microwell-based measurements of cytokine secretion by single cells with analysis of cytokine secretion by cell populations. Loss of paracrine signaling as a result of cell isolation reduced the secretion by macrophage-like U937 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) of a subset of LPS-stimulated cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10. Graphical Gaussian modeling (GGM) of the single-cell data defined a regulatory network of paracrine signals, which was validated experimentally in the population through antibody-mediated neutralization of individual cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) was the most influential cytokine in the GGM network. Paracrine signaling by TNF-Î± secreted from a small subpopulation of "high-secreting" cells was necessary, but not sufficient, for the secretion of large amounts of IL-6 and IL-10 by the cell population. Decreased relative IL-10 secretion by isolated MDMs was linked to increased TNF-Î± secretion, suggesting that inhibition of the inflammatory response also depends on paracrine signaling. Our results reveal a previously uncharacterized role for cell-to-cell communication within a population in coordinating a rapid innate immune response despite underlying cell-to-cell heterogeneity.


Title #1344: Binding of the sphingolipid S1P to hTERT stabilizes telomerase at the nuclear periphery by allosterically mimicking protein phosphorylation.
PMID: 26082434

Abstract: During DNA replication, the enzyme telomerase maintains the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres. Shortened telomeres trigger cell senescence, and cancer cells often have increased telomerase activity to promote their ability to proliferate indefinitely. The catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), is stabilized by phosphorylation. We found that the lysophospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), generated by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), bound hTERT at the nuclear periphery in human and mouse fibroblasts. Docking predictions and mutational analyses revealed that binding occurred between a hydroxyl group (C'3-OH) in S1P and Asp(684) in hTERT. Inhibiting or depleting SK2 or mutating the S1P binding site decreased the stability of hTERT in cultured cells and promoted senescence and loss of telomere integrity. S1P binding inhibited the interaction of hTERT with makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that tags hTERT for degradation. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells formed smaller tumors in mice lacking SK2 than in wild-type mice, and knocking down SK2 in LLC cells before implantation into mice suppressed their growth. Pharmacologically inhibiting SK2 decreased the growth of subcutaneous A549 lung cancer cell-derived xenografts in mice, and expression of wild-type hTERT, but not an S1P-binding mutant, restored tumor growth. Thus, our data suggest that S1P binding to hTERT allosterically mimicks phosphorylation, promoting telomerase stability and hence telomere maintenance, cell proliferation, and tumor growth.


Title #1345: A bacterial gene codA encoding cytosine deaminase is an effective conditional negative selectable marker in Glycine max.
PMID: 26082433
Authors: Min M. Shao, Jean-Michel JM. Michno, Sara K SK. Hotton, Ann A. Blechl, James J. Thomson
Abstract: Research describes the practical application of the codA negative selection marker in Soybean. Conditions are given for codA selection at both the shooting and rooting stages of regeneration. Conditional negative selection is a powerful technique whereby the absence of a gene product allows survival in otherwise lethal conditions. In plants, the Escherichia coli gene codA has been employed as a negative selection marker. Our research demonstrates that codA can be used as a negative selection marker in soybean, Glycine max. Like most plants, soybean does not contain cytosine deaminase activity and we show here that wild-type seedlings are not affected by inclusion of 5-FC in growth media. In contrast, transgenic G. max plants expressing codA and grown in the presence of more than 200Â Î¼g/mL 5-FC exhibit reductions in hypocotyl and taproot lengths, and severe suppression of lateral root development. We also demonstrate a novel negative selection-rooting assay in which codA-expressing aerial tissues or shoot cuttings are inhibited for root formation in media containing 5-FC. Taken together these techniques allow screening during either the regeneration or rooting phase of tissue culture.


Title #1346: [Delayed neurological syndrome after CO intoxication of elderly female].
PMID: 26082431
Authors: Liesbeth Vander LV. Weyden, Roxana-Maria RM. Voigt, Steven S. Boonen, Katleen K. Fagard, Eddy E. Dejaeger
Abstract: This article discusses the case history of an 87-year old woman with loss of consciousness following accidental CO intoxication. A few weeks later, the patient's cognitive abilities progressively deteriorated. This is hence a case of Delayed Neurological Symptoms after CO intoxication. This condition occurs in 40â% of patients with CO intoxication and manifests itself 3-240 days after apparent recovery. Symptoms can linger for a long time and are in some cases even permanent. Treatment of CO intoxication usually consists of administering normobaric oxygen and in certain cases hyperbaric oxygen. The role of treatment with hyberbaric oxygen in delayed neurological symptoms after CO intoxication remains controversial, however.

Abstract: Drowning affects more than 500,000 people worldwide and is responsible for at least 350,000 deaths each year. In France, 1235 drowning resulting in 496 deaths were recorded in the summer 2012. This retrospective study has investigated the epidemiology of drowning in the city of Marseille (South of France) between 2000 and 2011. We identified 449 cases of unintentional drowning. The highest incidence was found among males with a median age of 36 years. The incidence was 5.3 victims per 10,000 inhabitants with a mortality rate of 1.2 per 10,000. These accidents occurred mainly at sea (89%) and during the summer season. A majority of drowning victims (69%) were admitted in a hospital. This is the only study in France to analyse data on drowning throughout the year and over a long period. Drowning is a serious condition burdened by 22% of victims who die.

PMID: 26082428
Authors: Bianca T BT. Villalobos, Ana J AJ. Bridges
Abstract: This study tests the parameters of Weiner's attribution model of caregiving, which describes how attributions of controllability relate to emotional reactions, which in turn influence willingness to provide support to stigmatized individuals. To date, the model has not been explored in the context of cultural variables, the caregiver-recipient relationship, or types of support.


Title #1349: The Effect of the Methylation and N-H Acidic Group on the Physicochemical Properties of Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids.
PMID: 26082427
Authors: Ana Sofia Moreira Conde AS. Rodrigues, Marisa A A MA. Rocha, Hugo FerrÃ£o Dias HF. Almeida, Catarina M S S CM. Neves, JosÃ© A JA. Lopes da Silva, Mara G MG. Freire, Joao A P JA. Coutinho, Luis M N B F LM. Santos
Abstract: This work presents and highlights the differentiation of the physicochemical properties of the [C1Him][NTf2], [C2Him][NTf2], [1C12C1Him][NTf2], and [1C42C13C1im][NTf2] that are related with the strong bulk interaction potential, which highlights the differentiation on the physicochemical arising from the presence of the acidic group (N-H) as well as the methylation in position 2 (C(2)) of the imidazolium ring. Densities, viscosities, refractive indices and surface tensions in a wide range of temperatures, as well as, isobaric heat capacities at 298.15 K, for this IL series are presented and discussed. It was found that the volumetric properties are barely affected by the geometric and structural isomerization, following a quite regular trend. A linear correlation between the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the alkyl chain size was found; however, ILs with the acidic N-H group present a significant higher Tg than the [1CN-13C1im][NTf2] and [1CN3CNim][NTf2] series. It was found that the most viscous ILs, ([1C1Him][NTf2], [1C2Him][NTf2] and [1C12C1Him][NTf2]) have an acidic N-H group in the imidazolium ring in agreement with the observed increase of energy barrier of flow. The methylation in position 2, C(2), as well as, the N-H acidic group in the imidazolium ring, contribute to a significant variation in the cation-anion interactions and their dynamics, which is reflected in their charge distribution and polarizability leading to a significant differentiation of the refractive indices, surface tension and heat capacities. The observed differentiation of the physicochemical properties of the [1C1Him][NTf2], [1C2Him][NTf2], [1C12C1Him][NTf2], and [1C42C13C1im][NTf2] are an indication of the stronger bulk interaction potential, which highlights the effect that arises from the presence of the acidic group (N-H) as well as the methylation in position 2 of the imidazolium ring.


Title #1350: Differential necrophoric behaviour of the ant Solenopsis invicta towards fungal-infected corpses of workers and pupae.
PMID: 26082426
Authors: H-L HL. Qiu, L-H LH. Lu, Q-X QX. Shi, C-C CC. Tu, T. T. Lin, Y-R YR. He
Abstract: Necrophoric behaviour is critical sanitation behaviour in social insects. However, little is known about the necrophoric responses of workers towards different developmental stages in a colony as well as its underlying mechanism. Here, we show that Solenopsis invicta workers display distinct necrophoric responses to corpses of workers and pupae. Corpses of workers killed by freezing (dead for <1 h) were carried to a refuse pile, but pupal corpses would take at least 1 day to elicit workers' necrophoric response. Metarhizium anisopliae-infected pupal corpses accelerated the necrophoric behaviour of resident workers, with 47.5% of unaffected corpses and 73.8% infected corpses discarded by 1 day post-treatment). We found that fungus-infected pupal corpses had a higher concentration of fatty acids (palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) on their surface. We experimentally confirmed that linoleic and oleic acids would elicit a necrophoric response in workers. The appearance of linoleic and oleic acids appeared to be chemical signals involved in recognition of pupal corpses, and M. anisopliae infection could promote the accumulation of fatty acids on surface of pupal corpses resulting in accelerated necrophoric responses of workers.


Title #1351: Real-time cell analysis of the inhibitory effect of vitamin K2 on adhesion and proliferation of breast cancer cells.
PMID: 26082424

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type worldwide. Continued efforts to improve treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer will be instrumental in reducing the death rates associated with this disease. In particular, the triple-negative breast cancer subtype of breast cancer has no targeted therapy available so it is essential to continue to work on any potential therapies. Vitamin K (VK) is known for its essential role in the clotting cascade. The antitumor properties of VK derivatives have been reported in both hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma. Our hypothesis was that menaquinone-4, the most common form of vitamin K2 (VK2), is an effective anticancer agent against breast cancer cell types. In this study, we used a novel impedance-based live cell monitoring platform (xCELLigence) to determine the effects of VK derivatives on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and the HER2+ breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of menaquinone-4 (VK2) previously reported to have an antiproliferative effect on human glioblastoma cells. After initial testing, these concentrations were adjusted to 100, 125, and 150 Î¼mol/L. A significant dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effect was found when cells were treated at these concentrations. These effects were seen in both adhesion and proliferation phases and show a dramatic reduction in cell growth. Additional analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with VK2 (100 Î¼mol/L) in combination with a low-glucose nutrient media showed a further decrease in adhesion and viability. This is the first study of its kind showing the real-time effects of VK derivatives on breast cancer cells and suggests that dietary factors may be an important consideration for patients.


Title #1352: Adsorption-desorption and leaching behavior of kresoxim-methyl in different soils of India: kinetics and thermodynamic studies.
PMID: 26082423
Authors: Rupali P RP. Sabale, Ahammed A. Shabeer T P, Soma S. Dasgupta, Sagar C SC. Utture, Kaushik K. Banerjee, Dasharath P DP. Oulkar, Pandurang G PG. Adsule, Madhukar B MB. Deshmukh
Abstract: The sorption and leaching behavior of kresoxim-methyl was explored in four different soils, viz., clay, sandy loam, loamy sand, and sandy loam (saline), representing vegetables and fruits growing regions of India. Adsorption of kresoxim-methyl in all the soils reached equilibrium within 48Â h. The rate constants for adsorption and desorption at two different temperatures were obtained from the Lindstrom model, which simultaneously evaluated adsorption and desorption kinetics. The data for rate constants, activation energies, enthalpy of activation, entropy of activation, and free energy indicated physical adsorption of kresoxim-methyl on soil. The relative adsorptivity of the test soils could be attributed to different organic matter and clay contents of the soils. A good fit to the linear and Freundlich isotherms was observed for both adsorption as well as desorption. The groundwater ubiquity score (GUS) for different soils varied between 0 and 2.26. The GUS and leaching study indicated moderately low leaching potential of kresoxim-methyl. The adsorption on four soil types largely depended on the soil physicochemical properties such as organic carbon content, cation-exchange capacity, and texture of the soil.


Title #1353: Microplastic resin pellets on an urban tropical beach in Colombia.
PMID: 26082422
Authors: Isabel I. Acosta-Coley, Jesus J. Olivero-Verbel
Abstract: Microplastics are a problem in oceans worldwide. The current situation in Latin America is not well known. This paper reports, for the first time, the presence of microplastics on an urban Caribbean beach in Cartagena, Colombia. Pellet samples were collected from a tourist beach over a 5-month period covering both dry and rainy seasons. Pellets were classified by color and their surface analyzed by stereomicroscopy, and some were characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The most abundant pellets were white, presenting virgin surfaces, with few signs of oxidation. This is congruent with a short residence time in the marine environment and primary sources possibly located nearby. The frequency of white pellets did not change with sampling period. Surface features identified in the pellets included cracks, material loss, erosion, adhesion, granulation, color change, and glazed surfaces. Reticulated granular pellets exhibited the greatest degradation, easily generating submicroplastics. Sample composition was mostly polyethylene, followed by polypropylene. This pollution problem must be addressed by responsible authorities to avoid pellet deposition in oceans and on beaches around the world. Graphical abstract á.


Title #1354: Role of chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who have progressed after abiraterone acetate.
PMID: 26082421
Authors: Roberto R. Petrioli, Edoardo E. Francini, Letizia L. Laera, Anna Ida AI. Fiaschi, Roberto R. Ponchietti, Giandomenico G. Roviello
Abstract: Abiraterone acetate is a novel irreversible inhibitor of CYP17 that was recently approved for men with post-chemotherapy or chemo-naive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Unfortunately, this agent is not curative, and patients often ultimately develop resistance. However, men who progress after treatment with this new hormonal agent may be considered for another line of chemotherapy-based treatment. In 2004, docetaxel (D) and prednisone were found to improve survival compared with older regimens. More recently, cabazitaxel (C), a novel taxane chemotherapy, has been found to prolong survival in patients who exhibit disease progression during or after D chemotherapy. Here, we review the first clinical studies in which castration-resistant prostate cancer patients received chemotherapy with D or C after progression during abiraterone acetate treatment.

Title #1356: Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome; Treated with Re Lowering of Serum Sodium.
PMID: 26082419
Authors: Khalid Hamid KH. Changal, Hameed H. Raina, Irfan Yusuf IY. Wani
Abstract: This case report demonstrates that if serum sodium is re lowered early in the course of Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), many of its devastating consequences may be avoided. In animal models, initiation of re-lowering within four hours of symptom onset has been associated with better outcomes than initiation within eight to ten hours of symptom onset. As there is no effective therapy for the condition we suggest a trial of re lowering of serum sodium early in its course.


Title #1357: A Case Report of Japanese Encephalitis Focusing on MR Findings.
PMID: 26082418
Authors: Hsun-Hua HH. Lee, Li-Kai LK. Huang, Chaur-Jong CJ. Hu, Yen-Ting YT. Chen, Dean D. Wu
Abstract: meningitis or encephalitis with or without neurological deficits. JEV typically attacks the thalamus, corpus striatum, brainstem and spinal cord. The laboratory diagnosis of JEV infection involves the detection of anti-JEV antibody IgMs using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which has high sensitivity and specificity. Because of the lack of a specific antiviral therapy, JE is usually managed by symptomatic treatment and supportive care. We report a case of JE in a 34-year-old man. With a clinical presentation similar to herpes simplex virus encephalitis, the patient was finally diagnosed as having JE. The distinction of different viral encephalitides in MR findings is briefly reviewed.

Abstract: Coffee drinkers had a higher risk of lung cancer in some previous studies, but as heavy coffee drinkers tend to also be cigarette smokers, such findings could be confounded. Therefore, we examined this association in the nearly half a million participants of the US NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.

Abstract: Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated significant reductions in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality associated with polypectomy. However, little is known about whether polypectomy is effective at reducing CRC risk in routine clinical practice. The aim of this investigation was to quantify CRC risk following polypectomy in a large prospective population-based cohort study.


Title #1366: Completion of tricin biosynthesis pathway in rice: Cytochrome P450 75B4 is a novel chrysoeriol 5'-hydroxylase.
PMID: 26082402
Authors: Pui Ying PY. Lam, Hongjia H. Liu, Clive C. Lo
Abstract: Flavones are ubiquitously accumulated in land plants but their biosynthesis in monocot remained largely elusive until recent years. Recently, we demonstrated that the rice cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP93G1 and CYP93G2 channel flavanones en route to flavone O-linked conjugates and C-glycosides, respectively. In tricin, the 3', 5'-dimethoxyflavone nucleus is formed before O-linked conjugations. Previously, flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylases belonging to the CYP75A subfamily were believed to generate tricetin from apigenin for 3', 5'-O-methylation to form tricin. However, we report here that CYP75B4 a novel flavonoid B-ring hydroxylase indispensable for tricin formation in rice. A CYP75B4 knocked-out mutant is tricin-deficient with unusual accumulation of chrysoeriol (a 3'-methoxylated flavone). CYP75B4 functions as a bona fide flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) by restoring the accumulation of 3'-hydroxylated flavonoids in Arabidopsis tt7 mutants and catalyzing in vitro 3'-hydroxylation of different flavonoids. In addition, over-expression of both CYP75B4 and CYP93G1 (a flavone synthase II) in Arabidopsis resulted in tricin accumulation. Specific 5'-hydroxylation of chrysoeriol to selgin by CYP75B4 was further demonstrated in vitro. The reaction steps leading to tricin biosynthesis are then reconstructed as naringenin â apigenin â luteolin â chrysoeriol â selgin â tricin. Hence, chrysoeriol, instead of tricetin, is an intermediate in tricin biosynthesis. CYP75B4 homologous sequences are highly conserved in Poaceae and they are phylogenetically distinct from the canonical CYP75B F3'H sequences. Recruitment of chrysoeriol-specific 5'-hydroxylase activity by an ancestral CYP75B sequence may represent a key event leading to the prevalence of tricin-derived metabolites in grasses and other monocot today.


Title #1367: Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.

Abstract: Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient for all living cells, is indispensable for agricultural production. While Arabidopsis thaliana PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and its orthologs in other species have been shown to function in transcriptional regulation of phosphate (Pi) signaling and Pi homeostasis, an integrative comparison of PHR1-related proteins in rice has not previously been reported. Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice, OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3, using phylogenetic and mutation analysis. OsPHR3, in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes. Loss-of-function mutations in any one of these transcription factors (TFs) impaired root hair growth (primarily root hair elongation). However, these three TFs showed differences in DNA binding affinities and mRNA expression patterns in different tissues and growth stages, and transcriptomic analysis revealed differential effects on PSI gene expression of single mutants of the three TFs, indicating some degree of functional diversification. Overexpression of genes encoding any of these TFs resulted in partial constitutive activation of Pi starvation response and led to Pi accumulation in the shoot. Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions. We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice.


Title #1368: Selection for Improved Energy Use Efficiency and Drought Tolerance in Canola Results in Distinct Transcriptome and Epigenome Changes.

Abstract: To increase both the yield potential and stability of crops, integrated breeding strategies are used that have mostly a direct genetic basis, but the utility of epigenetics to improve complex traits is unclear. A better understanding of the status of the epigenome and its contribution to the agronomic performance would help in developing approaches to incorporate the epigenetic component of complex traits into breeding programs. Starting from isogenic canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) lines, epilines were generated by selecting, recurrently for three generations, lines with an increased energy use efficiency and drought tolerance. These epilines had an enhanced energy use efficiency, drought tolerance, nitrogen use efficiency, and yield under suboptimal conditions. Transcriptome analysis of the epilines and a line selected for its energy use efficiency solely revealed common differentially expressed genes related to the onset of stress tolerance-regulating signaling events. Genes related to responses to salt, osmotic, abscisic acid, and drought treatments were specifically differentially expressed in the drought-tolerant epilines. The status of the epigenome, scored as differential trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3, further supported the phenotype by targeting drought-responsive genes and facilitating the transcription of the differentially expressed genes. From these results, we conclude that the canola epigenome can be shaped by selection to increase yield and stress tolerance. Hence, these findings support the further development of strategies to incorporate epigenetics into breeding.


Title #1369: Different ROS-Scavenging Properties of Flavonoids Determine Their Abilities to Extend Shelf Life of Tomato.

Abstract: The shelf-life of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit is determined by the processes of over-ripening and susceptibility to pathogens. Post-harvest shelf life is one of the most important traits for commercially grown tomatoes. We compared the shelf life of tomato fruit that accumulate different flavonoids and found that delayed over-ripening is associated with increased total antioxidant capacity caused by the accumulation of flavonoids in the fruit. However, reduced susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea, a major post-harvest fungal pathogen of tomato, is conferred by specific flavonoids only. We demonstrate an association between flavonoid structure, selective scavenging ability for different free radicals and reduced susceptibility to B. cinerea. Our study provides mechanistic insight into how flavonoids influence shelf life of tomato, information which could be used to improve the shelf life of tomato, and potentially of other soft fruit.


Title #1370: Regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis by shade relies on specific subsets of antagonistic transcription factors and co-factors.

Abstract: Carotenoids are photosynthetic pigments essential for the protection against excess light. During deetiolation, their production is regulated by a dynamic repression-activation module formed by PIF1 and HY5. These transcription factors directly and oppositely control the expression of the gene encoding phytoene synthase (PSY), the first and main rate-determining enzyme of the carotenoid pathway. Antagonistic modules also regulate the responses of deetiolated plants to vegetation proximity and shade, i.e. to the perception of far-red enriched light filtered through or reflected from neighboring plants. These responses, aimed to adapt to eventual shading from plant competitors, include a reduced accumulation of carotenoids. Here we show that PIF1 and related photolabile PIFs (but not photostable PIF7) promote the shade-triggered decrease in carotenoid accumulation. While HY5 does not appear to be required for this process, other known PIF antagonists were found to modulate the expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana PSY gene and the biosynthesis of carotenoids early after exposure to shade. In particular, PAR1, a transcriptional co-factor that prevents binding of true transcription factors to their target promoters, was found to interact with PIF1 and hence directly induce PSY expression. By contrast, a change in the levels of the transcriptional co-factor HFR1, which also binds to PIF1 and other PIFs to regulate shade-related elongation responses, did not impact PSY expression or carotenoid accumulation. Our data suggest that fine regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in response to shade relies on specific modules of antagonistic transcriptional factors and co-factors.

Abstract: Chronic inguinodynia is one of the most frequent complications after groin herniorrhaphy. We investigated the retroperitoneal anatomy of the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve to prevent direct nerve injury during hernia repairs and to find the most advantageous approach for posterior triple neurectomy.


Title #1372: Quantification and kinetic study in plasma and tissues of (E)-1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-2-tetrazene, a liquid propellant and a transformation product of 1,1-dimethyl hydrazine.

Abstract: (E)-1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-2-tetrazene (TMTZ) is formed from the oxidation of the unsymmetrical 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and is used as a storable liquid fuel which can be considered as a new potential propellant for space rocket propulsion. To better understand the toxicological behavior of the compound, an intraperitoneal administration of TMTZ was performed in mice to define its toxicokinetics and tissue distribution. A fully validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed to determine TMTZ levels in biological samples. Determination of TMTZ was achieved using 50Â Î¼L of plasma or tissue solution. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate and acetonitrile was used for sample preparation. Liquid chromatography was performed on an Atlantis HILIC Silica column (Waters; 3Â Î¼m, 150Â mmâÃâ2.1Â mm i.d.). Isocratic elution with a mixture of ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5, 100Â mM)/water/acetonitrile (3:2:95, v/v/v) was used. The detection was conducted using an electrospray source in positive ion mode. TMTZ and (15)N2-TMTZ (internal standard) were quantitated in selected reaction monitoring mode using the transition m/z 117â72 and 119â74, respectively. Standard curves exhibited excellent linearity in the range of 10-500Â ng/mL for plasma and 50-2000Â ng/mL for all tissues (heart, liver, brain, kidney, and lung) analyzed, and acceptable precision and accuracy (<10Â %) were obtained. The elimination rate constant strongly suggests that TMTZ was very quickly eliminated from the body. The results of tissue distribution experiments indicated that TMTZ underwent a rapid distribution into limited organs such as the liver, kidney, and brain.


Title #1373: Tailored micro-extraction method for Raman/SERS detection of indigoids in ancient textiles.

Abstract: Indigoid dyes are well known as vat dyes. In their oxidized dichetonic form they are stable and insoluble in water, whereas in their reduced form, commonly known as leuco, they are soluble in water and able to be attached to fabric for dyeing purposes. These blue dyes are usually easily detectable in art objects by means of Raman spectroscopy by adopting for analyses a laser line at a high wavelength, such as a 785Â nm diode laser. Unfortunately, in ancient artworks, that areÂ often highly degraded, it is not always possible to collect high quality Raman spectra, which makes the analysis and identification of these compounds particularly challenging. In this work, we present a tailor-made methodology for the extraction and the recognition of indigoid dyes in works of art, which exploits the solubility of these compounds in their reduced form. Excellent Raman and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of indigo were acquired after micro-extraction on ancient and reference textiles, confirming the reliability of the presented procedure. Moreover, the methodology has been applied also for the extraction of the indigoid dye Tyrian purple on a reference textile, showing excellent results. This analytical method has been found to be extremely safe both for the reference textiles and the investigated ancient textiles,Â thus being a promising procedure for the selective analysis and detection of indigoid compounds in objects of artistic relevance.


Title #1374: Crystal structure of the effector AvrLm4-7 of Leptosphaeria maculans reveals insights into its translocation into plant cell and recognition by resistance proteins.

Abstract: The avirulence gene AvrLm4-7 of Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of stem canker of oilseed rape, confers a dual specificity of recognition by two resistance genes (Rlm4 and Rlm7) and is strongly involved in fungal fitness. In order to elucidate the biological function of AvrLm4-7 and understand the specificity of recognition by Rlm4 and Rlm7, the AvrLm4-7 protein was produced in Pichia pastoris and its crystal structure determined. It revealed the presence of four disulfide bridges but no close structural analogs could be identified. A short stretch of amino acids in the C-terminus of the protein, (R/N)(Y/F)(R/S)E(F/W), was well-conserved among AvrLm4-7 homologs. Loss of recognition of AvrLm4-7 by Rlm4 is due to mutation of a single glycine to an arginine residue located in a loop of the protein. Loss of recognition by Rlm7 is governed by more complex mutational patterns, including gene loss or drastic modifications of the protein structure. Three point mutations altered residues in the well-conserved C-terminal motif or close to the glycine involved in Rlm4-mediated recognition, resulted in a loss of Rlm7-mediated recognition. Transient expression in tobacco and particle bombardment experiments on oilseed rape leaves suggested that AvrLm4-7 interacts with its cognate R proteins inside the plant cell, and can be translocated into plant cells in the absence of the pathogen. Translocation of AvrLm4-7 into oilseed rape leaves likely requires the (R/N)(Y/F)(R/S)E(F/W) motif as well as a RAWG motif located in a nearby loop that together form a positively charged region.

Title #1375: Developing citizen report cards for primary care: evidence from qualitative research in rural Tajikistan.
PMID: 26082392
Authors: Sebastian S. Bauhoff, Olesya O. Tkacheva, Lila L. Rabinovich, Olena O. Bogdan
Abstract: Transparency interventions, such as public reporting, have emerged as a potential policy approach to improving the performance of health care providers in resource-constrained settings. We report on results from focus groups and key informant interviews in rural areas of two Tajik provinces, Soghd and Khatlon, with regards to three important initial considerations for developing a report card initiative for primary health care in this setting: selecting indicators for the report card, collecting data, and working with existing institutions and stakeholders. The findings suggest that citizens are able to articulate and prioritize concerns with respect to local health care services. Participants indicated a preference for arms-length collection of sensitive feedback on local providers. Because citizens and local institutions have close and important relations with their local health care providers, there may be scope for a trusted external actor, such as a non-governmental organization, to facilitate the report card process.


Title #1376: National malaria vector control policy: an analysis of the decision to scale-up larviciding in Nigeria.
PMID: 26082391
Authors: Kemi K. Tesfazghi, Jenny J. Hill, Caroline C. Jones, Hilary H. Ranson, Eve E. Worrall
Abstract: New vector control tools are needed to combat insecticide resistance and reduce malaria transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses larviciding as a supplementary vector control intervention using larvicides recommended by the WHO Pesticides Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). The decision to scale-up larviciding in Nigeria provided an opportunity to investigate the factors influencing policy adoption and assess the role that actors and evidence play in the policymaking process, in order to draw lessons that help accelerate the uptake of new methods for vector control.

Title #1378: Microgaps and Demineralization Progress around Composite Restorations.
PMID: 26082389
Authors: A. A. Turkistani, S. S. Nakashima, Y. Y. Shimada, J. J. Tagami, A. A. Sadr
Abstract: This study investigated the influence of adhesives and marginal sealing on demineralization progress using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Cavities (4 Ã 2 mm) were prepared in bovine incisors and restored using Clearfil SE Protect (SP), Bond Force (BF), Scotchbond Universal (SB), or G-Bond Plus (GB), followed by Estelite Flow Quick flowable composite. The control group received no adhesive (n = 10). After 3-d incubation in artificial saliva and 10,000 thermal cycles, gaps at enamel and dentin margins were measured at 8 locations on cross-sectional images obtained from each restoration using swept-source OCT at 1310-nm wavelength. Specimens were demineralized using acidified gel (pH = 4.5) for 5 wk and scanned every week to monitor the lesion progress at the same marginal locations. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that demineralization period and adhesive type and their interaction had a significant effect on the lesion size in both substrates (P < 0.001). SP, BF, and SB had significantly lower enamel and dentin initial gaps than the control and GB (P < 0.05). Enamel lesion progress was slower in the fluoride-releasing adhesives SP and BF and significantly different from SB, GB, and the control (P < 0.001). SP and BF dentin lesions were significantly different from GB and the control (P < 0.001), but not from SB (P > 0.05). A significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) was found between initial gap length and formed lesion size in both substrates, which was stronger in enamel (r = 0.63) than dentin (r = 0.35). Microgaps forming at the margins of restorations depend on adhesives and significantly contribute to the progress of demineralization around the margins, while fluoride release may decrease the rate of progression.


Title #1379: Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal of Economic Evaluation Publications in Dentistry.
PMID: 26082388

Abstract: Economic evaluation (EE) studies have been undertaken in dentistry since the late 20th century because economic data provide additional information to policy makers to develop guidelines and set future direction for oral health services. The objectives of this study were to assess the methodological quality of EEs in oral health. Electronic searching of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database from 1975 to 2013 were undertaken to identify publications that include costs and outcomes in dentistry. Relevant reference lists were also searched for additional studies. Studies were retrieved and reviewed independently for inclusion by 3 authors. Furthermore, to appraise the EE methods, 1 author applied the Drummond 10-item (13-criteria) checklist tool to each study. Of the 114 publications identified, 79 studies were considered full EE and 35 partial. Twenty-eight studies (30%) were published between the years 2011 and 2013. Sixty-four (53%) studies focused on dental caries prevention or treatment. Median appraisal scores calculated for full and partial EE studies were 11 and 9 out of 13, respectively. Quality assessment scores showed that the quality of partial EE studies published after 2000 significantly improved (P = 0.02) compared to those published before 2000. Significant quality improvement was not found in full EE studies. Common methodological limitations were identified: absence of sensitivity analysis, discounting, and insufficient information on how costs and outcomes were measured and valued. EE studies in dentistry increased over the last 40 y in both quantity and quality, but a number of publications failed to satisfy some components of standard EE research methods, such as sensitivity analysis and discounting.


Title #1380: Periodontal Bacteria and Prediabetes Prevalence in ORIGINS: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance, and Insulin Resistance Study.

Abstract: Periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. The relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been studied. We investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. ORIGINS (the Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study) cross sectionally enrolled 300 diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean Â± SD, 34 Â± 10 y; 77% female). Prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin A1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dL. In 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / American Academy of Periodontology. Modified Poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. All analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. All results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. Prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. Prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: A. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), P = 0.004; P. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), P = 0.0003; T. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), P = 0.052; T. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), P = 0.05; A. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), P = 0.01. The prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), P = 0.23. Higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.


Title #1381: Spectrum of Dental Phenotypes in Nonsyndromic Orofacial Clefting.
PMID: 26082386
Authors: B J BJ. Howe, M E ME. Cooper, A R AR. Vieira, S M SM. Weinberg, J M JM. Resick, N L NL. Nidey, G L GL. Wehby, M L ML. Marazita, L M LM. Moreno Uribe
Abstract: Children with oral clefts show a wide range of dental anomalies, adding complexity to understanding the phenotypic spectrum of orofacial clefting. The evidence is mixed, however, on whether the prevalence of dental anomalies is elevated in unaffected relatives and is mostly based on small samples. In the largest international cohort to date of children with nonsyndromic clefts, their relatives, and controls, this study characterizes the spectrum of cleft-related dental anomalies and evaluates whether families with clefting have a significantly higher risk for such anomalies compared with the general population. A total of 3,811 individuals were included: 660 cases with clefts, 1,922 unaffected relatives, and 1,229 controls. Dental anomalies were identified from in-person dental exams or intraoral photographs, and case-control differences were tested using Ï(2) statistics. Cases had higher rates of dental anomalies in the maxillary arch than did controls for primary (21% vs. 4%, P = 3 Ã 10(-8)) and permanent dentitions (51% vs. 8%, P = 4 Ã 10(-62)) but not in the mandible. Dental anomalies were more prevalent in cleft lip with cleft palate than other cleft types. More anomalies were seen in the ipsilateral side of the cleft. Agenesis and tooth displacements were the most common dental anomalies found in case probands for primary and permanent dentitions. Compared with controls, unaffected siblings (10% vs. 2%, P = 0.003) and parents (13% vs. 7%, P = 0.001) showed a trend for increased anomalies of the maxillary permanent dentition. Yet, these differences were nonsignificant after multiple-testing correction, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in some families carrying susceptibility to both overt clefts and dental anomalies. Collectively, the findings suggest that most affected families do not have higher genetic risk for dental anomalies than the general population and that the higher prevalence of anomalies in cases is primarily a physical consequence of the cleft and surgical interventions.

Title #1384: Vaccination as primary prevention? the effect of anti-pneumococcal vaccination on the outcome of patients suffering traumatic skull base fractures.
PMID: 26082383
Authors: O. O. Cohen-Inbar, A. A. Kachel, L. L. Levi, M. M. Zaaroor
Abstract: As many as 360,000 people suffer yearly from skull base fractures (SBF). These may be associated with a dural tear, hemosinus, otorrhea or rhinorrhea. The most common causative agent of post-traumatic meningitis is Streptococcus Pneumonia (Pneumococcus). PNEUMOVAX 23 is a potent vaccine against Pneumococcus, but head trauma involving any skull fractures are not defined indications for its use. Our aim was to identify the effect of PNEUMOVAX on the natural course and incidence of infections and infectious prognosis following SBF.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undifferentiated, multipotent cells, which have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into many tissue types. MSCs have shown therapeutic applications in different medical fields and could represent a successful treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD). Several studies have demonstrated, ex vivo or in animal models, the MSCs efficacy in spine surgery. The authors aim to demonstrate their efficacy in humans.

Abstract: First advocated by Santoni et al. in 2009, the cortical bone trajectory (CBT) pedicle screw technique is an alternative to the traditional, convergent technique that shows comparable biomechanical features and potentially requires less aggressive tissue retraction. Aim of this therapeutical note is to describe this new technique focusing on main advantages and limitations.


Title #1388: Does evolution lead to maximizing behavior?
PMID: 26082379
Authors: Laurent L. Lehmann, Ingela I. Alger, Jorgen J. Weibull
Abstract: A long-standing question in biology and economics is whether individual organisms evolve to behave as if they were striving to maximize some goal function. We here formalize this "as if" question in a patch-structured population in which individuals obtain material payoffs from (perhaps very complex multimove) social interactions. These material payoffs determine personal fitness and, ultimately, invasion fitness. We ask what goal function, if any, individuals will appear to be maximizing, in uninvadable population states, when what is really being maximized is invasion fitness at the genetic level. We reach two broad conclusions. First, no simple and general individual-centered goal function emerges from the analysis. This stems from the fact that invasion fitness is a gene-centered multi-generational measure of evolutionary success. Second, when selection is weak, all multigenerational effects of selection can be summarized in a neutral type-distribution quantifying identity-by-descent between individuals within patches. Individuals then behave as if they were striving to maximize a weighted sum of material payoffs (own and others). At an uninvadable state it is as if individuals would freely choose their actions and play a Nash equilibrium of a game with a goal function that combines self-interest (own material payoff), group interest (group material payoff if everyone does the same), and local rivalry (material payoff differences).

Title #1389: Marketed Drugs Can Inhibit Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1), a Potential New Target for Breast Cancer Adjuvant Therapy.
PMID: 26082378
Authors: Natalia N. Mast, Joseph B JB. Lin, Irina A IA. Pikuleva
Abstract: Cytochrome P450 CYP27A1 is the only enzyme in humans converting cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol, an oxysterol of multiple functions including tissue-specific modulation of estrogen and liver X receptors. Both receptors were found to mediate adverse effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol in breast cancer when the levels of this oxysterol are elevated. The present work assessed druggability of CYP27A1 as a potential anti-breast cancer target. We selected 26 anti-cancer and non-cancer medications, most approved by the FDA, and evaluated them first in vitro for inhibition of purified recombinant CYP27A1 and binding to the enzyme active site. Six strong CYP27A1 inhibitors/binders were identified. These were the two anti-breast cancer pharmaceuticals anastrozole and fadrozole, anti-prostate cancer drug bicalutamide, sedative dexmedetomidine, and two anti-fungals ravuconazole and posaconazole. Anastrozole was then tested in vivo on mice, which received subcutaneous drug injections for one week. Mouse plasma and hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol levels were decreased 2.6- and 1.6-fold, respectively, whereas plasma and hepatic cholesterol content remained unchanged. Thus, pharmacologic CYP27A1 inhibition is possible in the whole body and individual organs but does not negatively affect cholesterol elimination. Our results enhance the potential of CYP27A1 as an anti-breast cancer target, could be of importance for the interpretation of Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation Trial, and bring attention to posaconazole as a potential complementary anti-breast cancer medication. More medications on the US market may have unanticipated off target inhibition of CYP27A1, and we propose strategies for their identification.


Title #1390: Sequential Up-Regulation of SOD2 and HO-1 by Tert-Butylhydroquinone Protects Mitochondria During Oxidative Stress.
PMID: 26082377
Authors: Jiahong J. Sun, Xuefang X. Ren, James W JW. Simpkins
Abstract: Oxidative stress is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative conditions. The transcription factor, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE), regulates intracellular anti-oxidative capacity to combat oxidative stress. We examined the effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway inducer, on mitochondrial function during oxidative challenge in neurons. tBHQ prevented glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in HT-22 neuronal cell line even with an 8 hr exposure delay. tBHQ blocked glutamate-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide accumulation. It also protected mitochondrial function under glutamate toxicity, including maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca2+ hemostasis and mitochondrial respiration. Glutamate activated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was inhibited by tBHQ as well. In rat primary cortical neurons, tBHQ protected cells from both glutamate and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) toxicity. We found that tBHQ scavenged ROS, induced a rapid up-regulation of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression and a delayed up-regulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression. In HT-22 cells with a knockdown of SOD2 expression, delayed treatment of tBHQ failed to prevent glutamate-induced cell death. Briefly, tBHQ rescues mitochondrial function by sequentially increasing SOD2 and HO-1 expression during glutamate-mediated oxidative stress. This study is the first to demonstrate the role of tBHQ in preserving mitochondrial function during oxidative challenge and provides a clinically-relevant argument for using tBHQ against acute neuron-compromising conditions.


Title #1391: Expression of PADI4 in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and its role in mediating the effects of TNF-Î± on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells.
PMID: 26082376
Authors: Yong Y. Yang, Min M. Dai
Abstract: Peptidyl arginine deiminase, typeÂ IVÂ (PADI4) plays an important role in inflammation and in the immune response, and it has been shown to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitisÂ (AS). However, little is known about the precise role of PADI4 in the pathogenic process inÂ vitro. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of PADI4 in the synovial tissue of patients with AS and to determine the potential effects of PADI4 on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) proliferation and osteogenic differentiation under normal and pathological conditions. Synovial tissues were collected from 18Â patients with AS and 11Â control subjects. The results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reactionÂ (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis revealed that the expression of PADI4 was upregulated in the patients withÂ AS. In the hMSCs, the protein expression of PADI4 was increased following treatment with tumor necrosis factor-Î±Â (TNF-Î±) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MTT assay revealed that TNF-Î± promoted hMSC proliferation. In addition, we found that TNF-Î± promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, as demonstrated by an increase in alkaline phosphataseÂ (ALP) activity, as well as an increase in the expression of bone morphogenetic proteinÂ 2Â (BMP-2), runt-related transcription factorÂ 2Â (Runx2) and Osterix. The hMSCs were transfected with PADI4Â siRNA to silence PADI4 expression. We found that, under normal conditions, the silencing of PADI4 did not have any effect on hMSC proliferation or osteogenic differentiation. However, in the presence of TNF-Î±, hMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were induced. These effects were attenuated by the silencing of PADI4. In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that the expression of PADI4 differs between patients with AS and normal subjects. In addition, our data suggest that PADI4 plays a role in hMSC proliferation and differentiation, which are induced by TNF-Î±.

Title #1403: Prognosis of critical limb ischemia: Minor vs major amputation comparison.
PMID: 26082356
Authors: Kyoichi K. Matsuzaki, Ruka R. Hayashi, Keisuke K. Okabe, Noriko N. Aramaki, Kazuo K. Kishi
Abstract: Healthcare providers treating wounds have difficulties assessing the prognoses of patients with critical limb ischemia who had been discharged after complete healing of major amputation wounds. The word "major" in "major amputation" gives the impression of "being more severe" than "minor amputation". Therefore, even if wounds are healed after major amputation, they imagine that prognosis after major amputation would be poorer than that after minor amputation. We investigated the prognosis of diabetic nephropathy patients 2 years after amputations. Those patients underwent dialysis as well as amputation following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for their foot wounds. They were ambulatory prior to these surgeries. Among 56 cases of minor amputation, 45 were males and 11 were females, and mortality was 41.1%. The mortality of cases with and without a coronary intervention history was 53.1% and 25.0%, respectively (p=0.034). Among 10 cases of major amputation, 9 were males and 1 was female, and mortality was 60%. The mortality of cases with and without a coronary intervention history was 75.0% and 0%, respectively. Although we predicted poor prognosis in cases with major amputation, there was no significant difference in mortality 2 years after amputations (p=0.267). Thus far poor prognosis has been reported for major amputation. It might be due to inclusion of the following patients: patients with wounds distal to ankle joints, patients with extensive gangrene spreading to the lower legs, patients with septicemia from wound infection and who died around the time of operation, and patients with malnutrition. The results of our present study showed that the outcomes at 2 years postoperatively were similar between patients with major amputations and those with minor amputations, if surgical wounds were able to heal. We should not estimate the prognosis by the level of amputation, rather we should consider the effect of coronary intervention history on prognosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Title #1404: NELL-1 in the treatment of osteoporotic bone loss.
PMID: 26082355

Abstract: NELL-1 is a secreted, osteoinductive protein whose expression rheostatically controls skeletal ossification. Overexpression of NELL-1 results in craniosynostosis in humans and mice, whereas lack of Nell-1 expression is associated with skeletal undermineralization. Here we show that Nell-1-haploinsufficient mice have normal skeletal development but undergo age-related osteoporosis, characterized by a reduction in osteoblast:osteoclast (OB:OC) ratio and increased bone fragility. Recombinant NELL-1 binds to integrin Î²1 and consequently induces Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling, associated with increased OB differentiation and inhibition of OC-directed bone resorption. Systemic delivery of NELL-1 to mice with gonadectomy-induced osteoporosis results in improved bone mineral density. When extended to a large animal model, local delivery of NELL-1 to osteoporotic sheep spine leads to significant increase in bone formation. Altogether, these findings suggest that NELL-1 deficiency plays a role in osteoporosis and demonstrate the potential utility of NELL-1 as a combination anabolic/antiosteoclastic therapeutic for bone loss.


Title #1405: Immune defence mechanisms of triatomines against bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
PMID: 26082354
Authors: A L AL. Flores-Villegas, P M PM. Salazar-Schettino, A. A. CÃ³rdoba-Aguilar, A E AE. GutiÃ©rrez-Cabrera, G E GE. Rojas-Wastavino, M I MI. Bucio-Torres, M. M. Cabrera-Bravo
Abstract: Triatomines are vectors that transmit the protozoan haemoflagellate Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The aim of the current review is to provide a synthesis of the immune mechanisms of triatomines against bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to provide clues for areas of further research including biological control. Regarding bacteria, the triatomine immune response includes antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as defensins, lysozymes, attacins and cecropins, whose sites of synthesis are principally the fat body and haemocytes. These peptides are used against pathogenic bacteria (especially during ecdysis and feeding), and also attack symbiotic bacteria. In relation to viruses, Triatoma virus is the only one known to attack and kill triatomines. Although the immune response to this virus is unknown, we hypothesize that haemocytes, phenoloxidase (PO) and nitric oxide (NO) could be activated. Different fungal species have been described in a few triatomines and some immune components against these pathogens are PO and proPO. In relation to parasites, triatomines respond with AMPs, including PO, NO and lectin. In the case of T. cruzi this may be effective, but Trypanosoma rangeli seems to evade and suppress PO response. Although it is clear that three parasite-killing processes are used by triatomines - phagocytosis, nodule formation and encapsulation - the precise immune mechanisms of triatomines against invading agents, including trypanosomes, are as yet unknown. The signalling processes used in triatomine immune response are IMD, Toll and Jak-STAT. Based on the information compiled, we propose some lines of research that include strategic approaches of biological control.


Title #1406: Clinical features and correct diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome.
PMID: 26082353
Authors: Randy Q RQ. Cron, Sergio S. Davi, Francesca F. Minoia, Angelo A. Ravelli
Abstract: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is increasingly recognized among febrile hospitalized patients. Clinically, MAS resembles multiorgan dysfunction and shock. Laboratory features include hepatobiliary dysfunction, coagulopathy, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia and markers of immune activation. Pathologically, hemophagocytosis is commonly seen but is only present in 60% of MAS patients. MAS, or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is triggered by infectious (e.g., herpes family viruses), rheumatologic (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and oncologic (e.g., T-cell leukemia) conditions. Formal HLH criteria, while specific, are frequently insensitive for MAS diagnosis. Thus, disease-specific (e.g., SLE) and generic MAS criteria have been published. Recently, novel criteria for MAS in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) were developed and are a key focus of this review.

Title #1408: The association of vitamin C, alcohol, coffee, tea, milk and yogurt with uric acid and gout.
PMID: 26082349
Authors: Patapong P. Towiwat, Zhan-Guo ZG. Li
Abstract: About 2500Â years ago, gout was observed by Hippocrates and many people suffered severe pain and deformity. Lifestyle and diet play a significant role in gout and serum uric acid levels. Epidemiological and research studies have supported this evidence. Many recommendations and guidelines from different parts of the world mention the impact of diet on gout. Recently, new research has shown associations between vitamin C, alcohol, coffee, tea, milk and yogurt with uric acid and the risk of gout. Our review summarizes recently published research regarding dietary impact on the risk of gout and serum uric acid levels.

Title #1414: The effect of MMF dose and trough levels on adverse effects in pediatric heart transplant recipients.
PMID: 26082342
Authors: Nida N. Siddiqi, Jacqueline M JM. Lamour, Daphne T DT. Hsu
Abstract: Limited pharmacokinetic and safety data exist for MMF in pediatric HTR. Previously targeted MPA-TL are 1.5-3.0Â Î¼g/mL. The objective of this study was to assess the outcomes targeting MPA-TL of 0.8-2.0Â Î¼g/mL in pediatric HTR. MPA-TL were retrospectively collected 2-12Â months post-transplant. Acute rejection, infection, leukopenia, and GI complaints were then correlated with MPA-TL. A total of 355 MPA-TL from 22 HTR were included. Median age was 2.5Â yr. Primary indication for transplant was dilated cardiomyopathy (64%). Mean MPA-TL was 1.7Â Â±Â 0.9Â Î¼g/mL. African American patients received significantly higher doses (702Â Â±Â 235Â mg/m(2) ) compared with other races (pÂ =Â 0.035). Leukopenia was less common in patients with SUB MPA vs. others (pÂ =Â 0.01). MMF was discontinued for GI complaints in one patient and leukopenia in two patients. One SUB patient had acute rejection, and one SUP patient had infection. One-yr survival was 100%. Targeting a lower range for MPA-TL was not associated with significant rejection or infection. Despite lower MPA-TL, MMF was discontinued in 3/22 patients for adverse effects.


Title #1415: Free Medicines Thanks to Retirement: Impact of Coinsurance Exemption on Pharmaceutical Expenditures and Hospitalization Offsets in a national health service.
PMID: 26082341
Authors: Jaume J. Puig-Junoy, Pilar P. GarcÃ­a-GÃ³mez, David D. Casado-MarÃ­n
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of coinsurance exemption for prescription medicines applied to elderly individuals in Spain after retirement. We use a rich administrative dataset that links pharmaceutical consumption and hospital discharge records for the full population aged 58 to 65Â years in January 2004 covered by the public insurer in a Spanish region, and we follow them until December 2006. We use a difference-in-differences strategy and exploit the eligibility age for Social Security to control for the endogeneity of the retirement decision. Our results show that this uniform exemption increases the consumption of prescription medicines on average by 17.5%, total pharmaceutical expenditure by 25% and the costs borne by the insurer by 60.4%, without evidence of any offset effect in the form of lower short term probability of hospitalization. The impact is concentrated among consumers of medicines for acute and other non-chronic diseases whose previous coinsurance rate was 30% to 40%. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.


Title #1416: The distribution of whole blood viscosity, its determinants and relationship with arterial blood pressure in the community: cross-sectional analysis from the Gutenberg Health Study.

Abstract: Blood viscosity has a role in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis; changes in this parameter have been associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are (1) involved in the pathophysiology of disease, (2) an epiphenomenon, or (3) the expression of counterregulatory mechanisms. We report data on the normal values of blood viscosity and its association with cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and blood pressure in a large population-based cohort study.


Title #1417: Differential expression of the angiotensin-(1-12)/chymase axis in human atrial tissue.
PMID: 26082339
Authors: Sayaka S. Nagata, Jasmina J. Varagic, Neal D ND. Kon, Hao H. Wang, Leanne L. Groban, Stephen W SW. Simington, Sarfaraz S. Ahmad, Louis J LJ. Dell'Italia, Jessica L JL. VonCannon, Dwight D. Deal, Carlos M CM. Ferrario
Abstract: Heart chymase rather than angiotensin converting enzyme has higher specificity for angiotensin (Ang) I conversion into Ang II in humans. A new pathway for direct cardiac Ang II generation has been revealed through the demonstration that Ang-(1-12) is cleaved by chymase to generate Ang II directly. We address here whether Ang-(1-12) and chymase gene expression and activity are detected in the atrial appendages of 44 patients (10 females) undergoing heart surgery for the correction of valvular heart disease, resistant atrial fibrillation or ischemic heart disease.


Title #1418: Modulation of cardiac L-type Ca2+ current by angiotensin-(1-7): Normal versus heart failure.
PMID: 26082338
Authors: Peng P. Zhou, Che Ping CP. Cheng, Tiankai T. Li, Carlos M CM. Ferrario, Heng-Jie HJ. Cheng
Abstract: Recent evidence has shown that, in heart failure (HF), clinically relevant concentrations of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] counteracts angiotensin II induced cardiac depression and produces positive inotropic effects in both left ventricle (LV) and myocytes. However, the underlying electrophysiological mechanism is unclear. We investigated the role and mechanism of Ang-(1-7) on LV myocyte L-type calcium current (ICa,L) responses in normal state and in HF.

Abstract: ARVD/C and CPVT are rare inheritable sudden cardiac death syndromes predominantly expressed in younger individuals. ARVD/C is characterized by a progressive fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium that predisposes to ventricular tachycardia while CPVT is characterized by exercise induced bidirectional/polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and a structurally normal heart. A mutation in different genes causes these syndromes but recently, mutation in a common gene RYR2 has been associated with both disorders and it has been suggested that CPVT and ARVD/C represent a phenotypic spectrum. We present a case unique in expressing both these phenotypes.

Abstract: Adult sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare subtype of lymphoma. In this retrospective study, we investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) in a cohort of 62 patients. Using LMR <2.6 as the optimal cutoff point, 24 patients (38.7Â %) had LMR <2.6. The complete response rates in high-LMR group and low-LMR group were 90.9 and 65.0Â %, respectively (Pâ=â0.019). At a median follow-up time of 41Â months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rates were 76 and 80Â %, respectively. In a multivariate Cox regression model, it was found that the presence of bone marrow infiltration and low LMR were independently adverse prognostic factors for both PFS and OS. In the whole group, the addition of rituximab to treatment did not benefit patients significantly in PFS and OS. In subgroup analysis, in patients with high LMR, addition of rituximab can significantly improve survival outcomes (Pâ=â0.046). In conclusion, we firstly found that low LMR (<2.60) was an independently adverse prognostic factor in adult patients with sporadic BL. Intensive chemotherapy could cure the majority of patients in our study, and the pretreatment LMR might predict the value of rituximab in this age population.

Abstract: Inhibition of heat shock 90 (Hsp90) molecular chaperones allows targeting of multiple proteins involved in tumorigenesis. We investigated the safety, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of onalespib (AT13387), a potent synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor, administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of 28Â day cycles (QDx2/week) in a phase I trial. This study followed an accelerated titration design with a starting dose of 20Â mg/m(2)/dose and a standard 3â+â3 dose escalation design for dose level 4 (120Â mg/m(2)/dose) and above. Additional patients were enrolled at the RP2D with mandatory paired tumor biopsies to assess modulation of 210 client proteins using reverse phase protein array analysis. Thirty-one patients were treated; RP2D was established at 160Â mg/m(2)/dose on the QDx2/week schedule. Common toxicities were gastrointestinal, hepatic, and hematologic. Pharmacokinetic profile was linear and plasma levels increased proportionally with dose (TÂ½ ~8Â h). No responses were observed; eight patients had stable disease for > 2Â cycles with one patient remaining on study for 6Â cycles. Target engagement was demonstrated by transcriptional upregulation of Hsp70 and Hsp27 in PBMCs. Statistically significant modulation of client proteins was not achieved in the 9 paired tumor biopsies evaluated; however, hierarchical clustering revealed two subgroups of patients with differential patterns of protein expression. Further combination studies are needed in order to target prospective driver oncoproteins.


Title #1424: Activated protein C upregulates ovarian cancer cell migration and promotes unclottability of the cancer cell microenvironment.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of activated protein C (aPC), known to be a physiological anticoagulant, in ovarian cancer cell activation as well as in loss of clotting of cancer ascitic fluid. The effect of aPC on an ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR-3) was tested in regards to i)Â cell migration and adhesion with the use of adhesion and wound healing assays as well as a droplet test; ii) protein phosphorylation, evaluated by cyto-ELISA; iii) cell cycle modification assessed by flow cytometric DNA quantification; and iv)Â anticoagulant activity evaluated by the prolongation of partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of normal plasma in the presence or absence of aPCâtreated ovarian cancer cells. In addition, the soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR) was quantified by ELISA in ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian cancer. Our results showed that in the OVCAR-3 aPC-induced cells i)Â an increase in cell migration was noted, which was inhibited when anti-endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was added to the culture medium and which may act via MEK-ERK and Rho-GTPase pathways; ii)Â an increase in threonine, and to a lesser extent tyrosine phosphorylation; iii) cell cycle activation (G1 to S/G2); and iv)Â a 2-3-fold prolongation of aPTT of normal plasma. In the peritoneal fluid, the sEPCR concentration was 71Â±23Â ng/ml. In conclusion, free aPC binds to membrane EPCR in ovarian cancer cells and induces cell migration via MEK-ERK and Rho-GTPase pathways. This binding could also explain the loss of clotting of peritoneal fluids.


Title #1425: Nicotine absorption from electronic cigarette use: comparison between experienced consumers (vapers) and naÃ¯ve users (smokers).

Abstract: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are nicotine delivery devices that are proposed as tobacco harm reduction products to smokers. Nicotine delivery from ECs is potentially important in their efficacy as smoking substitutes. Herein, nicotine delivery from using a new-generation EC device (variable-wattage, set at 9âW) was evaluated, comparing experienced (vapers) with naÃ¯ve users (smokers). Twenty-four vapers and 23 smokers participated to the study. They were asked to obtain 10 puffs in 5âminutes and then use the EC ad lib for 60 more minutes (total duration of use: 65âminutes). An 18âmg/mL nicotine-containing liquid was used. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, 5-minutes and every 15âminutes thereafter, while number of puffs and average puff duration were recorded. Although at baseline both groups had similar plasma nicotine levels, smokers consistently exhibited lower levels at all time-periods; at 5-minutes the levels were lower by 46%, while during the subsequent period they were lower by 43% (at 65-minutes) to 54% (at 20-minutes). Both groups took similar number of puffs, but smokers had average puff duration of 2.3âs compared to 3.5âs in vapers. Even in vapers, plasma nicotine levels at 5âminutes were lower than those observed after smoking 1 tobacco cigarette.


Title #1426: Ionic-liquid-impregnated resin for the microwave-assisted solid-liquid extraction of triazine herbicides in honey.
PMID: 26082329

Abstract: Microwave-assisted ionic-liquid-impregnated resin solid-liquid extraction was developed for the extraction of triazine herbicides, including cyanazine, metribuzin, desmetryn, secbumeton, terbumeton, terbuthylazine, dimethametryn, and dipropetryn in honey samples. The ionic-liquid-impregnated resin was prepared by immobilizing 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate in the microspores of resin. The resin was used as the extraction adsorbent. The extraction and enrichment of analytes were performed in a single step. The extraction time can be shortened greatly with the help of microwave. The effects of experimental parameters including type of resin, type of ionic liquid, mass ratio of resin to ionic liquid, extraction time, amount of the impregnated resin, extraction temperature, salt concentration, and desorption conditions on the extraction efficiency, were investigated. A Box-Behnken design was applied to the selection of the experimental parameters. The recoveries were in the range of 80.1 to 103.4% and the relative standard deviations were lower than 6.8%. The present method was applied to the analysis of honey samples. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.


Title #1427: A novel method of continuous cage-side monitoring of hyperthyroid cats treated with radio-iodine.
PMID: 26082328
Authors: E. E. Roberts, J M JM. Gray, E. E. Gunn, I K IK. Ramsey
Abstract: A continuous monitoring system (MGP DM2000X) was assessed for monitoring Î³ radiation emissions and determining appropriate isolation times for hyperthyroid cats treated with radioactive iodine (I(131)). Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200âMBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54âdays (range 1.40-3.24âdays). Cats treated with 200âMBq emitted 5âÂµGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100âÂµGy (range 0-43âÂµGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17âdays as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure Î³ radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.


Title #1428: GM2-Gangliosidosis, AB Variant: Clinical, Ophthalmological, MRI, and Molecular Findings.
PMID: 26082327
Authors: Deborah D. Renaud, Michael M. Brodsky
Abstract: GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is a very rare form of GM2 gangliosidosis due to a deficiency of GM2 activator protein, associated with autosomal recessive mutations in GM2A. Less than ten patients, confirmed by molecular analysis, have been described in the literature.A 12-month-old Hmong girl presented to the neurometabolic clinic for evaluation of global developmental delay, hypotonia, and cherry red spots. The parents were not known to be consanguineous. Her examination was remarkable for hypotonia with hyperreflexia and excessive startling. The head circumference was normal. An extensive neurometabolic evaluation was negative.Developmental regression began at 14 months of age. Retinal examination at 16 months of age disclosed 4+ cherry red/black spots with "heaped up" ring of whitish infiltrate surrounding both foveae but no evidence of optic atrophy or peripheral retinal abnormalities. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 17 months of age revealed delayed but interval myelination associated with abnormal signal intensity of the bilateral thalami presenting as T2 hyperintensity of the posterior thalami in the region of the pulvinar nuclei and T2 hypointensity in the anterior thalami. Sequencing of the GM2A gene revealed a homozygous c.160 G>T mutation, predicted to result in a premature protein termination p. Glu54*.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of outcome and prognostic factors for survival after liver metastasectomy for GC.


Title #1430: Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw goat milk and effect of farming practices on the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria.
PMID: 26082325
Authors: HÃ©lÃ¨ne H. Tormo, Djamila D. Ali Haimoud Lekhal, C. C. Roques
Abstract: Lactic acid bacteria, in particular Lactococcuslactis, play a decisive role in the cheese making process and more particularly in lactic cheeses which are primarily produced on goat dairy farms. The objective of this study was therefore to identify the main lactic acid bacteria found in raw goats' milk from three different regions in France and evaluate if certain farming practices have an effect on the distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria in the various milk samples. Identification at genus or species level was carried out using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods including repetitive element REP-PCR, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The distribution of the main bacterial species in the milk samples varied depending on farms and their characteristics. Out of the 146 strains identified, L. lactis was the dominant species (60% of strains), followed by Enterococcus (38%) of which Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Within the species L. lactis, L. lactis subsp lactis was detected more frequently than L. lactis subsp cremoris (74% vs. 26%). The predominance of L. lactis subsp cremoris was linked to geographical area studied. It appears that the animals' environment plays a role in the balance between the dominance of L. lactis and enterococci in raw goats' milk. The separation between the milking parlor and the goat shed (vs no separation) and only straw in the bedding (vs straw and hay) seems to promote L. lactis in the milk (vs enterococci).


Title #1431: Antimicrobial activity of thyme oil co-nanoemulsified with sodium caseinate and lecithin.
PMID: 26082324
Authors: Jia J. Xue, P. P. Michael Davidson, Qixin Q. Zhong
Abstract: Emulsions of essential oils are investigated as potential intervention strategies to improve food safety and are preferably prepared from generally-recognized-as-safe emulsifiers. Stable thyme oil nanoemulsions can be prepared using combinations of sodium caseinate (NaCas) and soy lecithin. The objective of the present research was to study the antimicrobial activity of these nanoemulsions and understand the impacts of emulsifier concentrations. 10g/L thyme oil was emulsified using combinations of (A) 4% w/v NaCas and 0.5% w/v lecithin or (B) 2% w/v NaCas and 0.25% w/v lecithin by high shear homogenization. Combination A resulted in a transparent emulsion with a mean droplet diameter of 82.5nm, while it was turbid for the Combination B with an average diameter of 125.5nm. Nanoemulsified thyme oil exhibited quicker initial reductions of bacteria than free thyme oil in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and 2% reduced fat milk at 21Â°C, due to the improved dispersibility of thyme oil. In TSB with 0.3g/L thyme oil, it took less than 4 and 8h for two nanoemulsions and free oil, respectively, to reduce Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes to be below the detection limit. The emulsified thyme oil also demonstrated more significant reductions of bacteria initially (4 and 8h) in 2% reduced fat milk than free thyme oil. Especially, with 4g/L thyme oil, the nanoemulsion prepared with Combination A reduced L. monocytogenes to be below the detection limit after 72h, while the free thyme oil treatment was only bacteriostatic and the turbid nanoemulsion treatment with Combination B resulted in about 1logCFU/mL reduction. However, E. coli O157:H7 treated with 3g/L emulsified thyme oil and Salmonella Enteritidis treated with 4g/L emulsified thyme oil recovered to a higher extent in milk than free thyme oil treatments. The increased concentration of emulsifiers in Combination A apparently reduced the antimicrobials available to alter bacteria membrane permeability as tested by the crystal violet assay at low antimicrobial concentrations and short time (1h). The findings suggest that nanoemulsions can be potentially used to incorporate thyme oil for use as antimicrobial preservatives in foods.


Title #1432: Towards an Understanding of Molecule Capture by the Antennae of Male Beetles Belonging to the Genus Rhipicera (Coleoptera, Rhipiceridae).
PMID: 26082323
Authors: Andrew A. Ramsey, Terry F TF. Houston, Alexander D AD. Ball, Tomasz T. Goral, Maxwell V L MV. Barclay, Jonathan P L JP. Cox
Abstract: Working on the hypothesis that an important function of the lamellate antennae of adult male beetles belonging to the genus Rhipicera is to detect scent associated with female conspecifics, and using field observations, anatomical models derived from X-ray microcomputed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy, we have investigated the behavioural, morphological, and morphometric factors that may influence molecule capture by these antennae. We found that male beetles fly upwind in a zigzag manner, or face upwind when perching, behaviour consistent with an animal that is tracking scent. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of the male and female antennae, like their gross morphology, is sexually dimorphic, with male antennae possessing many more of a particular type of receptor - the sensillum placodeum - than their female counterparts (approximately 30,000 v. 100 per antenna, respectively). Based on this disparity, we assume that the sensilla placodea on the male antennae are responsible for detecting scent associated with female Rhipicera beetles. Molecule capture by male antennae in their alert, fanned states is likely to be favoured by: a) male beetles adopting prominent, upright positions on high points when searching for scent; b) the partitioning of antennae into many small segments; c) antennal morphometry (height, width, outline area, total surface area, leakiness, and narrow channels); d) the location of the sensilla placodea where they are most likely to encounter odorant molecules; and e) well dispersed sensilla placodea. The molecule-capturing ability of male Rhipicera antennae may be similar to that of the pectinate antennae of certain male moths. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.


Title #1433: Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Heart Transplantation Across a Positive Crossmatch for High Waitlist Urgency Candidates.
PMID: 26082322

Abstract: Allosensitized children listed with a requirement for a negative prospective crossmatch have high mortality. Previously, we found that listing with the intent to accept the first suitable organ offer, regardless of the possibility of a positive crossmatch (TAKE strategy), results in a survival advantage from the time of listing compared to awaiting transplantation across a negative crossmatch (WAIT). The cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. We used Markov modeling to compare cost-effectiveness between these waitlist strategies for allosensitized children listed urgently for heart transplantation. We used registry data to estimate costs and waitlist/posttransplant outcomes. We assumed patients remained in hospital after listing, no positive crossmatches for WAIT, and a base-case probability of a positive crossmatch of 47% for TAKE. Accepting the first suitable organ offer cost less ($405â904 vs. $534â035) and gained more quality-adjusted life years (3.71 vs. 2.79). In sensitivity analyses, including substitution of waitlist data from children with unacceptable antigens specified during listing, TAKE remained cost-saving or cost-effective. Our findings suggest acceptance of the first suitable organ offer for urgently listed allosensitized pediatric heart transplant candidates is cost-effective and transplantation should not be denied because of allosensitization status alone.

Title #1436: Comprehensive phenotypic analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) response to salinity stress.
PMID: 26082319
Authors: InÃªs S IS. Pires, SÃ³nia S. NegrÃ£o, M Margarida MM. Oliveira, Michael D MD. Purugganan
Abstract: Increase in soil salinity levels is becoming a major cause of crop yield losses worldwide. Rice (Oryza sativa) is the most salt-sensitive cereal crop, and many studies have focused on rice salinity tolerance, but a global understanding of this crop's response to salinity is still lacking. We systematically analyzed phenotypic data previously collected for 56 rice genotypes to assess the extent to which rice uses three known salinity tolerance mechanisms: shoot-ion independent tolerance (or osmotic tolerance), ion exclusion, and tissue tolerance. In general, our analyses of different phenotypic traits agree with results of previous rice salinity tolerance studies. However, we also established that the three salinity tolerance mechanisms mentioned earlier appear among rice genotypes and that none of them is predominant. Against the pervasive view in the literature that K(+) /Na(+) ratio is the most important trait in salinity tolerance, we found that K(+) concentration was not significantly affected by salt stress in rice, which puts in question the importance of K(+) /Na(+) when analyzing rice salt stress response. Not only do our results contribute to improve our global understanding of salt stress response in an important crop, but we also use our results together with an extensive literature research to highlight some issues commonly observed in salinity stress tolerance studies and to propose solutions for future experiments.

Abstract: Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders caused by defects in genes encoding for proteins involved in the lysosomal degradation of macromolecules. They occur at a frequency of about 1 in 5,000 live births, though recent neonatal screening suggests a higher incidence. New treatment options for LSDs demand a rapid, early diagnosis of LSDs if maximal clinical benefit is to be achieved.


Title #1438: 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase is upregulated by hydroxychloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
PMID: 26082314

Abstract: 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) is the key enzyme responsible for the metabolic inactivation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) catabolism. PGE2 is one of the predominant catabolic factors involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the expression and regulation of HPGD in RA fibroblastâlike synoviocyte (FLS) remain to be elucidated. Diseaseâmodifying antiârheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the most important antiâarthritic drugs, which reduce the effect of joint injury. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression of HPGD in RA tissues and cells, and normal synovial tissues and cells. The effect of the most popular DMARDs, hydroxychloroquine, on the expression of HPGD in RAâFLS was also investigated. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of HPGD in human synovium were lower in RA synovium compared with the normal and OA synovium. In RAâFLS, the expression of HPGD was increased following treatment with several DMARDs, including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine (10Â ÂµM) treatment induced the phosphorylation of ERK, SAPK/JNK and p38. Hydroxychloroquine induced a decrease in the release of PGE2, which was restored by mitogenâactivated protein (MAP) kinase pathway inhibitors. Hydroxychloroquine may therefore, affect the pathogenesis of RA through the MAP kinase pathway by regulating the expression of HPGD.


Title #1439: Immune and inflammatory responses of Australian firefighters after repeated exposures to the heat.
PMID: 26082313
Authors: Anthony A. Walker, Toby T. Keene, Christos C. Argus, Matthew M. Driller, Joshua H JH. Guy, Ben B. Rattray
Abstract: When firefighters work in hot conditions, altered immune and inflammatory responses may increase the risk of a cardiac event. The present study aimed to establish the time course of such responses. Forty-two urban firefighters completed a repeat work protocol in a heat chamber (100Â Â±Â 5Â°C). Changes to leukocytes, platelets, TNFÎ±, IL-6, IL-10, LPS and CRP were evaluated immediately post-work and also after 1 and 24Â h of rest. Increases in core temperatures were associated with significant increases in leukocytes, platelets and TNFÎ± directly following work. Further, platelets continued to increase at 1Â h (+31.2Â Â±Â 31.3Â ÃÂ 10(9)Â l, pÂ <Â 0.01) and remained elevated at 24Â h (+15.9Â Â±Â 19.6Â ÃÂ 10(9)Â l, pÂ <Â 0.01). Sustained increases in leukocytes and platelets may increase the risk of cardiac events in firefighters when performing repeat work tasks in the heat. This is particularly relevant during multi-day deployments following natural disasters. Practitioner Summary: Firefighters regularly re-enter fire affected buildings or are redeployed to further operational tasks. Should work in the heat lead to sustained immune and inflammatory changes following extended rest periods, incident controllers should plan appropriate work/rest cycles to minimise these changes and any subsequent risks of cardiac events.


Title #1440: Dynamics of a Class of HIV Infection Models with Cure of Infected Cells in Eclipse Stage.
PMID: 26082312
Authors: Mehdi M. Maziane, El Mehdi EM. Lotfi, Khalid K. Hattaf, Noura N. Yousfi
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two HIV infection models with specific nonlinear incidence rate by including a class of infected cells in the eclipse phase. The first model is described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and generalizes a set of previously existing models and their results. The second model extends our ODE model by taking into account the diffusion of virus. Furthermore, the global stability of both models is investigated by constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals. Finally, we check our theoretical results with numerical simulations.

Title #1442: Impairment of hypoxia-induced HIF-1Î± signaling in keratinocytes and fibroblasts by sulfur mustard is counteracted by a selective PHD-2 inhibitor.
PMID: 26082309

Abstract: Skin exposure to sulfur mustard (SM) provokes long-term complications in wound healing. Similar to chronic wounds, SM-induced skin lesions are associated with low levels of oxygen in the wound tissue. Normally, skin cells respond to hypoxia by stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1Î±). HIF-1Î± modulates expression of genes including VEGFA, BNIP3, and MMP2 that control processes such as angiogenesis, growth, and extracellular proteolysis essential for proper wound healing. The results of our studies revealed that exposure of primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) to SM significantly impaired hypoxia-induced HIF-1Î± stabilization and target gene expression in these cells. Addition of a selective inhibitor of the oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD-2), IOX2, fully recovered HIF-1Î± stability, nuclear translocation, and target gene expression in NHEK and NHDF. Moreover, functional studies using a scratch wound assay demonstrated that the application of IOX2 efficiently counteracted SM-mediated deficiencies in monolayer regeneration under hypoxic conditions in NHEK and NHDF. Our findings describe a pathomechanism by which SM negatively affects hypoxia-stimulated HIF-1Î± signaling in keratinocytes and fibroblasts and thus possibly contributes to delayed wound healing in SM-injured patients that could be treated with PHD-2 inhibitors.


Title #1443: Human metabolism and renal excretion of selenium compounds after oral ingestion of sodium selenite and selenized yeast dependent on the trimethylselenium ion (TMSe) status.
PMID: 26082308
Authors: Thomas T. JÃ¤ger, Hans H. Drexler, Thomas T. GÃ¶en
Abstract: A human in vivo metabolism study was carried out to investigate the impact of the trimethylselenium ion (TMSe) status on metabolism and toxicokinetics of sodium selenite and selenized yeast. Nine healthy human volunteers were orally exposed to 200Â Âµg selenium as sodium selenite and seven with selenized yeast (100Â Âµg selenium). In each intervention group, three subjects belong to TMSe eliminators. Blood samples were withdrawn before and up to 6Â h after administration. Urine samples were collected before and within 24Â h after administration. Total selenium (Se) was quantified in blood plasma and urine and low molecular Se species in urine. Selenium concentration in plasma increased from 84.5Â Â±Â 13.2Â Âµg Se/L before to 97.4Â Â±Â 13.2Â Âµg Se/L 2-3Â h after selenite supplementation and 89.5Â Â±Â 12.9Â Âµg Se/L to 92.1Â Â±Â 13.9Â Âµg Se/L after selenized yeast intake. The oral ingestion caused an additional Se elimination via urine of 16.9Â Â±Â 10.6Â Âµg/24Â h (TMSe elim.: 10.8Â Â±Â 6.9Â Âµg/24Â h; non-TMSe elim.: 20.0Â Â±Â 11.3Â Âµg Se/24Â h) after selenite exposure and 11.8Â Â±Â 4.1Â Âµg/24Â h (TMSe elim.: 10.8Â Â±Â 4.6Â Âµg/24Â h; non-TMSe elim.: 12.6Â Â±Â 4.2Â Âµg Se/24Â h) after selenized yeast exposure. Methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-Î²-D-galactopyranoside (SeSug1) was the main metabolite in all urine samples, whereas TMSe was another main metabolite in TMSe eliminators' urine. After selenite exposure, a small amount of the dose (0.5Â Â±Â 0.2Â %) was oxidized to selenate and rapidly excreted via urine. With the exception of selenite exposure in TMSe eliminators, the comparison of total Se and the sum of quantified Se species revealed a high renal portion of unidentified species. The study indicated a different metabolism of inorganic and organic Se compounds in human, but also crucial differences of Se metabolism in TMSe eliminators and non-TMSe eliminators.


Title #1444: Mitochondrial permeability transition and its regulatory components are implicated in apoptosis of primary cultures of rat proximal tubular cells exposed to lead.
PMID: 26082307

Abstract: Previous studies have already demonstrated that mitochondria play a key role in Pb-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat proximal tubular (rPT) cells. To further clarify the underlying mechanism of Pb-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, this study was designed to investigate the role of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and its regulatory components in Pb-induced apoptosis in rPT cells. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening together with disruption of mitochondrial ultrastructure, translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm and subsequent caspase-3 activation were observed in this study, suggesting that MPT is involved in Pb-induced apoptosis in rPT cells. Simultaneously, Pb-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis can be significantly inhibited by three MPTP inhibitors (CsA, DIDS, BA), which target different regulatory components of MPTP (Cyp-D, VDAC, ANT), respectively, demonstrating that Cyp-D, VDAC and ANT participate in MPTP regulation during lead exposure. Moreover, decreased ATP levels and increased ADP/ATP ratio induced by lead treatment can be significantly reversed by BA, indicating that Pb-mediated ANT dysfunction resulted in ATP depletion. In addition, up-regulation of VDAC-1, ANT-1 together with down-regulation of Cyp-D, VDAC-2 and ANT-2 at both the levels of transcription and translation were revealed in rPT cells under lead exposure conditions. In conclusion, Pb-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in rPT cells is dependent on MPTP opening. Different expression levels in each isoform of three regulatory components contribute to alteration in their functions, which may promote the MPTP opening.


Title #1445: Failure of Fixation Suppression of Spontaneous Nystagmus in Cerebellar Infarction: Frequency, Pattern, and a Possible Structure.
PMID: 26082303
Authors: Hyun-Ah HA. Kim, Hyon-Ah HA. Yi, Hyung H. Lee
Abstract: To investigate the frequency and pattern of failure of the fixation suppression (FFS) of spontaneous nystagmus (SN) in unilateral cerebellar infarction, and to identify the structure responsible for FFS, 29 patients with acute, mainly unilateral, isolated cerebellar infarction who had SN with a predominantly horizontal component were enrolled in this study. The ocular fixation index (OFI) was defined as the mean slow phase velocity (SPV) of the horizontal component of SN with fixation divided by the mean SPV of the horizontal component of SN without fixation. The OFI from age- and sex-matched patients with vestibular neuritis was calculated and used as the control data. The FFS of SN was only found in less than half (41Â %, 12/29) of the patients. Approximately 65Â % (nâ=â7) of the patients with isolated anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory cerebellar infarction showed FFS, whereas only a quarter (nâ=â3) of the patients with isolated posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory cerebellar infarction showed FFS. The proportion of gaze-evoked nystagmus (6/12 [50Â %] vs. 2/17 [12Â %], pâ=â0.04) and deficient gain of ipsilesional pursuit (10/12 [83Â %] vs. 6/17 [35Â %], pâ=â0.05) was more frequent in the FFS group than in the group without FFS. Lesion subtraction analysis in isolated PICA territory cerebellar infarction revealed that the nodulus was commonly damaged in patients with FFS, compared to that of patients without FFS. Our study shows that FFS of SN due to acute cerebellar infarction is less common than previously thought and the nodulus may be an important structure for the suppression of SN in humans.


Title #1446: Classification in two-stage screening.
PMID: 26082302
Authors: Nicholas T NT. Longford
Abstract: Decision theory is applied to the problem of setting thresholds in medical screening when it is organised in two stages. In the first stage that involves a less expensive procedure that can be applied on a mass scale, an individual is classified as a negative or a likely positive. In the second stage, the likely positives are subjected to another test that classifies them as (definite) positives or negatives. The second-stage test is more accurate, but also more expensive and more involved, and so there are incentives to restrict its application. Robustness of the method with respect to the parameters, some of which have to be set by elicitation, is assessed by sensitivity analysis. Copyright Â© 2015âJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.


Title #1447: The expression of high-mobility group box protein-1 in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis with disc perforation.
PMID: 26082301
Authors: Yaping Y. Feng, Wei W. Fang, Cheng C. Li, Huilin H. Guo, Yingjie Y. Li, Xing X. Long
Abstract: High-mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1), a potent promoter of inflammation, was believed to be a potential trigger of osteoarthritis (OA). Only a few studies have investigated the role of HMGB-1 in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) OA, especially in disc perforation cases. But in this study, not only the expression of HMGB-1 in TMJ OA with disc perforation was investigated but also the possible role of HMGB-1 in TMJ OA was discussed.


Title #1448: Equation of motion and general solution for the one-dimensional complex cell response in the signal-tuned approach.
PMID: 26082300
Authors: JosÃ© R A JR. TorreÃ£o
Abstract: A signal-tuned approach has been recently introduced for modeling stimulus-dependent cortical receptive fields. The approach is based on signal-tuned Gabor functions, which are Gaussian-modulated sinusoids whose parameters are obtained from a "tuning" signal. Given a stimulus to a cell, it is taken as the tuning signal for the Gabor function modeling the cell's receptive field, and the inner product of the stimulus and the stimulus-dependent field produces the cell's response. Here, we derive and solve the equation of motion for the signal-tuned complex cell response [Formula: see text], where x and [Formula: see text] are receptive-field parameters: its center, and the delay with which it adapts to a change in input. The motion equation can be mapped onto the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for a system with time-dependent imaginary mass and time-dependent complex potential, and yields a plane-wave solution and an Airy-packet solution. The plane-wave solution replicates responses previously obtained for temporally modulated and translating signals, and yields responses which seem compatible with apparent-motion effects, when the stimulus is a pair of alternating pulses. The Airy-packet solution can lead to long-range propagating responses.

Title #1450: High levels of alcohol consumption in pregnant women from a touristic area of Southern Spain.
PMID: 26082298

Abstract: The prevalence of alcohol intake in women who become pregnant is similar to that found in the general population, especially in cases of unplanned pregnancies. Consequently, foetal exposure is high during the period of maximum vulnerability. The present study was carried out to determine the prenatal level of exposure to alcohol in MÃ¡laga, a Mediterranean region whose economy is based on the touristic sector (Costa del Sol). A cross-sectional, observational design was used to investigate the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, based on a self-reporting questionnaire. A total of 451 women in the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy were recruited. Consumption prevalences in each trimester were 40.7%, 25.5% and 17.1%. A higher educational level was associated with greater exposure to alcohol (risk ratio, 1.87 [1.30-2.69]). These results should alert the providers of obstetric care in touristic areas to the need for the adoption of adequate preventive measures.


Title #1451: Percentage change in body mass index or gestational weight gain: Which is a better predictor of foetal macrosomia?
PMID: 26082297
Authors: I. I. Kahyaoglu, T. T. KÄ±nay, F. F. KayÄ±kcÄ±oglu, S. S. Kahyaoglu, L. L. Mollamahmutoglu
Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate gestational weight gain (GWG) and percentage change in body mass index (BMI) for prediction of foetal macrosomia. A total of 409 term pregnant women, of whom 86 delivered macrosomic infants (> 4000 g) and 323 delivered non-macrosomic infants were recruited for the study. GWG and body mass index at delivery were significantly higher in the macrosomic than non-macrosomic group (15.8 Â± 5.6 vs 13.9 Â± 5.6, and 31.4 Â± 4.3 vs 29.5 Â± 4.3, respectively) (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for testing the significance of weight gain in prediction of macrosomia showed an area under curve of 0.58 (p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52-0.65), and significance of percentage change in BMI in prediction of macrosomia revealed an area under curve of 0.52 (p = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.46-0.59). BMI percentage changes both in obese (BMI â¥ 25) and non-obese (BMI < 25) groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). BMI percentage change does not seem to be a strong predictor of foetal macrosomia, and GWG was not found to be an independent risk factor after multivariate regression analysis was performed.


Title #1452: Is the 2003 ISSVD terminology and classification of vulvodynia up-to-date? A neurobiological perspective.
PMID: 26082295
Authors: L. L. Micheletti, G. G. Radici, P J PJ. Lynch
Abstract: This paper aims to determine if the 2003 International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) terminology and classification of vulval pain is up-to-date, according to a current and widely accepted neurobiological pain classification, which divides pain into nociceptive, inflammatory and pathological pain with the latter subdivided into neuropathic and dysfunctional pain. Nociceptive pain is protective, adaptive, high-threshold pain provoked by noxious stimuli. Inflammatory pain is protective, adaptive, low-threshold pain associated with peripheral tissue damage and inflammation. Pathological pain is non-protective, maladaptive, low-threshold pain caused by structural damage to the nervous system (neuropathic pain) or by its abnormal function (dysfunctional pain). The 2003 ISSVD vulval pain classification should be revised in terms of current neurobiological pain information. Inflammatory vulval pain occurs as a result of specific infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Neuropathic vulval pain arises following a specific neurological disorder, responsible for structural damage to the nervous system. Vulvodynia is dysfunctional vulval pain, caused by abnormal function of the nervous system itself.


Title #1453: Evolution of dispersal in spatially and temporally variable environments: the importance of life cycles.
PMID: 26082294
Authors: FranÃ§ois F. Massol, Florence F. DÃ©barre
Abstract: Spatio-temporal variability of the environment is bound to affect the evolution of dispersal, and yet model predictions strongly differ on this particular effect. Recent studies on the evolution of local adaptation have shown that the life cycle chosen to model the selective effects of spatio-temporal variability of the environment is a critical factor determining evolutionary outcomes. Here, we investigate the effect of the orderof events in the life cycle onthe evolution of unconditional dispersal in a spatially heterogeneous, temporally varying landscape. Our results show that the occurrence of intermediate singular strategies and disruptive selection are conditioned by the temporal autocorrelation of the environment and by the life cycle. Life cycles with dispersal of adults versus dispersal of juveniles, local versus global density regulation, give radically different evolutionary outcomes that include selection for total philopatry, evolutionary bistability, selection for intermediate stable states and evolutionary branching points. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for life cycle specifics when predicting the effects of the environment on evolutionarily selected trait values, such as dispersal, as well as the need to check the robustness of model conclusions against modifications of the life cycle.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Elevated intracranial pressure is one of the most common problems in patients with diverse intracranial disorders, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Effective management for increased intracranial pressure is based mainly on surgical and medical techniques with hyperosmolar therapy as one of the core medical treatments. The study aimed to explore the effects of continuous micro-pump infusions of 3% hypertonic saline combined with furosemide on intracranial pressure control. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data on 56 eligible participants with intracranial pressure >20 mmHg from March 2013 to July 2014. The target was to increase and maintain plasma sodium to a level between 145 and 155 mmol/L and osmolarity to a level of 310 to 320 mOsmol/kg. RESULTS Plasma sodium levels significantly increased from 138Â±5 mmol/L at admission to 151Â±3 mmol/L at 24 h (P<0.01). Osmolarity increased from 282Â±11 mOsmol/kg at baseline to 311Â±8 mOsmol/kg at 24 h (P<0.01). Intracranial pressure significantly decreased from 32Â±7 mmHg to 15Â±6 mmHg at 24 h (P<0.01). There was a significant improvement in CPP (P<0.01). Moreover, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale slightly increased. However, these changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline + furosemide is effective and safe for intracranial pressure control.


Title #1455: Quantification of EBV DNA load in nasopharyngeal brushing samples in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in southern china.
PMID: 26082292
Authors: Xiao-Hui XH. Zheng, Li-Xia LX. Lu, Xi-Zhao XZ. Li, Wei-Hua WH. Jia
Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly incident in southern China, contributing 40% of world's new cases every year. Detecting EBV DNA load in nasopharyngeal (NP) brush/swab samples has attracted great attentions in recent years. However, its applicable value in NPC diagnosis has never been investigated in our area. It is necessary and meaningful to explore whether such test can be applicable to our local population. A total of 245 consecutive participants undergoing NP brushing examination were recruited to obtain the NP brushing samples in this study. Quantitative PCR assays were used to obtain the EBV DNA load. Mann-Whitney, ANOVA and ROC test were used to analyze its diagnostic value. NP brushing samples from NPC patients showed extremely high levels of EBV DNA load (mean = 46360 copy/ng DNA) than its expression from non-NPC control (mean = 28 copy/ng DNA) and high risk control (mean = 50 copy/ng DNA). It produced 96% sensitivity and 97% specificity, at the COV = 225 copy/ng DNA. Further, EBV DNA load could reflect disease progress. Our data showed a better performance of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples compared with an initial biopsy, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titers to viral capsid antigen (VCA) in serum and EBV DNA load in plasma. Detection of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples could be used as an effective supplement for NPC's diagnosis. Due to its less invasion and low cost, NP brush sampling combined with EBV DNA detection exhibits great potential for further screening high-risk populations. This article is protected by copyright.

Title #1456: Gas hydrate inhibition by perturbation of liquid water structure.
PMID: 26082291

Abstract: Natural gas hydrates are icy crystalline materials that contain hydrocarbons, which are the primary energy source for this civilization. The abundance of naturally occurring gas hydrates leads to a growing interest in exploitation. Despite their potential as energy resources and in industrial applications, there is insufficient understanding of hydrate kinetics, which hinders the utilization of these invaluable resources. Perturbation of liquid water structure by solutes has been proposed to be a key process in hydrate inhibition, but this hypothesis remains unproven. Here, we report the direct observation of the perturbation of the liquid water structure induced by amino acids using polarized Raman spectroscopy, and its influence on gas hydrate nucleation and growth kinetics. Amino acids with hydrophilic and/or electrically charged side chains disrupted the water structure and thus provided effective hydrate inhibition. The strong correlation between the extent of perturbation by amino acids and their inhibition performance constitutes convincing evidence for the perturbation inhibition mechanism. The present findings bring the practical applications of gas hydrates significantly closer, and provide a new perspective on the freezing and melting phenomena of naturally occurring gas hydrates.


Title #1457: Recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells by stromal cell-derived factorÂ 1Î± in pulp cells from deciduous teeth.
PMID: 26082290

Abstract: Dental pulp cells (DPCs), including dental pulpÂ (DP) stem cells, play a role in dentine repair under certain conditions caused by bacterial infections associated with caries, tooth fracture and injury. Mesenchymal stem cellsÂ (MSCs) have also been shown to be involved in this process of repair. However, the mechanisms through which MSCs are recruited to the DP have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of the present inÂ vitro study was to investigate whether stromal cellâderived factorÂ 1Î±Â (SDF1)-C-X-C chemokine receptor typeÂ 4 (CXCR4) signaling is involved in tissue repair in the DP of deciduous teeth. A single-cell clone from DPCs (SDP11) and UE7T-13 cells were used as pulp cells and MSCs, respectively. The MG-63 and HuO9 cells, two osteosarcoma cell lines, were used as positive control cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionÂ (RTâPCR) revealed that all cell lines (SDP11, UE7T-13 MG-63 and HuO9) were positive for both SDF1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression. Moreover, immunocytochemical analysis indicated that SDF1 and CXCR4 proteins were expressed in the SDP11 and UE7T-13 cells. SDF1 was also detected in the cell lysatesÂ (CLs) and conditioned mediumÂ (CM) collected from the SDP11 and UE7T-13 cells, and AMD3100, a specific antagonist of CXCR4, inhibited the migration of the UE7T-13 cells; this migration was induced by treatment with CM, which was collected from the SDP11 cells. In addition, real-time PCR showed that the expression of SDF1 in the SDP11 cells was inhibited by treatment with 20Â ng/ml fibroblast growth factorÂ (FGF)-2, and exposure to AZD4547, an inhibitor of the FGF receptor, blocked this inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that SDF1 produced by DP plays an important role in homeostasis, repair and regeneration via the recruitment of MSCs.

Abstract: From October 2013 through February 2014, human parechovirus genotype 3 infection was identified in 183 infants in New South Wales, Australia. Of those infants, 57% were male and 95% required hospitalization. Common signs and symptoms were fever >38Â°C (86%), irritability (80%), tachycardia (68%), and rash (62%). Compared with affected infants in the Northern Hemisphere, infants in New South Wales were slightly older, both sexes were affected more equally, and rash occurred with considerably higher frequency. The New South Wales syndromic surveillance system, which uses near real-time emergency department and ambulance data, was useful for monitoring the outbreak. An alert distributed to clinicians reduced unnecessary hospitalization for patients with suspected sepsis.


Title #1459: Preparation and lithium storage performance of yolk-shell Si@void@C nanocomposites.
PMID: 26082288
Authors: Liwei L. Su, Jian J. Xie, Yawei Y. Xu, Lianbang L. Wang, Yuanhao Y. Wang, Manman M. Ren
Abstract: Yolk-shell Si@void@C nanocomposites are prepared via a facile method of resorcinol-formaldehyde coating and LiOH etching, without SiO2 pre-modification on Si particles, expensive carbon sources, or environmentally-unfriendly HF solutions. Profiting from these favorable features, Si@void@C nanocomposites exhibit considerable reversible capacities (628 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles) and good rate performances.


Title #1460: Mesomorphism and electrochemistry of thienoviologen liquid crystals.
PMID: 26082287
Authors: S. S. Cospito, A. A. Beneduci, L. L. Veltri, M. M. Salamonczyk, G. G. Chidichimo
Abstract: The thienoviologen series 4,4'-(2,2'-bithiophene-5,5'-diyl)bis(1-alkylpridinium)X2, with = counterion is a new class of electron acceptor materials which show very interesting electrochromic and electrofluorescence properties. Depending on the length, m, of the promesogenic alkyl chains, and on the counterion, thienoviologens might become liquid crystals. Here, we present the mesomorphic behaviour, and the electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties in solution of new thienoviologens of the series and (I = iodide; NTf2(-) = bis(tri-fuoromethylsulfonyl)imide) with m = 8, 12. Interestingly, we found that only the compounds are liquid crystals, exhibiting a calamitic behaviour in contrast to the homologous compounds of the series with m = 9-11 and X = NTf2(-), which showed columnar rectangular mesophases. The electrochemical study here reported allowed us to explain for the first time the anomalous behaviour of these thienoviologens already observed in cyclic voltammetry, where two apparently irreversible redox processes occur. This can be explained by a comproportionation reaction in which the neutral species rapidly reduces the dication to the radical-cation, due to its strong reducing power. Electrochemical reduction of the thienoviologens causes electrochromism since a new absorption band, occurring at 660 nm in the electronic spectra, appears with the negative potential bias applied. With a LUMO level of 3.64 eV, similar to those of the C60 and of other n-type materials, these compounds can find applications in several electronics devices, where their liquid crystalline properties can be used to control film morphology and geometry, provided they have good electron mobility.


Title #1461: Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome.
PMID: 26082286
Authors: Henrik H. Falhammar, Anna A. NordenstrÃ¶m
Abstract: Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) is one of the most frequent autosomal recessive disorders in man with a prevalence ranging from 0.1Â % in Caucasians up to a few percent in certain ethnic groups. Most cases are never diagnosed due to very mild symptoms, misdiagnosing as polycystic ovary syndrome, or ignorance. In contrast to classic CAH, patients with NCAH present with mild partial cortisol insufficiency and hyperandrogenism and will survive without any treatment. Undiagnosed NCAH may result in infertility, miscarriages, oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, premature pubarche, testicular adrenal rest tumors, adrenal tumors, and voice problems among other symptoms. A baseline measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone can be used for diagnosis, but the ACTH stimulation test with measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is regarded as the golden standard. The diagnosis can be verified by CYP21A2 mutation analysis. Treatment is symptomatic and usually with glucocorticoids alone. The lowest possible glucocorticoid dose should be used. Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids will improve the symptoms but will also result in iatrogenic cortisol insufficiency and may also lead to long-term complications such as obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, osteoporosis, and fractures. Although the complications seen in NCAH patients have been assumed to be related to the glucocorticoid treatment, some may, in fact, be associated with prolonged hyperandrogenism. Different risk factors and negative consequences should be monitored regularly in an attempt to improve the clinical outcome. More research is needed in this relatively common disorder.


Title #1462: QUANTITATIVE PLANAR AND VOLUMETRIC CARDIAC MEASUREMENTS USING 64 MDCT AND 3T MRI VS. STANDARD 2D AND M-MODE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: DOES ANESTHETIC PROTOCOL MATTER?
PMID: 26082285

Abstract: Cross-sectional imaging of the heart utilizing computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior for the evaluation of cardiac morphology and systolic function in humans compared to echocardiography. The purpose of this prospective study was to test the effects of two different anesthetic protocols on cardiac measurements in 10 healthy beagle dogs using 64-multidetector row computed tomographic angiography (64-MDCTA), 3T magnetic resonance (MRI) and standard awake echocardiography. Both anesthetic protocols used propofol for induction and isoflourane for anesthetic maintenance. In addition, protocol A used midazolam/fentanyl and protocol B used dexmedetomedine as premedication and constant rate infusion during the procedure. Significant elevations in systolic and mean blood pressure were present when using protocol B. There was overall good agreement between the variables of cardiac size and systolic function generated from the MDCTA and MRI exams and no significant difference was found when comparing the variables acquired using either anesthetic protocol within each modality. Systolic function variables generated using 64-MDCTA and 3T MRI were only able to predict the left ventricular end diastolic volume as measured during awake echocardiogram when using protocol B and 64-MDCTA. For all other systolic function variables, prediction of awake echocardiographic results was not possible (P = 1). Planar variables acquired using MDCTA or MRI did not allow prediction of the corresponding measurements generated using echocardiography in the awake patients (P = 1). Future studies are needed to validate this approach in a more varied population and clinically affected dogs.


Title #1463: Your own face is no more precious than others': Evidence from the simultaneous-sequential paradigm.
PMID: 26082284
Authors: Suk Won SW. Han, Woo Hyun WH. Jung
Abstract: In the present study, we tested the dominant notion that the processing of familiar faces takes place in an automatic, capacity-unlimited manner. To do so, we had participants perform the task of detecting their own face among others' nonfamiliar faces. Importantly, either all of the search stimuli were presented simultaneously or two different subsets of the stimuli were presented sequentially. The results showed that the search performance benefited from sequential presentation, indicating that detecting one's own face depends on a capacity-limited process. A similar pattern of results was found when participants searched for someone else's face, although there was a decline in the overall performance. These findings suggest that the processes of detecting familiar and unfamiliar faces suffer from the capacity limit of visual perception to similar extents, challenging the notion of the automaticity of familiar-face processing.


Title #1464: Multiple timing of nested intervals: Further evidence for a weighted sumÂ ofÂ segments account.
PMID: 26082283
Authors: Donna D. Bryce, Daniel D. Bratzke
Abstract: How people perceive temporally overlapping intervals can inform us about the architecture and constraints of the human timing system. In the present study, we examined the time perception of two overlapping intervals in a nested context. In this context, one short interval (1Â s) was temporally nested within another long interval (3Â s). The data showed that although participants' perception of the short interval was unaffected by its temporal position within the long interval, estimates of the long interval decreased, the later the short interval appeared. These data indicate that participants perceive two overlapping intervals as three segments that must be summed in order to estimate the long interval. Importantly, the temporal relationships between overlapping intervals affect the estimates, because a recency weighting is applied to each segment during the summing process. Within pacemaker-accumulator models, these results could be seen as supporting a timing system composed of a single pacemaker and a single accumulator, but they could also constrain any account of human interval timing.


Title #1465: Object-substitution masking degrades the quality of conscious object representations.
PMID: 26082282
Authors: Geoffrey W GW. Harrison, Jason J. Rajsic, Daryl E DE. Wilson
Abstract: Object-substitution masking (OSM) is a unique paradigm for the examination of object updating processes. However, existing models of OSM are underspecified with respect to the impact of object updating on the quality of target representations. Using two paradigms of OSM combined with a mixture model analysis we examine the impact of post-perceptual processes on a target's representational quality within conscious awareness. We conclude that object updating processes responsible for OSM cause degradation in the precision of object representations. These findings contribute to a growing body of research advocating for the application of mixture model analysis to the study of how cognitive processes impact the quality (i.e., precision) of object representations.


Title #1466: Men in red: A reexamination of the red-attractiveness effect.
PMID: 26082281
Authors: Vera M VM. Hesslinger, Lisa L. Goldbach, Claus-Christian CC. Carbon
Abstract: Elliot, Kayser, Greitemeyer, Lichtenfeld, Gramzow, Maier, and Liu (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 139(3), 399-417, 2010) showed that presenting men in front of a red background or with a red shirt enhances their attractiveness, sexual desirability, and status in the eyes of female observers. The purpose of the present research was to gain further insights concerning the robustness and the ecological validity of this red effect. In two experiments, we replicated the basic paradigm used by Elliot et al. Experiment 1 was a close replication of the first experiment in their original series. We presented the photo of a young man used by Elliot et al. on either a red or white background and asked participants (N = 89, female subsample n = 72) to rate it with regard to perceived attractiveness. Experiment 2 (N = 32) represents a somewhat more complex version of the first experiment; we increased the variance of the stimuli by showing photos of multiple men wearing different apparel styles (formal and casual, respectively). We did not find any significant impact of red in either of the studies. What we found, however, was a significant effect of apparel style with attractiveness ratings being higher for men wearing formal apparel than for men wearing casual apparel. Our results question the robustness and the ecological validity of Elliot et al.'s finding. On a more general level, they further point to limitations arising from (often necessary) restrictions in experimental designs.


Title #1467: Reevaluating the effectiveness of n-back training on transfer through the Bayesian lens: Support for the null.
PMID: 26082280
Authors: Michael R MR. Dougherty, Toby T. Hamovitz, Joe W JW. Tidwell
Abstract: A recent meta-analysis by Au et al. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 22, 366-377, (2015) reviewed the n-back training paradigm for working memory (WM) and evaluated whether (when aggregating across existing studies) there was evidence that gains obtained for training tasks transferred to gains in fluid intelligence (Gf). Their results revealed an overall effect size of g = 0.24 for the effect of n-back training on Gf. We reexamine the data through a Bayesian lens, to evaluate the relative strength of the evidence for the alternative versus null hypotheses, contingent on the type of control condition used. We find that studies using a noncontact (passive) control group strongly favor the alternative hypothesis that training leads to transfer but that studies using active-control groups show modest evidence in favor of the null. We discuss these findings in the context of placebo effects.


Title #1468: There is no convincing evidence that working memory training is effective: A reply to Au et al. (2014) and Karbach and Verhaeghen (2014).
PMID: 26082279
Authors: Monica M. Melby-LervÃ¥g, Charles C. Hulme
Abstract: The possible cognitive benefits of working memory training programs have been the subject of intense interest and controversy. Recently two meta-analyses have claimed that working memory training can be effective in enhancing cognitive skills in adulthood (Au et al. Behavioural Brain Research 228:(1) 107-115, 2014) and stemming cognitive decline in old age (Karbach & Verhaeghen Psychological Science 25:2027-2037, 2014). The current article critically evaluates these claims. We argue that these meta-analyses produce misleading results because of (1) biases in the studies included, (2) a failure to take account of baseline differences when calculating effect sizes, and (3) a failure to emphasize the difference between studies with treated versus untreated control groups. We present new meta-analyses and conclude that there is no convincing evidence that working memory training produces general cognitive benefits.


Title #1469: Nematicidal activity of the volatilome of Eruca sativa on Meloidogyne incognita.
PMID: 26082278

Abstract: Research on new pesticides based on plant extracts, aiming to the development of nontoxic formulates, has recently gained increased interest. In this paper, we report for the first time on the use of the volatilome of rucola (Eruca sativa) as a powerful natural nematicidal agent against the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Analysis of the composition of the volatilome, using GC-MS-SPME, showed that the compound 3-(Z)-hexenylacetate was the most abundant, followed by, 3-(Z)-hexen-1-ol and erucin, with relative percentages of 22.74 Â± 1.63, 15.93 Â± 2.31 and 8.57 Â± 1.35, respectively. When we tested the nematicidal activity of rucola's volatile compounds, we found that erucin, pentylisothiocyanate, hexylisothiocyanate, 2-(E)-hexenal, 2-ethyl furan, and methylthiocyanate were the most active with an EC50 of 3.2 Â± 1.7, 11.1 Â± 5.0, 11.3 Â± 2.6, 15.0 Â± 3.3, 18.1 Â± 0.6 mg/L, after 24 hours of incubation with J2s. Moreover, the nematicidal activity of fresh rucola used as soil amendant in a containerized culture of tomato, decreased the nematode infection in a dose response manner (EC50=20.03mg/g) and the plant growth was improved. Based on our results, E. sativa can be considered as a promising companion plant in intercropping strategies for tomato growers to control root-knot nematodes.

Title #1471: A Qualitative Exploration of Low-Income Women's Experiences Accessing Abortion in Massachusetts.
PMID: 26082276
Authors: Amanda A. Dennis, Ruth R. Manski, Kelly K. Blanchard
Abstract: At a time when most states are working to restrict abortion, Massachusetts stands out as one of the few states with multiple state-level policies in place that support abortion access for low-income women. In 2006, Massachusetts passed health care reform, which resulted in almost all residents having insurance. Also, almost all state-level public and subsidized insurance programs cover abortion and there are fewer restrictions on abortion in Massachusetts compared with other states.


Title #1472: Surface determination through atomically resolved secondary-electron imaging.
PMID: 26082275

Abstract: Unique determination of the atomic structure of technologically relevant surfaces is often limited by both a need for homogeneous crystals and ambiguity of registration between the surface and bulk. Atomically resolved secondary-electron imaging is extremely sensitive to this registration and is compatible with faceted nanomaterials, but has not been previously utilized for surface structure determination. Here we report a detailed experimental atomic-resolution secondary-electron microscopy analysis of the c(6 Ã 2) reconstruction on strontium titanate (001) coupled with careful simulation of secondary-electron images, density functional theory calculations and surface monolayer-sensitive aberration-corrected plan-view high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Our work reveals several unexpected findings, including an amended registry of the surface on the bulk and strontium atoms with unusual seven-fold coordination within a typically high surface coverage of square pyramidal TiO5 units. Dielectric screening is found to play a critical role in attenuating secondary-electron generation processes from valence orbitals.


Title #1473: Obesity and the microbiome.
PMID: 26082274
Authors: Ruchi R. Mathur, Gillian M GM. Barlow
Abstract: Obesity constitutes a significant and rapidly increasing public health challenge and is associated with significant co-morbidities and healthcare costs. Although undoubtedly multifactorial, research over the last decade has demonstrated that the microbes that colonize the human gut may contribute to the development of obesity through roles in polysaccharide breakdown, nutrient absorption, inflammatory responses and gut permeability. Studies have consistently shown that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, in particular, is increased in obesity and reduces with weight loss. In addition, we and others have shown that the methanogenic Archaea may also contribute to altered metabolism and weight gain in the host. However, much remains to be learned about the roles of different gut microbial populations in weight gain and obesity and the underlying mechanisms before we can begin to approach targeted treatments.


Title #1474: Self-seeding microwell chip for the isolation and characterization of single cells.
PMID: 26082273
Authors: Joost F JF. Swennenhuis, Arjan G J AG. Tibbe, Michiel M. Stevens, Madhumohan R MR. Katika, Joost J. van Dalum, Hien H. Duy Tong, Cees J M CJ. van Rijn, Leon W M M LW. Terstappen
Abstract: A self-seeding microwell chip is introduced for the isolation and interrogation of single cells. A cell suspension is transferred to a microwell chip containing 6400 microwells, each microwell with a single 5 Î¼m pore in the bottom. The fluid enters the microwell and drags a cell onto the pore. After a cell has landed onto the pore, it will stop the fluid flow through this microwell. The remaining fluid and cells will be diverted to the next available microwell. This results in a fast and efficient distribution of single cells in individual microwells. After identification by fluorescence microscopy, the cells of interest are isolated from the microwell by punching the bottom together with the cell. The overall single cell recovery of seeding followed by isolation of the single cell, is >70% with a specificity of 100% as confirmed by the genetic make-up of the isolated cells.


Title #1475: Pentoxifylline Decreases Dialysis Risk in Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease.
PMID: 26082272
Authors: Pei-Chen PC. Wu, Chih-Jen CJ. Wu, Cheng-Jui CJ. Lin, Chi-Feng CF. Pan, Chih-Yang CY. Chen, Tao-Min TM. Huang, Che-Hsiung CH. Wu, Shuei-Liong SL. Lin, Yung-Ming YM. Chen, Likwang L. Chen, Vin-Cent VC. Wu, 
Abstract: Few studies evaluated the effects of pentoxifylline on hard endpoints in patients with predialysis stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). We thus tried to explore the effects of pentoxifylline and its interaction with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. This nationwide cohort study retrospectively included patients who had a serum creatinine level ofâ>â6 mg/dL and received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents between 2000 and 2010. We analyzed 7,366 pentoxifylline users and 7,366 propensity score-matched nonusers. Using Cox proportional hazard models, pentoxifylline reduced the risks of ESRD and the composite renal outcome but not that of mortality. In terms of the risks of developing ESRD, pentoxifylline alone exerted a comparable beneficial effect to combined therapy with an RAAS inhibitor and greater renoprotection than RAAS inhibitor monotherapy. This study suggests pentoxifylline is efficacious in slowing progression to ESRD in patients with predialysis stage 5 CKD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.


Title #1476: Diamond monohydride: the most stable three-dimensional hydrocarbon.
PMID: 26082271
Authors: Mikhail V MV. Kondrin, Vadim V VV. Brazhkin
Abstract: Most of the hydrocarbons are either molecular structures or linear polymeric chains. Discovery of graphene and manufacturing of its monohydride - graphane have incited interest in the search for three-dimensional hydrocarbon polymers. However, up to now all hypothetical hydrocarbon lattices significantly have lost in terms of energy to stacked graphane sheets and solid benzene. We propose a completely covalently bonded solid carbon monohydride, whose density significantly exceeds that of one of its isomers (graphane, cubane, and solid benzene). Ab initio calculations demonstrate that the cohesion energy of this structure at least is not worse than the energy of graphane and benzene. In some aspect, the crystal structure of the hydrocarbon presented can be regarded as a sublattice of diamond, but with the symmetry of the P3[combining macron] space group (lattice parameters: a â 6.925 Ã and c â 12.830 Ã) and Z = 42 formula units per unit cell. This structure may have interesting applications.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 11q23/MLL rearrangement (MLL-r AML) is allocated to the intermediate or high-risk cytogenetic prognostic category depending on the MLL fusion partner. A more favourable outcome has been reported in patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), but this has not been confirmed in large series. We analyzed the outcome of alloHSCT among adult patients reported to the ALWP between 2000 and 2010. We identified 159 patients with 11q23/MLL rearranged AML allografted in first complete remission (CR1, n=138) or CR2, mostly corresponding to t(9;11), t(11;19), t(6;11), and t(10;11) translocations. Two-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse incidence (RI), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 56Â±4%, 51Â±4%, 31Â±3%, and 17Â±4%, respectively. The outcome differed according to 11q23/MLL rearrangement, being more favourable in patients with t(9;11) and t(11;19) compared to t(10;11) and t(6;11) (2-year OS: 64Â±6% and 73Â±10% vs 40Â±13% and 24Â±11%, respectively; P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis for OS identified t(6;11), t(10;11), age>40 years and CR2 as unfavourable features, whereas t(6;11), t(10;11), CR2 and the use of RIC regimen affected poorly LFS. This study confirms the potential role of alloHSCT for adult patients with 11q23/MLL rearranged AML in CR1.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 17 June 2015. doi:10.1038/leu.2015.143.


Title #1478: Eating out of home and dietary adequacy in preschool children.
PMID: 26082269
Authors: Teresa T. Moreira, Milton M. Severo, Andreia A. Oliveira, Elisabete E. Ramos, Sara S. Rodrigues, Carla C. Lopes
Abstract: The present study aims to describe dietary intake and dietary adequacy according to eating location in preschool children. A sub-sample of 2414 children from the Generation XXI birth cohort (Porto, Portugal), evaluated during the follow-up between 2009 and 2011, was included. Dietary intake was assessed by 3Â d food diaries and four groups of children were defined according to the eating location: 'Home' (Â â¥Â 80Â % of meals at home), 'Other homes', 'Preschool' and 'Restaurants'. A dietary adequacy index was developed based on general recommendations for children; a higher score represents a better dietary adequacy. The comparison of nutrients and foods daily intake according to the eating location groups was performed by ANOVA and ANCOVA to adjust for potential confounders. Children classified in 'Preschool' group ate significantly more vegetables, fruit, bread and fish, and less meat, compared to children classified into the 'Home' group. Children classified in the 'Restaurants' group ate more cakes, salty snacks and fruit juices than children in 'Home' group; and less vegetables, dairy products and pasta/rice/potatoes. In 'Restaurants' children obtained the lowest mean score of the dietary adequacy index (15Â·5, 95Â % CI 14Â·8, 16Â·3) and in 'Preschool' children had the highest mean score (18Â·3, 95Â % CI 18Â·1, 18Â·4), corresponding to a better dietary adequacy. Preschools seem to have a relevant role in promoting the intake of healthy foods in preschool children. The consumption in restaurants/coffee shops seems to contribute to energy-dense food intake and reduced consumption of nutrient-dense foods.

Abstract: To investigate whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of a tumor is associated with recurrence after nephrectomy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 49 patients with localized RCC who underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging preoperatively. Fifteen patients had recurrent disease after surgery. The ADC was measured by placing a region-of-interest in a solid region of each tumor on the ADC map. We named the average value of the three ADC values the "average ADC" and the lowest ADC value among the three as the "minimum ADC." The correlations between clinicopathological factors including patient age and gender, tumor side, tumor size, growth/invasion pattern, Fuhrman grade, histological subtype, venous invasion, average and minimum ADCs, and disease-free survival were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model.

Abstract: To counter environmental cues, cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) have evolved adaptive mechanisms requiring regulation of downstream genes. The Dehydration-Responsive Element-Binding Protein 2 (DREB2) transcription factors regulate abiotic stresses responses in plants. Herein we isolated a novel DREB2-type regulator involved in salinity response, named SlDREB2. Spatio-temporal expression profile together with investigation of its promoter activity indicated that SlDREB2 is expressed during early stages of seedling establishment and in various vegetative and reproductive organs of adult plants. SlDREB2 is up-regulated in roots and young leaves following exposure to NaCl, but is also induced by KCl and drought. Its overexpression in WT Arabidopsis and atdreb2a mutants improved seed germination and plant growth in presence of different osmotica. In tomato, SlDREB2 affected vegetative and reproductive organs development and the intronic sequence present in the 5' UTR drives its expression. Physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic analyses showed that SlDREB2 enhanced plant tolerance to salinity by improvement of K(+) /Na(+) ratio, and proline and polyamines biosynthesis. Exogenous hormonal treatments (abscisic acid, auxin and cytokinins) and analysis of WT and 35S::SlDREB2 tomatoes hormonal contents highlighted SlDREB2 involvement in abscisic acid biosynthesis/signaling. Altogether, our results provide an overview of SlDREB2 mode of action during early salt stress response.


Title #1483: Selective Colorimetric Detection of Hydrogen Sulfide Based on Primary Amine-Active Ester Crosslinking of Gold Nanoparticles.
PMID: 26082264
Authors: Zhiqin Z. Yuan, Fengniu F. Lu, Meihua M. Peng, Chia-Wei CW. Wang, Yu-Ting YT. Tseng, Yi Y. Du, Na N. Cai, Chia-Wen CW. Lien, Huan-Tsung HT. Chang, Yan Y. He, Edward S ES. Yeung
Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a highly toxic environmental pollutant and also an important gaseous transmitter, thus selective detection of H2S is very important; and visual detection of it with naked eye is preferred in practical applications. In this study, thiolated azide derivates and active esters functionalized gold nanoparticles (AE-AuNPs) based nanosensors have been successfully prepared for H2S perception. The sensing principle consists of two steps: first, H2S reduces azide group to primary amine; second, crosslinking reaction between primary amine and active ester induces the aggregation of AuNPs. The AE-AuNPs based nanosensors show high selectivity towards H2S over other anions and thiols due to the specific azide-H2S chemistry. Under optimal conditions, 0.2 ÂµM H2S is detectable using UV-vis spectrophotometer and 4 ÂµM H2S can be easily detected by the naked eye. In addition, the practical application of the designed nanosensors was evaluated with lake water samples.

PMID: 26082262
Authors: Gian Paolo GP. Caviglia, Maria Lorena ML. Abate, Elisa E. Petrini, Silvia S. Gaia, Mario M. Rizzetto, Antonina A. Smedile
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops with high incidence in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), and particularly in those with cirrhosis. Currently, diagnosis and surveillance are mainly based on imaging-methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of highly sensitive measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3) and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) alone and in combination, for HCC detection. In addition, a recently proposed statistical model, including these three biomarkers plus gender and age, the GALAD model was applied.


Title #1486: Surface microbial contamination in hospitals: A pilot study on methods of sampling and the use of proposed microbiologic standards.
PMID: 26082261
Authors: TÃ¢nia T. Claro, Marese M. O'Reilly, Stephen S. Daniels, Hilary H. Humphreys
Abstract: Contamination of hospital surfaces by bacteria is increasingly recognized. We assessed commonly touched surfaces using contact plates and Petrifilms (3M, St. Paul, MN) and compared the results against proposed microbiology standards. Toilet door handles were the most heavily contaminated (7.97Â Â±Â 0.68 colony forming units [CFU]/cm(2)) and exceeded proposed standards on 74% of occasions. Petrifilms detected statistically higher CFU from bedside lockers. Further research is required on the use of standards and methods of sampling.

Authors: Barbara B. Testoni, David D. Durantel, Fanny F. LebossÃ©, Judith J. Fresquet, FranÃ§ois F. Helle, Francesco F. Negro, Maria Francesca MF. Donato, Massimo M. Levrero, Fabien F. Zoulim
Abstract: Caveats in the understanding of ribavirin (RBV) mechanisms of action has somehow prevented the development of better analogues able to further improve its therapeutic contribution in interferon (IFN)-based and direct antiviral agent-based regimens for chronic HCV or other indications. Here, we describe a new mechanism by which RBV modulates IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and contributes to restore hepatic immune responsiveness.


Title #1490: [Surgical treatment in degenerative scoliosis].
PMID: 26082257
Authors: Xiangyu X. Tang, Yonggang Y. Zhang
Abstract: Degenerative scoliosis is one of the important reasons of low back pain in middle-aged and elderly. The surgical treatment has been gradually paid more attention to in recent years. Pain and the quality of life are the key points of the surgical treatment. In addition to neurogenic compression,clinical symptoms and health-related quality of life are also closely related to the three-dimensional deformity of spine. Researchers try to employ different classifications of degenerative scoliosis to guide personalizedly surgical treatment. In the future,osteoporosis and complications may be the research highlights in the surgical treatment of degenerative scoliosis.

Title #1503: [Effective ways to improve the prognosis of advanced stage (BCLC stage C) hepatocellular carcinoma].
PMID: 26082244
Authors: Shuqun S. Cheng, Xubiao X. Wei, Mengchao M. Wu
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) or lymphatic/extrahepatic metastasis is classified as advanced stage (Stage C of Bacelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging). There is few effective therapy for the advanced stage HCC, leading to an extremly poor prognosis. For these patients, Sorafinib is recommended as the only therapy by European and American guidelines, which has limited clinic effect. In China, besides Sorafinib, various therapies have also been suggested, including surgery, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiotherapy, as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, it is reported that several therapies may be effective in treating HCC with PVTT which is classified based on Cheng's classification, including surgery after "down-stage" radiotherapy, early use of sorafinib postoperatively, as well as postoperative antivirus treatment. The modified Folfox4 chemotherapy, is also a potential effective way to improve the prognosis of advanced stage HCC with lymphatic/extrahepatic metastasis. Mutiple disciplinary team which could faciliate the process of diagnosis and treatment of advanced stage HCC, is expected to favor the prognosis of these patients.


Title #1504: [Precise surgery].
PMID: 26082243
Authors: Jiahong J. Dong, Ning N. Zhang
Abstract: Surgery has passed through an intuitive and an empirical era and has now entered its modern phase. The enormous progress in biomedicine, the rise of evidence-based medicine and the consensus on the need for humanistic patient care, have laid a foundation for a new surgical paradigm. Based on a series of studies and practices, we advocated the concept of 'Precision Surgery'. It covers the entire operation-centered surgical practice. The strategy of precision surgery is to seek a balance of maximizing the removal of the target lesion, while maximizing the functional liver remnant and minimizing surgical invasiveness. We propose that the concept of precision surgery should be considered for wider application within liver surgery and various surgical fields, and finally realize the multi-objective optimization with certainty-based practice to ensure maximized recovery for each patient.


Title #1505: High expression of IL-9R promotes the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma and indicates a poor clinical outcome.
PMID: 26082242

Abstract: Interleukin-9 receptor (IL-9R) overexpression has a pivotal role in human hematological malignancies. However, the expression of IL-9R and its biological role in human solid tumors remains elusive. In the present study, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR were used to determine the expression of IL-9R in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and tumor tissues. Proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and Transwell assays were used to examine the biological role of IL-9R in HCC cells. The results showed that IL-9R and its ligand IL-9 were constitutively expressed in HCC cells and tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of IL-9R and IL-9 were significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to the peritumor liver tissues. Functional experiments suggested that IL-9R significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation, invasion and inhibited apoptosis, possibly by acting through the IL-9/IL-9R axis. After silencing IL-9R, the expression of VEGF, p-p38, p-STAT3 and MMP9, markedly decreased suggesting the potential involvement of these molecules in IL-9R activity. Immunohistochemistryâbased survival analysis revealed that a differential expression of IL-9R in HCC tissue was a significant and independent prognostic factor for survival [HR, 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.36; P=0.005] and recurrence [HR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.04â2.17; P=0.03]. In addition, a high IL-9R expression positively and significantly correlated with larger (P=0.012) and advanced tumor stage (P=0.018). The findings indicated that IL-9R was constitutively expressed and exerted a tumor-promoting effect in HCC, whose expression level may be a useful biomarker of tumor invasiveness and patient clinical outcome.

Title #1507: HIV-infected sex workers with beneficial HLA-variants are potential hubs for selection of HIV-1 recombinants that may affect disease progression.

Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against the HIV Gag protein are associated with lowering viremia; however, immune control is undermined by viral escape mutations. The rapid viral mutation rate is a key factor, but recombination may also contribute. We hypothesized that CTL responses drive the outgrowth of unique intra-patient HIV-recombinants (URFs) and examined gag sequences from a Kenyan sex worker cohort. We determined whether patients with HLA variants associated with effective CTL responses (beneficial HLA variants) were more likely to carry URFs and, if so, examined whether they progressed more rapidly than patients with beneficial HLA-variants who did not carry URFs. Women with beneficial HLA-variants (12/52) were more likely to carry URFs than those without beneficial HLA variants (3/61) (pâ<â0.0055; odds ratioâ=â5.7). Beneficial HLA variants were primarily found in slow/standard progressors in the URF group, whereas they predominated in long-term non-progressors/survivors in the remaining cohort (pâ=â0.0377). The URFs may sometimes spread and become circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV and local CRF fragments were over-represented in the URF sequences (pâ<â0.0001). Collectively, our results suggest that CTL-responses associated with beneficial HLA variants likely drive the outgrowth of URFs that might reduce the positive effect of these CTL responses on disease progression.

Abstract: The combination of porous graphitized carbon (PGC) liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometric (MS) detection probably constitutes the most elaborate single stage analysis for isomer-specific N-glycan analysis.

Abstract: Oligo- and polysialic acids (oligo/polySia) are involved in numerous biological processes depending on the chain length, the comprised type of sialic acids, as well as the glycosidic linkages. Here, we describe the determination of the composition, the sequence, as well as the linkages between the sialic acid residues of lactonized oligo/polySia using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)(/MS) and electrospray-ionization (ESI)-MS((n)).

Abstract: Design of drug with prolonged therapeutic action is one of the rapid developing fields of modern medical science and required implementation of different methods of protein chemistry and molecular biology. There are several therapeutic proteins needing increasing of their stability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics parameters. To make long-live DNA-encoded drug PEGylation was proposed. Alternatively polysialic (colominic) acid, extracted from the cell wall of E. coli, fractionated to the desired size by anion-exchange chromatography and chemically activated to the amine-reactive aldehyde form, may be chemically attached to the polypeptide chain. Conjugates of proteins and polysialic acid generally resemble properties of protein-PEG conjugates, but possess significant negative net charge and are thought to be fully degradable after endocytosis due to the presence of intracellular enzymes, hydrolyzing the polysialic acid. Complete biodegradation of the polysialic acid moiety makes this kind of conjugates preferable for creation of drugs, intended for chronic use. Here, we describe two different protocols of chemical polysialylation. First protocol was employed for the CHO-derived human butyrylcholinesterase with optimized for recovery of specific enzyme activity. Polysialic acid moieties are attached at various lysine residues. Another protocol was developed for high-yield conjugation of human insulin; major conjugation point is the N-terminal residue of the insulin's light chain. These methods may allow to produce polysialylated conjugates of various proteins or polypeptides with reasonable yield and without significant loss of functional activity.


Title #1512: Chemoenzymatic Glyco-engineering of Monoclonal Antibodies.
PMID: 26082235
Authors: John P JP. Giddens, Lai-Xi LX. Wang
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an important class of therapeutic glycoproteins widely used for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. Compelling data have shown that the presence and fine structures of the conserved N-glycans at the Fc domain can profoundly affect the effector functions of antibodies. However, mAbs are usually produced as mixtures of Fc glycoforms and the control of glycosylation to a favorable, homogeneous status in various host expression systems is still a challenging task. In this chapter, we describe a detailed procedure of chemoenzymatic glyco-engineering of monoclonal antibodies, using rituximab (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody) as a model system. The protocol includes the deglycosylation of a mAb by an endoglycosidase (such as wild type EndoS) to remove the heterogeneous Fc N-glycans, leaving only the innermost GlcNAc or the core-fucosylated GlcNAc at the glycosylation site. Then the deglycosylated IgG serves as an acceptor for an endoglycosidase-catalyzed transglycosylation to add a desired N-glycan to the GlcNAc acceptor to reconstitute a defined, homogeneous natural glycoform of IgG, using a glycosynthase mutant as the enzyme and activated glycan oxazoline as the donor substrate. A semi-synthesis of sialylated and asialylated biantennary N-glycan oxazolines is also described. This detailed procedure can be used for the Fc glycosylation remodeling of other mAbs to provide homogeneous Fc glycoforms for various applications.


Title #1513: Evaluation of Quenching and Extraction Methods for Nucleotide/Nucleotide Sugar Analysis.
PMID: 26082234
Authors: Katrin K. Braasch, Carina C. VillacrÃ©s, Michael M. Butler
Abstract: Nucleotide sugars are the donor substrates of glycosyltransferases and their availability is known to have an impact on the glycosylation of recombinant proteins including monoclonal antibodies. In addition, the intracellular concentration levels of these metabolites can provide information about the physiological/energetic state of the cell. Therefore, the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the intracellular nucleotides and nucleotide sugars can give valuable insight into the metabolism associated with the glycosylation processes in cells. However, in order to be able to perform a consistent and reliable time specific analysis of these metabolites during a cell culture the metabolism of the cell needs to be stopped immediately at the point of sampling and an efficient extraction needs to be performed. Once the nucleotides and nucleotide sugars are extracted from the cell sample an efficient HPLC method is needed to separate all or most of the metabolites of interest to allow for their identification and quantification. Here, we describe an optimized method for the analysis of the intracellular nucleotide/nucleotide sugar pool in CHO suspension cells which includes protocols for quenching, extraction and HPLC analysis.


Title #1514: Metabolic Glyco-Engineering in Eukaryotic Cells and Selected Applications.
PMID: 26082233
Authors: Friedrich F. Piller, Aline A. Mongis, VÃ©ronique V. Piller
Abstract: By metabolic glyco-engineering cellular glycoconjugates are modified through the incorporation of synthetic monosaccharides which are usually analogues of naturally present sugars. In order to get incorporated, the monosaccharides need to enter the cytoplasm and to be substrates for the enzymes necessary for their transformation into activated sugars, most often nucleotide sugars. These have to be substrates for glycosyltransferases which finally catalyze their incorporation into glycans. Such pathways are difficult to reconstitute in vitro and therefore new monosaccharide analogues have to be tested in tissue culture for their suitability in metabolic glyco-engineering. For this, glycosylation mutants are the most appropriate since they are unable to synthesize specific glycans but through the introduction of the monosaccharide analogues they may express some glycans at the cell surface with the unnatural sugar incorporated. The presence of those glycans can be easily and quantitatively detected by lectin binding or by chemical methods identifying specific sugars. Monosaccharide analogues can also block the pathways leading to sugar incorporation, thus inhibiting the synthesis of glycan structures which is also easily detectable at the cell surface by lectin labeling. The most useful and most frequently employed application of metabolic glyco-engineering is the introduction of reactive groups which can undergo bio-orthogonal click reactions for the efficient labeling of glycans at the surface of live cells.


Title #1515: Production of Highly Sialylated Recombinant Glycoproteins Using Ricinus communis Agglutinin-I-Resistant CHO Glycosylation Mutants.
PMID: 26082232
Authors: John S Y JS. Goh, Kah Fai KF. Chan, Zhiwei Z. Song
Abstract: The degree of sialylation of therapeutic glycoproteins affects its circulatory half-life and efficacy because incompletely sialylated glycoproteins are cleared from circulation by asialoglycoprotein receptors present in the liver cells. Mammalian expression systems, often employed in the production of these glycoprotein drugs, produce heterogeneously sialylated products. Here, we describe how to produce highly sialylated glycoproteins using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell glycosylation mutant called CHO-gmt4 with human erythropoietin (EPO) as a model glycoprotein. The protocol describes how to isolate and characterize the CHO glycosylation mutants and how to assess the sialylation of the recombinant protein using isoelectric focusing (IEF). It further describes how to inactivate the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in these cells using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to enable gene amplification and the generation of stable cell lines producing highly sialylated EPO.


Title #1516: Glycan Remodeling with Processing Inhibitors and Lectin-Resistant Eukaryotic Cells.
PMID: 26082231
Authors: Veronica T VT. Chang, Robert A RA. Spooner, Max M. Crispin, Simon J SJ. Davis
Abstract: Some of the most important and interesting molecules in metazoan biology are glycoproteins. The importance of the carbohydrate component of these structures is often revealed by the disease phenotypes that manifest when the biosynthesis of particular glycoforms is disrupted. On the other hand, the presence of large amounts of carbohydrate can often hinder the structural and functional analysis of glycoproteins. There are often good reasons, therefore, for wanting to engineer and predefine the N-glycans present on glycoproteins, e.g., in order to characterize the functions of the glycans or facilitate their subsequent removal. Here, we describe in detail two distinct ways in which to usefully interfere with oligosaccharide processing, one involving the use of specific processing inhibitors, and the other the selection of cell lines mutated at gene loci that control oligosaccharide processing, using cytotoxic lectins. Both approaches have the capacity for controlled, radical alteration of oligosaccharide processing in eukaryotic cells used for heterologous protein expression, and have great utility in the structural analysis of glycoproteins.


Title #1517: Strategies for Engineering Protein N-Glycosylation Pathways in Mammalian Cells.
PMID: 26082230
Authors: Qiong Q. Wang, Mark M. Stuczynski, Yuan Y. Gao, Michael J MJ. Betenbaugh
Abstract: Complexity and heterogeneity of oligosaccharides present a considerable challenge to the biopharmaceutical industry to manufacture biotherapeutics with reproducible and consistent glycoform profiles. Mammalian cells, especially Chinese hamster ovary cells, are the most widely used platform for the production of biotherapeutics. The glycans produced are predominantly of the complex type, with some differences between human and nonhuman mammalian glycosylation existing. This review briefly summarizes metabolic glyco-engineering strategies used in mammalian cells in order to alter the glycosylation patterns attached to proteins applied for diverse biotechnology applications.


Title #1518: Assembly of Multigene Constructs Using Golden Gate Cloning.
PMID: 26082229
Authors: Sylvestre S. Marillonnet, Stefan S. Werner
Abstract: Efficient DNA assembly methods are required for synthetic biology. Standardization of DNA parts is an essential element that not only facilitates reuse of the same parts for various constructs but also allows standardization of the assembly strategy. We provide here a protocol for assembly of multigene constructs from standard biological parts using the modular cloning system MoClo. Making constructs using this system requires to first define the structure of the final construct and to identify all basic parts and vectors required for the construction strategy. The cloning strategy is in large part determined by the structure of the final construct, which is then made using a series of one-pot Golden Gate cloning reactions.


Title #1519: Subcellular Targeting of Proteins Involved in Modification of Plant N- and O-Glycosylation.
PMID: 26082228
Authors: Martina M. Dicker, Jennifer J. Schoberer, Ulrike U. Vavra, Richard R. Strasser
Abstract: Plants are attractive expression hosts for the production of recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics. The quality and efficiency of these biopharmaceuticals are very often influenced by the glycosylation profile. Consequently, approaches are needed that enable the production of recombinant glycoproteins with customized and homogenous N- and O-glycan structures. Here, we describe convenient tools that allow targeting and retention of glycan-modifying enzymes in the early secretory pathway of plants. These protocols can be used to fine-tune the subcellular localization of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in plants and consequently to increase the homogeneity of glycosylation on recombinant glycoproteins.


Title #1520: Transient Glyco-Engineering of N. benthamiana Aiming at the Synthesis of Multi-antennary Sialylated Proteins.
PMID: 26082227
Authors: Andreas A. Loos, Alexandra A. Castilho
Abstract: Recombinantly produced therapeutic proteins bring benefits to patients and production companies alike. However, due to high production costs the potential of this technology cannot be fully tapped and therefor safe, scalable, and economic alternatives to the standard mammalian cell culture-based manufacturing systems are needed. Plant-based expression systems with their current technological advances constitute such an alternative. Many recombinant biopharmaceuticals are glycoproteins and their structural properties and pharmacokinetics are strongly influenced by their glycosylation profile. Differences in glycosylation between plants and mammals can for this reason result in different therapeutic efficacies. In particular, low levels of sialylation may lead to a short serum half-life of therapeutic proteins and nonhuman types of glycosylation can induce degradation and immunogenic responses. Controlling glycosylation of plant-derived therapeutics is therefore fundamental to enhance their efficacy and eliminate possible adverse effects caused by non-authentic glycosylation. Here we describe methods to transiently express high levels of recombinant proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana and simultaneously modulate their glycosylation pattern towards the synthesis of highly sialylated humanlike structures.


Title #1521: Im"plant"ing of Mammalian Glycosyltransferase Gene into Plant Suspension-Cultured Cells Using Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation.
PMID: 26082226
Authors: Hiroyuki H. Kajiura, Kazuhito K. Fujiyama
Abstract: Enzymatic activity assay of exogenous glycosyltransferase (GT) and glycosylhydrolase (GH) expressed in plants is an important analysis for determination of the expression of the gene of interest. However, generations and establishment of in planta transgenic lines are time-consuming. Furthermore, the expression levels and the activities of the exogenous GTs and GHs are quite low and weak, the radiolabeled donor substrate had to be used to analyze the enzymatic activity. Here, we describe a protocol for the generation of transgenic plants using suspension-cultured cells and a high sensitive assay for GT, especially Î²1,4-galactosyltransferase, using microsomal fraction from plant cells and fluorescent-labeled sugar chains as an acceptor substrate. This method enables less-time-consuming preparation of stable transgenic plants, non-radiolabeled, high-throughput detail analysis which includes mass spectrometric analysis and exo-glycosidase digestions.


Title #1522: Gene Targeting for Precision Glyco-Engineering: Production of Biopharmaceuticals Devoid of Plant-Typical Glycosylation in Moss Bioreactors.
PMID: 26082225
Authors: Eva L EL. Decker, Gertrud G. Wiedemann, Ralf R. Reski
Abstract: One of the main challenges for the production of biopharmaceuticals in plant-based systems is the modulation of plant-specific glycosylation patterns towards a humanized form. Posttranslational modifications in plants are similar to those in humans, but several differences affect product quality and efficacy and can also cause immune responses in patients. In the moss Physcomitrella patens highly efficient gene targeting via homologous recombination enables glyco-engineering to obtain suitable platform lines for the production of recombinant proteins and biopharmaceuticals. Here we describe the methods which are effective for creating gene targeting constructs and transgenic moss lines as well as confirming successful homologous integration of the constructs and modification of target gene expression.


Title #1523: N-Glyco-Engineering in Plants: Update on Strategies and Major Achievements.
PMID: 26082224
Authors: Herta H. Steinkellner, Alexandra A. Castilho
Abstract: Plants are being developed as a cost-effective production system for biopharmaceuticals in large quantities. Although plants properly fold and assemble complex proteins from human origin, one issue that needs to be addressed is their glycan structure. In the past years we have been witnessing outstanding results in targeted manipulation of the plant N-glycosylation pathway allowing recombinant proteins to be produced with human-type oligosaccharides at large homogeneity. This opens new possibility in manufacturing next-generation biopharmaceuticals.This review presents a variety of technologies and strategies that are being employed to engineer the plant N-glycosylation, thus pointing to the enormous potential of plants being used as a novel production system with unique features and possibilities.


Title #1524: Engineering N-Glycosylation Pathway in Insect Cells: Suppression of Î²-N-Acetylglucosaminidase and Expression of Î²-1,4-Galactosyltransferase.
PMID: 26082223
Authors: Yeon Kyu YK. Kim, Hyung Joon HJ. Cha
Abstract: Most insect cells have a simple N-glycosylation process and consequently paucimannosidic or simple core glycans predominate. It has been proposed that Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase), a hexosaminidase in the Golgi membrane which removes a terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), might contribute to simple N-glycosylation profile in several insect cells including Drosophila S2. Here, we describe GlcNAcase suppression strategy using RNA interference (RNAi) to avoid the formation of paucimannosidic glycans in insect S2 cells. In addition, we describe coexpression of Î²(1,4)-galactosyltransferase (GalT) as a strategy to improve N-glycosylation pattern and enable recombinant therapeutic proteins to be produced in S2 cells with more complex N-glycans.


Title #1525: Engineering Sialic Acid Synthesis Ability in Insect Cells.
PMID: 26082222
Authors: Karthik K. Viswanathan, Someet S. Narang, Michael J MJ. Betenbaugh
Abstract: Insect cells lack the ability to synthesize the sialic acid donor molecule CMP-sialic acid or its precursor, sialic acid. In this chapter, we describe a method to engineer CMP-sialic acid synthesis capability into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, a prototypical insect cell line, by recombinant expression of sialic acid synthesis pathway genes using baculovirus technology. Co-expression of a sialuria mutant UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (EKR263L), wild-type sialic acid 9-phosphate synthase (SAS), and wild-type CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSAS) in the presence of GlcNAc leads to synthesis of CMP-sialic acids synthesis to support sialylation of N-glycans on glycoproteins.


Title #1526: SweetBac: Applying MultiBac Technology Towards Flexible Modification of Insect Cell Glycosylation.
PMID: 26082221
Authors: Dieter D. Palmberger, Dubravko D. Rendic
Abstract: Observed different glycosylation patterns of glycoconjugates (recombinantly) produced in various eukaryotic organisms are a direct consequence of differences in numerous proteins involved in biosynthesis of the relevant glycan chains in these species. The need for efficient, robust and flexible methods for recombinant expression of proteins is met by the recently described MultiBac technology, an advanced and optimized baculovirus-based system for simultaneous recombinant protein expression in insect cells. A derivative of MultiBac technology, the SweetBac system aims at the modification of the glycosylation potential of insect cells as expression hosts. The application of SweetBac, including the methods needed to investigate the glycosylation pattern of the purified recombinant protein, is described in this chapter.


Title #1527: An Overview and History of Glyco-Engineering in Insect Expression Systems.
PMID: 26082220
Authors: Christoph C. Geisler, Hideaki H. Mabashi-Asazuma, Donald L DL. Jarvis
Abstract: Insect systems, including the baculovirus-insect cell and Drosophila S2 cell systems are widely used as recombinant protein production platforms. Historically, however, no insect-based system has been able to produce glycoproteins with human-type glycans, which often influence the clinical efficacy of therapeutic glycoproteins and the overall structures and functions of other recombinant glycoprotein products. In addition, some insect cell systems produce N-glycans with immunogenic epitopes. Over the past 20 years, these problems have been addressed by efforts to glyco-engineer insect-based expression systems. These efforts have focused on introducing the capacity to produce complex-type, terminally sialylated N-glycans and eliminating the capacity to produce immunogenic N-glycans. Various glyco-engineering approaches have included genetically engineering insect cells, baculoviral vectors, and/or insects with heterologous genes encoding the enzymes required to produce various glycosyltransferases, sugars, nucleotide sugars, and nucleotide sugar transporters, as well as an enzyme that can deplete GDP-fucose. In this chapter, we present an overview and history of glyco-engineering in insect expression systems as a prelude to subsequent chapters, which will highlight various methods used for this purpose.


Title #1528: Development of a Valuable Yeast Strain Using a Novel Mutagenesis Technique for the Effective Production of Therapeutic Glycoproteins.
PMID: 26082219
Authors: Hiroko H. Abe, Ken-Ichi K. Nakayama
Abstract: The so-called disparity mutagenesis technique selectively elevates mutation in the lagging strand of DNA by using a mutant form of DNA polymerase Î´, encoded on a proofreading-deficient pol3 gene. This novel mutagenesis technique generates a pool of mutants that includes a no-mutant strain together with mutant strains carrying multiple mutations. By using a suitable screening system it is possible to isolate the desired mutant strain from this pool of mutants. Here, we used our novel mutagenesis technique to isolate a yeast strain with good growth characteristics that was glycosylation deficient.


Title #1529: Engineering the Pichia pastoris N-Glycosylation Pathway Using the GlycoSwitch Technology.
PMID: 26082218
Authors: Bram B. Laukens, Charlot C. De Wachter, Nico N. Callewaert
Abstract: Pichia pastoris is an important host for recombinant protein production. As a protein production platform, further development for therapeutic glycoproteins has been hindered by the high-mannose-type N-glycosylation common to yeast and fungi. Such N-glycans can complicate downstream processing, might be immunogenic or cause the rapid clearance of the glycoprotein from circulation. In recent years, much effort has gone to engineering the N-glycosylation pathway of Pichia pastoris to mimic the human N-glycosylation pathway. This can be of pivotal importance to generate the appropriate glycoforms of therapeutically relevant glycoproteins or to gain a better understanding of structure-function relationships.This chapter describes the methodology to create such glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris strains using the GlycoSwitch(Â®). This strategy consists of the disruption of an endogenous glycosyltransferase and the heterologous expression of a glycosidase or glycosyltransferase targeted to the Endoplasmic Reticulum or the Golgi of the host. For each step in the process, we describe the transformation procedure, small-scale screening and we also describe how to perform DNA-Sequencer-Aided Fluorophore-Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis (DSA-FACE) to select for clones with the appropriate N-glycosylation profile. The steps described in this chapter can be followed in an iterative fashion in order to generate clones of Pichia pastoris expressing heterologous proteins with humanized N-glycans.


Title #1530: Protein Production with a Pichia pastoris OCH1 Knockout Strain in Fed-Batch Mode.
PMID: 26082217
Authors: Christoph C. Gmeiner, Oliver O. Spadiut
Abstract: The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a widely used host organism for recombinant protein production in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. However, if the target product describes a glycoprotein, an Î±-1,6-mannosyltransferase located in the Golgi apparatus of P. pastoris, called OCH1, triggers hypermannosylation of the recombinant protein which significantly impedes following unit operations and hampers biopharmaceutical product applications. A knockout of the och1 gene allows the production of less-glycosylated proteins-however, morphology and physiology of P. pastoris also change, complicating the upstream process. Here, we describe a controlled and efficient bioprocess based on the specific substrate uptake rate (q s) for a recombinant P. pastoris OCH1 knockout strain expressing a peroxidase as model protein.


Title #1531: Progress in Yeast Glycosylation Engineering.
PMID: 26082216
Authors: Stephen R SR. Hamilton, Dongxing D. Zha
Abstract: While yeast are lower eukaryotic organisms, they share many common features and biological processes with higher eukaryotes. As such, yeasts have been used as model organisms to facilitate our understanding of such features and processes. To this end, a large number of powerful genetic tools have been developed to investigate and manipulate these organisms. Going hand-in-hand with these genetic tools is the ability to efficiently scale up the fermentation of these organisms, thus making them attractive hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. A key feature of producing recombinant proteins in yeast is that these proteins can be readily secreted into the culture supernatant, simplifying any downstream processing. A consequence of this secretion is that the proteins typically pass through the secretory pathway, during which they may be exposed to various posttranslational modifications. The addition of glycans is one such modification. Unfortunately, while certain aspects of glycosylation are shared between lower and higher eukaryotes, significant differences exist. Over the last two decades much research has focused on engineering the glycosylation pathways of yeast to more closely resemble those of higher eukaryotes, particularly those of humans for the production of therapeutic proteins. In the current review we shall highlight some of the key achievements in yeast glyco-engineering which have led to humanization of both the N- and O-linked glycosylation pathways.


Title #1532: Glyco-engineering O-Antigen-Based Vaccines and Diagnostics in E. coli.
PMID: 26082215
Authors: Nicolas F NF. Vozza, Mario F MF. Feldman
Abstract: The biotechnological relevance of protein glycosylation has exponentially grown in recent years. With the advances in protein glycosylation research, new possibilities for glyco-engineering have arisen, and a wide array of glycans can be designed and potentially transferred to target proteins in the biotechnologically relevant host Escherichia coli. Here we provide insight on how to select the best strains and plasmids. We also describe methods for determination of glycan expression and assembly, protein glycosylation using western blot, and preparation of samples for mass spectrometry.


Title #1533: Production of Glycoproteins with Asparagine-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine in Escherichia coli.
PMID: 26082214
Authors: Flavio F. Schwarz, Markus M. Aebi
Abstract: Glycans linked to asparagine (N) residues of eukaryotic glycoproteins are typically heterogeneous. This diversity complicates the study of biological functions associated with particular glycan structures and impairs the application of glycoproteins in medicine. Several approaches have been developed to produce homogeneous glycoproteins. We describe a method to produce glycoproteins carrying N-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) through glyco-engineered E. coli cells and enzymatic treatment. N-linked GlcNAc can then be extended by existing methods to produce homogeneous glycoproteins.


Title #1534: GlycoSNAP: A High-Throughput Screening Methodology for Engineering Designer Glycosylation Enzymes.
PMID: 26082213
Authors: Anne A AA. Ollis, Yi Y. Chai, Matthew P MP. DeLisa
Abstract: The Campylobacter jejuni protein glycosylation locus (pgl) encodes enzymes for asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation and serves as the prototype for N-glycosylation in bacteria. This pathway has been functionally transferred into Escherichia coli, thereby enabling efficient N-linked glycosylation of acceptor proteins with the C. jejuni heptasaccharide in this genetically tractable host. However, expansion of this bacterial system to encompass the vast biological diversity of potential glycans and target proteins often requires engineering of the non-native enzymes to isolate variants with optimal or altered functions. Here, we describe a genetic assay named glycoSNAP (glycosylation of secreted N-linked acceptor proteins) that facilitates engineering of glycosylation enzymes directly in E. coli. To date, this method has been successfully applied to screen (1) combinatorial libraries of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) for relaxed substrate specificity and (2) acceptor site libraries to identify sequons recognized by natural OSTs as well as engineered variants.


Title #1535: Inverse Metabolic Engineering for Enhanced Glycoprotein Production in Escherichia coli.
PMID: 26082212
Authors: Stephen R P SR. JaffÃ©, Benjamin B. Strutton, Jagroop J. Pandhal, Phillip C PC. Wright
Abstract: Inverse metabolic engineering (IME) provides a strategy to rapidly identify the genetic elements responsible for the desired phenotype of a chosen target organism. This methodology has been successfully applied towards enhancing the N-linked glycosylation efficiency of Escherichia coli. Here, we describe the generation of differentially sized libraries from the E. coli W3110 genome followed by high-throughput semiquantitative glycan specific screening. DNA sequenced targets demonstrating increased levels of glycan production were selected for forward engineering, protein overexpression, and absolute quantification of glycoproteins.


Title #1536: Current Approaches to Engineering N-Linked Protein Glycosylation in Bacteria.
PMID: 26082211
Authors: Andreas A. Naegeli, Markus M. Aebi
Abstract: N-Linked protein glycosylation is a common posttranslational protein modification in eukaryotes involved in many biological processes. As glycosylation is also important for the function and the pharmacokinetic properties of many protein therapeutics, there is an increasing interest in expression systems able to produce glycoproteins of well-defined structure. Bacterial expression hosts generally do not glycosylate proteins at all. However, the discovery of bacterial N-glycosylation systems has opened up a new route for the production of therapeutically interesting glycoproteins in glyco-engineered bacteria. This review offers an introduction to the many efforts taken to engineer bacteria in order to produce N-glycoproteins with defined eukaryotic glycan structures, completely novel protein glycoconjugates as well as to establish screening approaches for improvement and adaptation of the glycosylation machinery to specific applications.


Title #1537: Macromol. Rapid Commun. 12/2015.
PMID: 26082209
Authors: JoÃ£o J. AvÃ³, Susete N SN. Fernandes, Maria H MH. Godinho
Abstract: Back Cover: Cellulose-based electrospun fibers are fragmented by sonication-induced cavitation in water. The fragmentation process reveals a hierarchical structure of the electrospun structures, which are composed of closely-packed nanofilaments aligned along the fiber main axis. The limiting length of the electrospun filaments, which is reached after sonication, can be related to their mechanical properties allowing for the determination of a single fiber's tensile strength by using a high-volume statistical method developed by Terentjev et al. Further details can be found in the article by J. AvÃ³, S. N. Fernandes, and M. H. Godinho* on page 1166.

Abstract: Front Cover: Bilayer plastic films deposited with molecular azobenzene chromophores show fast and strong photomechanical response. Multi-beam irradiation of these films allows for unique curing capabilities, which can be used for photo-driven robot hands to precisely manipulate objects. This provides a new and simple strategy to freely tailor full-plastic photomechanical device possessing compound movements with battery-free and remote control.

Abstract: Perineural scar formation is responsible for pain and loss of function after surgical procedures. Neurolysis and application of anti-adhesion gels are required to restore a gliding surface. We tested a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) gel on mouse sciatic nerve to describe its safety and efficacy.

Authors: Lucy K M LK. Bain, Phyo K PK. Myint, Amy A. Jennings, Marleen A H MA. Lentjes, Robert N RN. Luben, Kay-Tee KT. Khaw, Nick J NJ. Wareham, Ailsa A AA. Welch
Abstract: Dietary magnesium could modify the major stroke risk factors, high blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol, but has been understudied in both sexes in a single population. This study aimed to investigate if dietary magnesium intake was associated with BP, total cholesterol (TC) and incident stroke risk in an adult population.


Title #1541: A randomised controlled trial of intravenous dexamethasone combined with interscalene brachial plexus blockade for shoulder surgery.
PMID: 26082203
Authors: M. M. Desmet, B. B. Vanneste, M. M. Reynvoet, J. J. Van Cauwelaert, L. L. Verhelst, H. H. Pottel, C. C. Missant, M. M. Van de Velde
Abstract: We recruited patients scheduled for shoulder rotator cuff repair or subacromial decompression under general anaesthesia and interscalene brachial plexus blockade (30Â ml ropivacaine 0.5%). We allocated 240 participants into four groups of 60 that were given pre-operative saline 0.9% or dexamethasone 1.25Â mg, 2.5Â mg or 10Â mg, intravenously. We recorded outcomes for 48Â h. The median (IQR [range]) time to first postoperative analgesic request after saline was 12.2 (11.0-14.1 [1.8-48])Â h, which was extended by intravenous dexamethasone 2.5Â mg and 10Â mg to 17.4 (14.9-21.5 [7.2-48])Â h, pÂ <Â 0.0001, and 20.1 (17.2-24.3 [1.3-48])Â h, pÂ <Â 0.0001, respectively, but not by dexamethasone 1.25Â mg, 14.0 (12.1-17.7 [2.1-48])Â h, pÂ =Â 0.05. Postoperative analgesia was given sooner after rotator cuff repair than subacromial decompression, hazard ratio (95% CI) 2.2 (1.6-3.0), pÂ <Â 0.0001, but later in older participants, hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.98 (0.97-0.99) per year, pÂ <Â 0.0001.


Title #1542: Knockdown of PKM2 induces apoptosis and autophagy in human A549 alveolar adenocarcinoma cells.
PMID: 26082202
Authors: Beibei B. Chu, Jiang J. Wang, Yueying Y. Wang, Guoyu G. Yang
Abstract: The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which has been identified as the predominant cause of the Warburg effect in cancer cells, is essential in tumor metabolism and growth. However, the role of PKM2 in autophagy remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy and apoptotic cell death in human A549 alveolar adenocarcinoma cells. Two short hairpin (sh)RNAs targeting human PKM2 mRNA were designed and lentiviral vectors were constructed. The A549 cells were infected with lentiviruses, containing shRNAs against PKM2, and the expression of PKM2 was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTâqPCR) and immonoblotting analysis. A lactose dehydrogenase (LDH)âcoupled enzyme assay was used to detect the pyruvate kinase activity. RTâqPCR was used to detect the mRNA expression level of glycolysisâassociated enzymes. The quantification of cells with punctate LC3 and expression of LC3II were examined to demonstrate autophagy. An MTT assay was used to detect cell viability and flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis. The activity of caspaseÂ 3/7 and the expression of Bclâ2 were also detected in A549 cells with PKM2 knockdown. The present study demonstrated that the two shRNAs efficiently downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of PKM2 in A549 cells. The knockdown of PKM2 decreased pyruvate kinase activity and glycolysis. Autophagy was induced in A549 cells with PKM2 knockdown. Inhibition of autophagy accelerated apoptotic death in PKM2âknockdown cells and this was dependent on increased caspase 3/7 activity and decreased expression of Bclâ2. In conclusion, the downregulation of PKM2 induced apoptosis and autophagy in A549 cells and this autophagy protected the cells from apoptotic cell death.


Title #1543: Urokinase receptor and CXCR4 are regulated by common microRNAs in leukaemia cells.
PMID: 26082201
Authors: Daniela D. Alfano, Anna A. Gorrasi, Anna A. Li Santi, Patrizia P. Ricci, Nunzia N. Montuori, Carmine C. Selleri, Pia P. Ragno
Abstract: The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (uPAR) focuses uPA proteolytic activity on the cell membrane, promoting localized degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and binds vitronectin (VN), mediating cell adhesion to the ECM. uPAR-bound uPA and VN induce proteolysis-independent intracellular signalling, regulating cell adhesion, migration, survival and proliferation. uPAR cross-talks with CXCR4, the receptor for the stroma-derived factor 1 chemokine. CXCR4 is crucial in the trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells from/to the bone marrow, which involves also uPAR. Both uPAR and CXCR4 are expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with a lower expression in undifferentiated and myeloid subsets, and higher expression in myelomonocytic and promyelocytic subsets. We hypothesized a microRNA (miR)-mediated co-regulation of uPAR and CXCR4 expression, which could allow their cross-talk at the cell surface. We identified three miRs, miR-146a, miR-335 and miR-622, regulating the expression of both uPAR and CXCR4 in AML cell lines. Indeed, these miRs directly target the 3'untranslated region of both uPAR- and CXCR4-mRNAs; accordingly, uPAR/CXCR4 expression is reduced by their overexpression in AML cells and increased by their specific inhibitors. Overexpression of all three miRs impairs migration, invasion and proliferation of myelomonocytic cells. Interestingly, we observed an inverse relationship between uPAR/CXCR4 expression and miR-146a and miR-335 levels in AML blasts, suggesting their possible role in the regulation of uPAR/CXCR4 expression also inÂ vivo.


Title #1544: High-density lipoprotein synthesis and metabolism (Review).
PMID: 26082200
Authors: Lingyan L. Zhou, Congcong C. Li, Ling L. Gao, Aihong A. Wang
Abstract: High density lipoproteins (HDL) are heterogeneous particles regarding their size and composition. They have vital functions in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). RCT occurs when lipid-free apolipoproteinÂ AI recruits cholesterol and phospholipid to form nascent HDL particles. Adenosine triphosphateâbinding cassette transporters and scavenger receptor classÂ B typeÂ I were found to be associated with the synthesis of HDL. Experimental studies have identified several potential antiâatherogenic effects of HDL, including promotion of macrophage cholesterol outflow as well as antiâinflammatory and antiâthrombotic effects. HDL can also transport microRNAs. This review mainly summarizes the present knowledge of HDL synthesis and metabolism.


Title #1545: Executive function deficits in congenital heart disease: why is intervention important?
PMID: 26082199
Authors: Johanna J. Calderon, David C DC. Bellinger
Abstract: It is widely recognised that children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder symptoms. Executive function impairments are one of the most prominent neurodevelopmental features associated with CHD. These deficits can have widespread debilitating repercussions in children's neurocognitive, behavioural, and psycho-social development. There is a crucial gap in research regarding the efficacy of preventive or treatment strategies for these important cognitive morbidities. Executive functions are complex neurocognitive skills highly amenable to improvement. Evidence-based interventions have shown promising results in other paediatric populations, strongly suggesting that they might also benefit the growing population of children with CHD. In this review, we summarise the available data on executive function impairments in children and adolescents with CHD. We underline the important co-morbidity of executive dysfunction with other cognitive and psychiatric issues in CHD, which raises awareness of the crucial need to prevent or at least mitigate these deficits. Finally, we summarise future avenues for research in terms of interventions that may help reduce executive function impairments in youth with CHD.


Title #1546: Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy with Cervical Anastomosis.
PMID: 26082198
Authors: Moshim M. Kukar, Steven N SN. Hochwald
Abstract: This video demonstrates our technique for a minimally invasive esophagectomy with side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. This technique is routinely utilized in most patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction malignancy, excluding type III gastroesophageal junction tumors. Absolute contraindications include significant tumor involvement of the fundus which may necessitate an intrathoracic anastomosis. Relative contraindications include poor pulmonary function or prior extensive surgical history that may either preclude surgery altogether or prevent the ability of the conduit from reaching the cervical region, or could preclude utilization of a minimally invasive approach. We have not found large body habitus to be an absolute contraindication for this approach. The technique involves thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus, laparoscopic dissection of the stomach and creation of gastric conduit, and creation of a 6Â cm side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The pylorus is treated with a botox injection; routine pyloroplasty is not performed. In our experience, this technique is safe, oncologically appropriate, and provides excellent functional results.


Title #1547: Early dynamic left intraventricular obstruction is associated with hypovolemia and high mortality in septic shock patients.

Abstract: Based on previously published case reports demonstrating dynamic left intraventricular obstruction (IVO) triggered by hypovolemia or catecholamines, this study aimed to establish: (1) its occurrence in septic-shock patients; (2) correlation between this intraventricular gradient (IVG) with volume status and fluid responsiveness; (3) mortality rate.


Title #1548: The mouse radial spoke protein 3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that promotes neurogenesis.
PMID: 26082196
Authors: Runchuan R. Yan, Xinde X. Hu, Wei W. Zhang, Lingzhen L. Song, Jiutao J. Wang, Yupeng Y. Yin, Shulin S. Chen, Shanting S. Zhao
Abstract: Radial spoke protein 3 (RSP3) was first identified in Chlamydomonas as a component of radial spoke, which is important for flagellar motility. The mammalian homolog of the Chlamydomonas RSP3 protein is found to be a mammalian protein kinase A-anchoring protein that binds ERK1/2. Here we show that mouse RSP3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. The full-length RSP3-EGFP fusion protein is mainly located in the cytoplasm of Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, by using deletion mutants of RSP3, we identified two nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal in RSP3. Moreover, using in utero electroporation, we found that overexpression of RSP3 in the developing cerebral cortex promotes neurogenesis. The layer II/III of the neocortex was much thicker in the RSP3-transfected region than that of the untransfected region in the neocortex. We also show that RSP3 is specifically located in the primary cilia of the radial glial cells, where it acts as a signaling mediator that regulates neurogenesis. Thus, our results suggest that RSP3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and plays an essential role in neurogenesis.


Title #1549: Peer Group Norms and Accountability Moderate the Effect of School Norms on Children's Intergroup Attitudes.
PMID: 26082195
Authors: Luke L. McGuire, Adam A. Rutland, Drew D. Nesdale
Abstract: The present study examined the interactive effects of school norms, peer norms, and accountability on children's intergroup attitudes. Participants (nÂ =Â 229) aged 5-11Â years, in a between-subjects design, were randomly assigned to a peer group with an inclusion or exclusion norm, learned their school either had an inclusion norm or not, and were accountable to either their peer group, teachers, or nobody. Findings indicated, irrespective of age, that an inclusive school norm was less effective when the peer group had an exclusive norm and children were held accountable to their peers or teachers. These findings support social identity development theory (D. Nesdale, 2004, 2007), which expects both the in-group peer and school norm to influence children's intergroup attitudes.


Title #1550: Assessment of endogenous reference gene suitability for serum exosomal microRNA expression analysis in liver carcinoma resection studies.
PMID: 26082194
Authors: Yi Y. Li, Gui-Ming GM. Xiang, Lin-Lin LL. Liu, Chang C. Liu, Fei F. Liu, Dong-Neng DN. Jiang, Xiao-Yun XY. Pu
Abstract: Serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have received considerable attention as potential biomarkers for tumor diagnosis. Reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTâqPCR) is commonly used to detect miRNA expression levels in various types of cancer. One prerequisite for valid RTâqPCR data is the correct normalization of miRNAs to stably expressed endogenous reference genes (RGs). The study of liver carcinoma resection requires the use of reliable RGs in order to assess the expression levels of serum exosomal target miRNAs. However, the assessment of RG suitability for optimum serum exosomal miRNA expression analysis has yet to be investigated. The present study investigated the expression stability of 10 candidate RGs. The candidate genes included eight miRNAs (miRâ16, miRâ103, miRâ191, letâ7a, miRâ26a, miRâ221, miRâ181a, and miRâ451) and two small RNAs (5S and U6). The stability values of the candidate genes were calculated using the following algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ÎCt method. The overall ranking obtained from these analyses revealed that miRâ221, letâ7a, and miRâ26a were appropriate internal RGs for analysis of serum miRNAs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, normalization with miRâ221 and letâ7a combined, as recommended by geNorm, or with miRâ26a, as recommended by NormFinder, increased the accuracy of interpretation of the target miRNA expression levels in hepatopathy studies.

Abstract: Our purpose was to determine whether vaginal hernia is a predisposing factor for incisional hernia (IH) in a cohort of women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) who underwent corrective repair by open mesh sacrocolpopexy (MSC) and had long-term follow-up to determine their rate of subsequent IH.


Title #1552: The Role of miR-21 in Cancer.
PMID: 26082192
Authors: Susan R SR. Pfeffer, Chuan He CH. Yang, Lawrence M LM. Pfeffer
Abstract: Preclinical Research MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the past decade, miRNAs have been extensively studied in a number of different human cancers. MiRNAs have been identified to act both as oncogenes and as tumor suppressors. In addition, miRNAs are associated with the intrinsic resistance of cancer to various forms of therapy, and they are implicated in both tumor progression and metastasis. The characterization of the specific alterations in the patterns of miRNA expression in cancer has great potential for identifying biomarkers for early cancer detection, as well as for potential therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment. In this chapter, we describe the ever-expanding role of miR-21 and its target genes in different cancers, and provide insight into how this oncogenic miRNA regulates cancer cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis by suppressing the expression of tumor suppressors.

Title #1554: Quantum-trajectory Monte Carlo method for study of electron-crystal interaction in STEM.
PMID: 26082190
Authors: Z. Z. Ruan, R G RG. Zeng, Y. Y. Ming, M. M. Zhang, B. B. Da, S F SF. Mao, Z J ZJ. Ding
Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum-trajectory Monte Carlo simulation method is developed to study electron beam interaction with a crystalline solid for application to electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The method combines the Bohmian quantum trajectory method, which treats electron elastic scattering and diffraction in a crystal, with a Monte Carlo sampling of electron inelastic scattering events along quantum trajectory paths. We study in this work the electron scattering and secondary electron generation process in crystals for a focused incident electron beam, leading to understanding of the imaging mechanism behind the atomic resolution secondary electron image that has been recently achieved in experiment with a scanning transmission electron microscope. According to this method, the Bohmian quantum trajectories have been calculated at first through a wave function obtained via a numerical solution of the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation with a multislice method. The impact parameter-dependent inner-shell excitation cross section then enables the Monte Carlo sampling of ionization events produced by incident electron trajectories travelling along atom columns for excitation of high energy knock-on secondary electrons. Following cascade production, transportation and emission processes of true secondary electrons of very low energies are traced by a conventional Monte Carlo simulation method to present image signals. Comparison of the simulated image for a Si(110) crystal with the experimental image indicates that the dominant mechanism of atomic resolution of secondary electron image is the inner-shell ionization events generated by a high-energy electron beam.


Title #1555: And-1 coordinates with Claspin for efficient Chk1 activation in response to replication stress.
PMID: 26082189
Authors: Jing J. Hao, Christelle C. de Renty, Yongming Y. Li, Haijie H. Xiao, Michael G MG. Kemp, Zhiyong Z. Han, Melvin L ML. DePamphilis, Wenge W. Zhu
Abstract: The replisome is important for DNA replication checkpoint activation, but how specific components of the replisome coordinate with ATR to activate Chk1 in human cells remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that And-1, a replisome component, acts together with ATR to activate Chk1. And-1 is phosphorylated at T826 by ATR following replication stress, and this phosphorylation is required for And-1 to accumulate at the damage sites, where And-1 promotes the interaction between Claspin and Chk1, thereby stimulating efficient Chk1 activation by ATR. Significantly, And-1 binds directly to ssDNA and facilitates the association of Claspin with ssDNA. Furthermore, And-1 associates with replication forks and is required for the recovery of stalled forks. These studies establish a novel ATR-And-1 axis as an important regulator for efficient Chk1 activation and reveal a novel mechanism of how the replisome regulates the replication checkpoint and genomic stability.


Title #1556: Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-Î± Inhibition Protects Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Mice.

Abstract: Doxorubicin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug against a considerable number of malignancies. However, its toxic effects on myocardium are confirmed as major limit of utilization. PPAR-Î± is highly expressed in the heart, and its activation leads to an increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation and cardiomyocyte necrosis. This study was performed to adjust the hypothesis that PPAR-Î± receptor inhibition protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Male Balb/c mice were used in this study. Left atria were isolated, and their contractility was measured in response to electrical field stimulation in a standard organ bath. PPAR-Î± activity was measured using specific PPAR-Î± antibody in an ELISA-based system coated with double-strand DNA containing PPAR-Î± response element sequence. Moreover, cardiac MDA and TNF-Î± levels were measured by ELISA method. Following incubation with doxorubicin (35Â ÂµM), a significant reduction in atrial contractility was observed (PÂ <Â 0.001). Pretreatment of animals with a selective PPAR-Î± antagonist, GW6471, significantly improved doxorubicin-induced atrial dysfunction (PÂ <Â 0.001). Furthermore, pretreatment of the mice with a non-selective cannabinoid agonist, WIN55212-2, significantly decreased PPAR-Î± activity in cardiac tissue, subsequently leading to significant improvement in doxorubicin-induced atrial dysfunction (PÂ <Â 0.001). Also, GW6471 and WIN significantly reduced cardiac MDA and TNF-Î± levels compared with animals receiving doxorubicin (PÂ <Â 0.001). The study showed that inhibition of PPAR-Î± is associated with protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice, and cannabinoids can potentiate the protection by PPAR-Î± blockade. Moreover, PPAR-Î± may be considered as a target to prevent cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in patients undergoing chemotherapy.


Title #1557: Fluorescent nanodiamonds as a relevant tag for the assessment of alum adjuvant particle biodisposition.

Abstract: Aluminum oxyhydroxide (alum) is a crystalline compound widely used as an immunologic adjuvant of vaccines. Concerns linked to alum particles have emerged following recognition of their causative role in the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis, revealing an unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence of alum within immune cells and a fundamental misconception of its biodisposition. Evidence that aluminum-coated particles phagocytozed in the injected muscle and its draining lymph nodes can disseminate within phagocytes throughout the body and slowly accumulate in the brain further suggested that alum safety should be evaluated in the long term. However, lack of specific staining makes difficult the assessment of low quantities of bona fide alum adjuvant particles in tissues.


Title #1558: Photonic sensing of organic solvents through geometric study of dynamic reflection spectrum.
PMID: 26082186
Authors: Yuqi Y. Zhang, Qianqian Q. Fu, Jianping J. Ge
Abstract: Traditional photonic sensing based on the change of balanced reflection of photonic structures can hardly distinguish chemical species with similar refractive indices. Here a sensing method based on the dynamic reflection spectra (DRS) of photonic crystal gel has been developed to distinguish even homologues, isomers and solvents with similar structures and physical properties. There are inherent relationships between solvent properties, diffusion behaviour and evolution of reflection signals, so that the geometric characteristics of DRS pattern including ascending/descending, colour changes, splitting/merging and curvature of reflection band can be utilized to recognize different organic solvents. With adequate solvents being tested, a database of DRS patterns can be established, which provide a standard to identify an unknown solvent.

Abstract: Objective of this research was to evaluate adsorption of heavy metals in mono and multimetal forms onto sesame straw biochar (SSB). Competitive sorption of metals by SSB has never been reported previously. The maximum adsorption capacities (mgg(-1)) of metals by SSB were in the order of Pb (102)â«Cd (86)â«Cr (65)>Cu (55)â«Zn (34) in the monometal adsorption isotherm and Pb (88)â«Cu (40)â«Cr (21)>Zn (7)â©¾Cd (5) in the multimetal adsorption isotherm. Based on data obtained from the distribution coefficients, Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models, and three-dimensional simulation, multimetal adsorption behaviors differed from monometal adsorption due to competition. Especially, during multimetal adsorption, Cd was easily exchanged and substituted by other metals. Further competitive adsorption studies are necessary in order to accurately estimate the heavy metal adsorption capacity of biochar in natural environments.


Title #1561: Functional roles of connexins and pannexins in the kidney.
PMID: 26082183
Authors: Ahmed B AB. Abed, Panagiotis P. Kavvadas, Christos E CE. Chadjichristos
Abstract: Kidneys are highly complex organs, playing a crucial role in human physiopathology, as they are implicated in vital processes, such as fluid filtration and vasomotor tone regulation. There is growing evidence that gap junctions are major determinants of renal physiopathology. It has been demonstrated that their expression or channel activity may vary depending on physiological and pathological situations within distinct renal compartments. While some studies have focused on the role of connexins in renal physiology, our knowledge regarding the functional relevance of pannexins is still very limited. In this paper, we provide an overview of the involvement of connexins, pannexins and their channels in various physiological processes related to different renal compartments.


Title #1562: Mechanisms for exporting large-sized cargoes from the endoplasmic reticulum.
PMID: 26082182
Authors: Kota K. Saito, Toshiaki T. Katada
Abstract: Cargo proteins exported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus are typically transported in coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles of 60-90Â nm diameter. Several cargo molecules including collagens and chylomicrons form structures that are too large to be accommodated by these vesicles, but their secretion still requires COPII proteins. Here, we first review recent progress on large cargo secretions derived especially from animal models and human diseases, which indicate the importance of COPII proteins. We then discuss the recent isolation of specialized factors that modulate the process of COPII-dependent cargo formation to facilitate the exit of large-sized cargoes from the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on these findings, we propose a model that describes the importance of the GTPase cycle for secretion of oversized cargoes. Next, we summarize reports that describe the structures of COPII proteins and how these results provide insight into the mechanism of assembly of the large cargo carriers. Finally, we discuss what issues remain to be solved in the future.

Abstract: Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and related genetic elements form 504 distinct families and occupy ~8Â % of human genome. Recent success of high-throughput experimental technologies facilitated understanding functional impact of HERVs for molecular machinery of human cells. HERVs encode active retroviral proteins, which may exert important physiological functions in the body, but also may be involved in the progression of cancer and numerous human autoimmune, neurological and infectious diseases. The spectrum of related malignancies includes, but not limits to, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, lupus, schizophrenia, multiple cancer types and HIV. In addition, HERVs regulate expression of the neighboring host genes and modify genomic regulatory landscape, e.g., by providing regulatory modules like transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Indeed, recent bioinformatic profiling identified ~110,000 regulatory active HERV elements, which formed at least ~320,000 human TFBS. These and other peculiarities of HERVs might have played an important role in human evolution and speciation. In this paper, we focus on the current progress in understanding of normal and pathological molecular niches of HERVs, on their implications in human evolution, normal physiology and disease. We also review the available databases dealing with various aspects of HERV genetics.

Title #1568: Endotracheal intubation in the ICU.
PMID: 26082175
Authors: Stephen E SE. Lapinsky
Abstract: Endotracheal intubation in the ICU is a high-risk procedure, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Up to 40% of cases are associated with marked hypoxemia or hypotension. The ICU patient is physiologically very different from the usual patient who undergoes intubation in the operating room, and different intubation techniques should be considered. The common operating room practice of sedation and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate intubation may carry significant risk in the ICU patient with a marked oxygenation abnormality, particularly when performed by the non-expert. Preoxygenation is largely ineffective in these patients and oxygen desaturation occurs rapidly on induction of anesthesia, limiting the time available to secure the airway. The ICU environment is less favorable for complex airway management than the operating room, given the frequent lack of availability of additional equipment or additional expert staff. ICU intubations are frequently carried out by trainees, with a lesser degree of airway experience. Even in the presence of a non-concerning airway assessment, these patients are optimally managed as a difficult airway, utilizing an awake approach. Endotracheal intubation may be achieved by awake direct laryngoscopy in the sick ICU patient whose level of consciousness may be reduced by sepsis, hypercapnia or hypoxemia. As the patient's spontaneous respiratory efforts are not depressed by the administration of drugs, additional time is available to obtain equipment and expertise in the event of failure to secure the airway. ICU intubation complications should be tracked as part of the ICU quality improvement process.


Title #1569: Disruption of Proline Synthesis in Melanoma Inhibits Protein Production Mediated by the GCN2 Pathway.
PMID: 26082174
Authors: Gregory R GR. Kardos, Hannah C HC. Wastyk, Gavin P GP. Robertson
Abstract: Many processes are deregulated in melanoma cells and one of those is protein production. While much is known about protein synthesis in cancer cells, effective ways of therapeutically targeting this process remains an understudied area of research. A process that is upregulated in melanoma compared to normal melanocytes is proline biosynthesis, which has been linked to both oncogene and tumor suppressor pathways, suggesting an important convergent point for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, a RNA interference (RNAi) screen of a kinase library was undertaken, identifying aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1 (ALDH18A1) as a critically important gene in regulating melanoma cell growth through proline biosynthesis. Inhibition of ALDH18A1, the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), significantly decreased cultured melanoma cell viability and tumor growth. Knockdown of P5CS using siRNA had no effect on apoptosis, autophagy, or the cell cycle but cell doubling time increased dramatically suggesting that there was a general slowdown in cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, targeting ALDH18A1 activated the serine/threonine protein kinase GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) to inhibit protein synthesis, which could be reversed with proline supplementation. Thus, targeting ALDH18A1 in melanoma can be used to disrupt proline biosynthesis to limit cell metabolism thereby increasing the cellular doubling time mediated through the GCN2 pathway.


Title #1570: Systematic Screening of Promoter Regions Pinpoints Functional Cis-regulatory Mutations in a Cutaneous Melanoma Genome.

Abstract: With the recent discovery of recurrent mutations in the TERT promoter in melanoma, identification of other somatic causal promoter mutations is of considerable interest. Yet, the impact of sequence variation on the regulatory potential of gene promoters has not been systematically evaluated. This study assesses the impact of promoter mutations on promoter activity in the whole-genome sequenced malignant melanoma cell line COLO-829. Combining somatic mutation calls from COLO-829 with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and histone modification data revealed mutations within promoter elements. Interestingly, a high number of potential promoter mutations (n=23) were found, a result mirrored in subsequent analysis of TCGA whole-melanoma genomes. The impact of wildtype and mutant promoter sequences were evaluated by sub-cloning into luciferase reporter vectors and testing their transcriptional activity in COLO-829 cells. Of the 23 promoter regions tested, four mutations significantly altered reporter activity relative to wild-type sequences. These data were then subjected to multiple computational algorithms that score the cis-regulatory altering potential of mutations. These analyses identified one mutation, located within the promoter region of NDUFB9, which encodes the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 9, to be recurrent in 4.4% (19/432) of TCGA whole-melanoma exomes. The mutation is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved SP1/KLF transcription factor binding motif and its frequent co-occurrence with mutations in the coding sequence of NF1 supports a pathological role for this mutation in melanoma. Taken together, these data show the relatively high prevalence of promoter mutations in the COLO-829 melanoma genome, and indicates that a proportion of these significantly alter the regulatory potential of gene promoters.


Title #1571: LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.
PMID: 26082172
Authors: Lei L. Hua, Diane R DR. Wang, Lubin L. Tan, Yongcai Y. Fu, Fengxia F. Liu, Langtao L. Xiao, Zuofeng Z. Zhu, Qiang Q. Fu, Xianyou X. Sun, Ping P. Gu, Hongwei H. Cai, Susan R SR. McCouch, Chuanqing C. Sun
Abstract: Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the wild relative of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), flaunts long, barbed awns, which are necessary for efficient propagation and dissemination of seeds. By contrast, O. sativa cultivars have been selected to be awnless or to harbor short, barbless awns, which facilitate seed processing and storage. The transition from long, barbed awns to short, barbless awns was a crucial event in rice domestication. Here, we show that the presence of long, barbed awns in wild rice is controlled by a major gene on chromosome 4, LONG AND BARBED AWN1 (LABA1), which encodes a cytokinin-activating enzyme. A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation. Sequencing analysis demonstrated low nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep encompassing an â¼800-kb region around the derived laba1 allele in cultivated rice. Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication. Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development.

Title #1573: Microbial bioinformatics for food safety and production.
PMID: 26082168
Authors: Wynand W. Alkema, Jos J. Boekhorst, Michiel M. Wels, Sacha A F T SA. van Hijum
Abstract: In the production of fermented foods, microbes play an important role. Optimization of fermentation processes or starter culture production traditionally was a trial-and-error approach inspired by expert knowledge of the fermentation process. Current developments in high-throughput 'omics' technologies allow developing more rational approaches to improve fermentation processes both from the food functionality as well as from the food safety perspective. Here, the authors thematically review typical bioinformatics techniques and approaches to improve various aspects of the microbial production of fermented food products and food safety.


Title #1574: Value of exercise echocardiography in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a substudy from the KaRen study.
PMID: 26082167
Authors: Erwan E. Donal, Lars H LH. Lund, Emmanuel E. Oger, AmÃ©lie A. Reynaud, FrÃ©dÃ©ric F. Schnell, Hans H. Persson, Elodie E. Drouet, Cecilia C. Linde, Claude C. Daubert, 
Abstract: KaRen is a multicentre study designed to characterize and follow patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In a subgroup of patients with clinical signs of congestion but left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >45%, we sought to describe and analyse the potential prognostic value of echocardiographic parameters recorded not only at rest but also during a submaximal exercise stress echocardiography. Exercise-induced changes in echo parameters might improve our ability to characterize HFpEF patients.


Title #1575: Virus Genotype Distribution and Virus Burden in Children and Adults Hospitalized for Norovirus Gastroenteritis, 2012-2014, Hong Kong.
PMID: 26082165

Abstract: We conducted a 2-year hospital-based study on norovirus gastroenteritis among children and adults between August 2012 and September 2014. A total of 1,146 norovirus cases were identified. Young children (agedââ¤â5 years) accounted for a majority (53.3%) of cases. Hospitalization incidence exhibited a U-shaped pattern with the highest rate in young children (1,475 per 100,000 person-years), followed by the elderly agedâ>â84 years (581 per 100,000 person-years). A subset (nâ=â395, 34.5%) of cases were selected for norovirus genotyping and noroviral load measurement. Non-GII.4 infections were more commonly observed in young children than in older adults (agedâ>â65 years) (20.5% versus 9.2%; pâ<â0.05). In young children, the median noroviral load of GII.4 and non-GII.4 cases was indistinguishably high (cycle threshold value, median [interquartile range]: 16.6 [15.2-19.3] versus 16.6 [14.9-21.6]; pâ=â0.45). Two age-specific non-GII.4 genotypes (GII.3 and GII.6) were identified among young children. These findings may have implications in norovirus vaccination strategy.


Title #1576: Ultraclean and large-area monolayer hexagonal boron nitride on Cu foil using chemical vapor deposition.
PMID: 26082164
Authors: Yao Y. Wen, Xunzhong X. Shang, Ji J. Dong, Kai K. Xu, Jun J. He, Chao C. Jiang
Abstract: Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been demonstrated to be an excellent dielectric layer as well as an ideal van der Waals epitaxial substrate for fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) atomic layers and their vertical heterostructures. Although many groups have obtained large-scale monolayer h-BN through low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), it is still a challenge to grow clean monolayers without the reduction of domain size. Here we report the synthesis of large-area (4Â ÃÂ 2 cm(2)) high quality monolayer h-BN with an ultraclean and unbroken surface on copper foil by using LPCVD. A detailed investigation of the key factors affecting growth and transfer of the monolayer was carried out in order to eliminate the adverse effects of impurity particles. Furthermore, an optimized transfer approach allowed the nondestructive and clean transfer of the monolayer from copper foil onto an arbitrary substrate, including a flexible substrate, under mild conditions. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the monolayer h-BN on SiO2 was less than 0.269 nm for areas with fewer wrinkles. Selective area electron diffraction analysis of the h-BN revealed a pattern of hexagonal diffraction spots, which unambiguously demonstrated its highly crystalline character. Our work paves the way toward the use of ultraclean and large-area monolayer h-BN as the dielectric layer in the fabrication of high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices for novel 2D atomic layer materials.

Title #1579: Improved understanding of rice amylose biosynthesis from advanced starch structural characterization.
PMID: 26082161
Authors: Enpeng E. Li, Alex Chi AC. Wu, Juan J. Li, Qiaoquan Q. Liu, Robert G RG. Gilbert
Abstract: It has been shown from the chain length distributions (CLDs) that amylose chains can be divided into at least two groups: long and short amylose chains. These molecular structures influence some functional properties of starch, such as digestibility and mouth-feel. GBSSI is the key enzyme for the elongation of amylose chains; however, the effect of other starch biosynthesis enzymes in amylose synthesis is still not fully understood. Two advanced starch characterization techniques, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorophore-assissted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), together with a newly developed starch biosynthesis model, are used to improve understanding of amylose biosynthesis.


Title #1580: Knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in Indian Anopheles culicifacies populations.
PMID: 26082160
Authors: Cherry L CL. Dykes, Raja Babu S RB. Kushwah, Manoj K MK. Das, Shri N SN. Sharma, Rajendra M RM. Bhatt, Vijay V. Veer, Om P OP. Agrawal, Tridibes T. Adak, Om P OP. Singh
Abstract: Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the primary vectors of malaria in India responsible for the highest number of malaria cases. This vector is resistant to DDT in most parts of the country with indication of emerging resistance to pyrethroids. Since knockdown resistance (kdr) is known to confer cross-resistance between DDT and pyrethroids owing to a common target site of action, knowledge of prevalence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles is important from insecticide resistance management point of view.


Title #1581: A Doubletime Nuclear Localization Signal Mediates an Interaction with Bride of Doubletime to Promote Circadian Function.
PMID: 26082158
Authors: Anandakrishnan A. Venkatesan, Jin-Yuan JY. Fan, Christopher C. Nauman, Jeffrey L JL. Price
Abstract: Doubletime (DBT) has an essential circadian role in Drosophila melanogaster because it phosphorylates Period (PER). To determine if DBT antagonism can produce distinct effects in the cytosol and nucleus, forms of a dominant negative DBT(K/R) with these 2 alternative localizations were produced. DBT has a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS), and mutation of this signal confers cytosolic localization of DBT in the lateral neurons of Drosophila clock cells in the brain. By contrast, addition of a strong NLS domain (e.g., SV40 NLS) to DBT's C terminus leads to more nuclear localization. Expression of DBT(K/R) with the mutated NLS (DBT(K/R) NLS(-)) using a timGAL4 driver does not alter the circadian period of locomotor activity, and the daily oscillations of PER detected by immunoblot and immunofluorescence persist, like those of wild-type flies. By contrast, expression of DBT(K/R) with the strong NLS (DBT(K/R) stNLS) using the timGAL4 driver lengthens period more strongly than DBT(K/R), with damped oscillations of PER phosphorylation and localization. Both DBT(K/R) and DBT(WT) without the NLS fail to interact with Bride of Doubletime (BDBT) protein, which is related to FK506-binding proteins and shown to interact with DBT to enhance its circadian function. This result suggests that the DBT(K/R) NLS(-) has lost its dominant negative property because it does not form normal clock protein complexes. DBT(WT) proteins with the same changes (NLS(-) and stNLS) also produce equivalent changes in localization that do not produce opposite period phenotypes. Additionally, a DBT(K/R) protein with both the stNLS and NLS(-) mutation does not affect circadian period, although it is nuclear, demonstrating that the lack of a dominant negative for the DBT(K/R) NLS(-) is not due to failure to localize to nuclei. Finally, bdbt RNAi increases the cytosolic localization of DBT(K/R) but not of DBT(WT), suggesting a role for BDBT in DBT kinase-dependent nuclear localization of DBT.

Title #1584: Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia): a possible therapeutic candidate against Blastocystis sp.
PMID: 26082155
Authors: Sonal S. Girish, Suresh S. Kumar, Norhaniza N. Aminudin
Abstract: In the local Malaysian context, herbal plants such as Eurycoma longifolia (Tongkat Ali), Orthosiphon stamineus (MisaiKucing), Ficus deltoidea (Mas Cotek), Zingiber officinale (Halia Bara) and Barringtonia racemosa (Putat) are known and widely used for its therapeutic properties. The first part of this study aims to screen for the anti-protozoal activity of these herbal plant extracts against Blastocystis sp. isolate subtype (ST) 3. Herbal extract with the highest efficacy was further fractionized into water and ethyl acetate fractions and tested against ST1, ST3 and ST5 Blastocystis sp. isolates. These isolates were also exposed to allopathic drugs, Metronidazole (MTZ), Tinidazole, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(TMP-SMX), Ketoconazole and Nitazoxanide for comparison purpose.


Title #1585: Can the sustainable development goals reduce the burden of nutrition-related non-communicable diseases without truly addressing major food system reforms?
PMID: 26082154
Authors: Corinna C. Hawkes, Barry M BM. Popkin
Abstract: While the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs; 2000-2015) focused primarily on poverty reduction, hunger and infectious diseases, the proposed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets pay more attention to nutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). One of the 169 proposed targets of the SDGs is to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one third; another is to end malnutrition in all its forms. Nutrition-related NCDs (NR-NCDs) stand at the intersection between malnutrition and NCDs. Driven in large part by remarkable transformations of food systems, they are rapidly increasing in most low and middle income countries (LMICs). The transformation to modern food systems began in the period following World War II with policies designed to meet a very different set of nutritional and food needs, and continued with globalization in the 1990s onwards. Another type of food systems transformation will be needed to shift towards a healthier and more sustainable diet - as will meeting many of the other SDGs. The process will be complex but is necessary. Communities concerned with NCDs and with malnutrition need to work more closely together to demand food systems change.


Title #1586: Cross-Linguistic Lexical, Grammatical, and Discourse Performance on Oral Narrative Retells Among Young Spanish Speakers.
PMID: 26082153
Authors: Audrey A. Lucero
Abstract: This study investigated relations among microlevel and macrolevel domains of oral narrative retells within and across the languages of Spanish-speaking bilingual children. Fifty-six first and second graders (Mage Â =Â 7Â years, 3Â months) were assessed on a retell task in Spanish and English. Two statistical analyses were conducted: (a) correlations within and across microlevel lexical (number of different words) and grammatical (mean length of utterance-word and subordination index) domains and (b) hierarchical regression to determine the influence of microlevel domains on a macrolevel discourse score. Results highlighted a number of significant within- and cross-language correlations, and identified vocabulary as a significant predictor of macrolevel discourse scores within both languages, while grammar was a predictor within English only.


Title #1587: Self-trained perception need not be veridical: striking can exaggerate judgment by wielding and can transfer exaggeration to new stimuli.
PMID: 26082152
Authors: Damian G DG. Kelty-Stephen, Charles L CL. Eddy
Abstract: Previous literature on self-training dynamic touch suggested that haptic judgments of length following wielding might benefit from new information through participants' own striking actions with the same stimuli. However, the conclusion that this self-training tended towards a veridical outcome of zero discrepancy between actual length and judged length was premature. In this replication, we allowed adult participants (n = 15) to strike on each trial and changed the stimuli in mid-experiment to determine whether striking helped participants build more accurate perceptions of length transferrable from one stimulus scale to another. We predicted that, if self-training led to better length judgments, the repeated striking would improve judgments and that, in turn, judgments following the switch of stimuli would show a good transfer of what participants had learned. On the other hand, self-training may simply exaggerate inertial properties of stimuli and may be sensitive to sudden changes in the scale of stimuli. Mixed-effect modeling of discrepancies show that striking only accentuated effects of inertial moment, producing exaggerated length judgments. Correlation between perceived length and actual length increased only for participants who experienced a switch in individual stimuli but not stimulus scale. We discuss the implications of these findings for any theoretical relationship between self-organization and veridicality.


Title #1588: Time-order errors and standard-position effects in duration discrimination: An experimental study and an analysis by the sensation-weighting model.
PMID: 26082151
Authors: Ãke Ã. HellstrÃ¶m, Thomas H TH. Rammsayer
Abstract: Studies have shown that the discriminability of successive time intervals depends on the presentation order of the standard (St) and the comparison (Co) stimuli. Also, this order affects the point of subjective equality. The first effect is here called the standard-position effect (SPE); the latter is known as the time-order error. In the present study, we investigated how these two effects vary across interval types and standard durations, using HellstrÃ¶m's sensation-weighting model to describe the results and relate them to stimulus comparison mechanisms. In Experimentâ1, four modes of interval presentation were used, factorially combining interval type (filled, empty) and sensory modality (auditory, visual). For each mode, two presentation orders (St-Co, Co-St) and two standard durations (100Â ms, 1,000Â ms) were used; half of the participants received correctness feedback, and half of them did not. The interstimulus interval was 900Â ms. The SPEs were negative (i.e., a smaller difference limen for St-Co than for Co-St), except for the filled-auditory and empty-visual 100-ms standards, for which a positive effect was obtained. In Experimentâ2, duration discrimination was investigated for filled auditory intervals with four standards between 100 and 1,000Â ms, an interstimulus interval of 900Â ms, and no feedback. Standard duration interacted with presentation order, here yielding SPEs that were negative for standards of 100 and 1,000Â ms, but positive for 215 and 464Â ms. Our findings indicate that the SPE can be positive as well as negative, depending on the interval type and standard duration, reflecting the relative weighting of the stimulus information, as is described by the sensation-weighting model.


Title #1589: Gender identification from high-pass filtered vowel segments: The use of high-frequency energy.
PMID: 26082150
Authors: Jeremy J JJ. Donai, Norman J NJ. Lass
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of high-frequency information for making gender identity judgments from high-pass filtered vowel segments produced by adult speakers. Specifically, the effect of removing lower-frequency spectral detail (i.e., F3 and below) from vowel segments via high-pass filtering was evaluated. Thirty listeners (ages 18-35) with normal hearing participated in the experiment. A within-subjects design was used to measure gender identification for six 250-ms vowel segments (/Ã¦/, /Éª /, /É/, /Ê/, /É/, and /u/), produced by ten male and ten female speakers. The results of this experiment demonstrated that despite the removal of low-frequency spectral detail, the listeners were accurate in identifying speaker gender from the vowel segments, and did so with performance significantly above chance. The removal of low-frequency spectral detail reduced gender identification by approximately 16Â % relative to unfiltered vowel segments. Classification results using linear discriminant function analyses followed the perceptual data, using spectral and temporal representations derived from the high-pass filtered segments. Cumulatively, these findings indicate that normal-hearing listeners are able to make accurate perceptual judgments regarding speaker gender from vowel segments with low-frequency spectral detail removed via high-pass filtering. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest the presence of perceptual cues related to gender identity in the high-frequency region of naturally produced vowel signals. Implications of these findings and possible mechanisms for performing the gender identification task from high-pass filtered stimuli are discussed.


Title #1590: Spatiotemporal prediction of fine particulate matter using high-resolution satellite images in the Southeastern US 2003-2011.

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5âÎ¼m in aerodynamic diameter) is associated with adverse health outcomes. The use of ground monitoring stations of PM2.5 to assess personal exposure, however, induces measurement error. Land-use regression provides spatially resolved predictions but land-use terms do not vary temporally. Meanwhile, the advent of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have made possible to predict the spatial and temporal patterns of PM2.5 exposures. In this paper, we used AOD data with other PM2.5 variables, such as meteorological variables, land-use regression, and spatial smoothing to predict daily concentrations of PM2.5 at a 1-km(2) resolution of the Southeastern United States including the seven states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida for the years from 2003 to 2011. We divided the study area into three regions and applied separate mixed-effect models to calibrate AOD using ground PM2.5 measurements and other spatiotemporal predictors. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained out of sample R(2) values of 0.77, 0.81, and 0.70 with the square root of the mean squared prediction errors of 2.89, 2.51, and 2.82âÎ¼g/m(3) for regions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The slopes of the relationships between predicted PM2.5 and held out measurements were approximately 1 indicating no bias between the observed and modeled PM2.5 concentrations. Predictions can be used in epidemiological studies investigating the effects of both acute and chronic exposures to PM2.5. Our model results will also extend the existing studies on PM2.5 which have mostly focused on urban areas because of the paucity of monitors in rural areas.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jes.2015.41.

Title #1592: An analysis of near misses identified by anesthesia providers in the intensive care unit.
PMID: 26082147
Authors: Angela K M AK. Lipshutz, James E JE. Caldwell, David L DL. Robinowitz, Michael A MA. Gropper
Abstract: Learning from adverse events and near misses may reduce the incidence of preventable errors. Current literature on adverse events and near misses in the ICU focuses on errors reported by nurses and intensivists. ICU near misses identified by anesthesia providers may reveal critical events, causal mechanisms and system weaknesses not identified by other providers, and may differ in character and causality from near misses in other anesthesia locations.


Title #1593: Premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy in children.
PMID: 26082146
Authors: Zebulon Z ZZ. Spector, Stephen P SP. Seslar
Abstract: Adults with high premature ventricular contraction burden can develop left ventricular dilation, dysfunction, and strain, consistent with a cardiomyopathy, which is reversible with radiofrequency ablation of the premature ventricular contractions. Evidence in children with similar ectopy burden is limited. We performed a single-centre retrospective review to examine the prevalence of premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy, natural history of ventricular ectopy, and progression to ventricular tachycardia in children with frequent premature ventricular contractions.


Title #1594: Use of contrast media in diagnostic imaging: medico-legal considerations.
PMID: 26082145
Authors: C. C. Pomara, N. N. Pascale, F. F. Maglietta, M. M. Neri, I. I. Riezzo, E. E. Turillazzi
Abstract: Contrast media (CM) are used in imaging techniques to enhance the differences between body tissues on images. The ideal contrast medium should achieve very high concentration in the tissues without producing any adverse effects. Unfortunately, this has not been possible so far and all CM have adverse effects. The increasing use of CM is likely to give rise to a wide range of pitfalls, including compliance with and appropriateness of indications for the use of CM themselves, the choice of the 'best' contrast agent, off-label use, evaluation of special populations of patients, and competence to tackle emergency scenarios following the administration of CM. Even more prominent, and potentially more important, is the issue of informed consent which brings with it a duty to inform patients awaiting the administration of CM with regard to the nature of the procedure, the existence of alternative procedures, the extent of the risks relating to the use of CM and, finally, the risks relating to refusal of the procedure. All these issues may give rise to concerns about liability for failure to offer adequate information to patients or to carefully evaluate and balance the potential risks and benefits of the procedure or, finally, for being unprepared in the event of adverse reactions to CM, especially when these are severe and life-threatening. Educational and training programmes for radiologists are likely to shape change in the medical liability environment in the coming years.


Title #1595: Identification of conserved hepatic transcriptomic responses to 17Î²-estradiol using high-throughput sequencing in brown trout.
PMID: 26082144
Authors: Tamsyn M TM. Uren Webster, Janice A JA. Shears, Karen K. Moore, Eduarda M EM. Santos
Abstract: Estrogenic chemicals are major contaminants of surface waters and can threaten the sustainability of natural fish populations. Characterisation of the global molecular mechanisms of toxicity of environmental contaminants has been conducted primarily in model species rather than species with limited existing transcriptomic or genomic sequence information. We aimed to investigate the global mechanisms of toxicity of an endocrine disrupting chemical of environmental concern (17Î²-estradiol; E2) using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in an environmentally-relevant species, brown trout (Salmo trutta). We exposed mature males to measured concentrations of 1.94, 18.06 and 34.38 ng E2/L for four days and sequenced three individual liver samples per treatment using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Exposure to 34.4 ng E2/L resulted in 2113 differentially-regulated transcripts (FDR<0.05). Functional analysis revealed up-regulation of processes associated with vitellogenesis, including lipid metabolism, cellular proliferation and ribosome biogenesis, together with a down regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Using RT-QPCR, we validated the expression of eight target genes, and identified significant differences in the regulation of several known estrogen-responsive transcripts in fish exposed to the lower treatment concentrations (including esr1 and zp2.5). We successfully used RNA-seq to identify highly conserved responses to estrogen, and also identified some estrogen-responsive transcripts which have been less well characterised, including nots and tgm2l. These results demonstrate the potential application of RNA-seq as a valuable tool for assessing mechanistic effects of pollutants in ecologically-relevant species for which little genomic information is available.


Title #1596: Transcriptomic analysis of cyclic AMP response in bovine cumulus cells.
PMID: 26082143
Authors: Daulat Raheem DR. Khan, Christine C. Guillemette, Marc-AndrÃ© MA. Sirard, Francois J FJ. Richard
Abstract: Acquisition of oocyte developmental competence needs to be understood to improve clinical outcomes of assisted reproduction. The stimulation of cumulus cell concentration of cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) by pharmacological agents during in vitro maturation (IVM) participates in improvement of oocyte quality. However, precise coordination and downstream targets of cAMP signalling in cumulus cells are largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated better embryo development after cAMP stimulation for first 6 hrs during IVM. Using this model, we investigated cAMP signalling in cumulus cells through in vitro culture of cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) in the presence of cAMP raising agents: forskolin, IBMX and dipyridamole (here called FID treatment). Transcriptomic analysis of cumulus cells indicated that FID-induced differentially expressed transcripts were implicated in cumulus expansion, steroidogenesis, cell metabolism and oocyte competence. Functional genomic analysis revealed that protein kinase-A (PKA), extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and calcium (Ca(++)) pathways as key regulators of FID signalling. Inhibition of PKA (H89) in FID-supplemented COCs or substitution of FID with calcium ionophore (A23187) demonstrated that FID activated primarily the PKA pathway which inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and was upstream of calcium signalling. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by FID supported a regulation by dual specific phosphatase (DUSP1) via PKA. Our findings imply that cAMP (FID) regulates cell metabolism, steroidogenesis, intracellular signalling and cumulus expansion through PKA which modulates these functions through optimisation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and coordination of calcium signalling. These findings have implications for development of new strategies for improving oocyte in vitro maturation leading to better developmental competence.


Title #1597: Perceptual influences on self-protective behavior for West Nile virus, A survey in Colorado, USA.
PMID: 26082139
Authors: Craig W CW. Trumbo, Raquel R. Harper
Abstract: The endemic state of West Nile virus (WNv) in North America underscores the need to examine mechanisms influencing human self-protective behavior. Based on previous findings and theory, this study is designed to achieve two specific aims. First, the study will examine self-protective behavior for WNv through a hybridized treatment of the Health Belief Model that includes cognitive, affective, ecological, and proximity risk perception measures. Second, within the resulting hybridized model explore the role of ethnicity in self-protective behavior for WNv.

PMID: 26082138
Authors: Ednah N EN. Ototo, Jenard P JP. Mbugi, Christine L CL. Wanjala, Guofa G. Zhou, Andrew K AK. Githeko, Guiyun G. Yan
Abstract: Malaria is a great public health burden and Africa suffers the largest share of malaria-attributed deaths. Despite control efforts targeting indoor malaria transmission, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and deployment of indoor residual spraying, transmission of the parasite in western Kenya is still maintained. This study was carried out to determine the impact of ITNs on indoor vector densities and biting behaviour in western Kenya.


Title #1599: On the Mechanism of Gene Silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PMID: 26082137
Authors: David Lee DL. Steakley, Jasper J. Rine
Abstract: Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for gene silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ranging from steric occlusion of DNA binding proteins from their recognition sequences in silenced chromatin, to a specific block in the formation of the preinitiation complex, to a block in transcriptional elongation. This study provided strong support for the steric occlusion mechanism by the discovery that RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 could be substantially blocked from transcribing from its cognate promoter when embedded in silenced chromatin. Moreover, unlike previous suggestions, we found no evidence for stalled RNA polymerase II within silenced chromatin. The effectiveness of the Sir-protein-based silencing mechanism to block transcription activated by Gal4 at promoters in the domain of silenced chromatin was marginal, yet improved when tested against mutant forms of the Gal4 protein, highlighting a role for specific activators in their sensitivity to gene silencing.


Title #1600: Understanding effects in reviews of implementation interventions using the Theoretical Domains Framework.
PMID: 26082136
Authors: Elizabeth A EA. Little, Justin J. Presseau, Martin P MP. Eccles
Abstract: Behavioural theory can be used to better understand the effects of behaviour change interventions targeting healthcare professional behaviour to improve quality of care. However, the explicit use of theory is rarely reported despite interventions inevitably involving at least an implicit idea of what factors to target to implement change. There is a quality of care gap in the post-fracture investigation (bone mineral density (BMD) scanning) and management (bisphosphonate prescription) of patients at risk of osteoporosis. We aimed to use the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) within a systematic review of interventions to improve quality of care in post-fracture investigation. Our objectives were to explore which theoretical factors the interventions in the review may have been targeting and how this might be related to the size of the effect on rates of BMD scanning and osteoporosis treatment with bisphosphonate medication.


Title #1601: Dimeric Organization of Blood Coagulation Factor VIII bound to Lipid Nanotubes.
PMID: 26082135
Authors: Daniela D. Dalm, Jesus G JG. Galaz-Montoya, Jaimy L JL. Miller, Kirill K. Grushin, Alex A. Villalobos, Alexey Y AY. Koyfman, Michael F MF. Schmid, Svetla S. Stoilova-McPhie
Abstract: Membrane-bound Factor VIII (FVIII) has a critical function in blood coagulation as the pro-cofactor to the serine-protease Factor IXa (FIXa) in the FVIIIa-FIXa complex assembled on the activated platelet membrane. Defects or deficiency of FVIII cause Hemophilia A, a mild to severe bleeding disorder. Despite existing crystal structures for FVIII, its membrane-bound organization has not been resolved. Here we present the dimeric FVIII membrane-bound structure when bound to lipid nanotubes, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy. By combining the structural information obtained from helical reconstruction and single particle subtomogram averaging at intermediate resolution (15-20 Ã), we show unambiguously that FVIII forms dimers on lipid nanotubes. We also demonstrate that the organization of the FVIII membrane-bound domains is consistently different from the crystal structure in solution. The presented results are a critical step towards understanding the mechanism of the FVIIIa-FIXa complex assembly on the activated platelet surface in the propagation phase of blood coagulation.

Title #1607: Combinatorial anti-angiogenic gene therapy in a human malignant mesothelioma model.
PMID: 26082103
Authors: Shuji S. Kubo, Misato M. Takagi-Kimura, Noriyuki N. Kasahara
Abstract: Anti-angiogenic gene therapy represents a promising strategy for cancer; however, it has rarely been tested in malignant mesothelioma, a highly aggressive tumor associated with asbestos with poor prognosis. In the present study, we investigated whether anti-angiogenic factors such as angiostatin, endostatin and the soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptorÂ 2 (sFlk1) were able to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation via lentivirus-mediated gene transfer into malignant mesothelioma cells in culture. We also assessed whether a dual-agent strategy had greater therapeutic benefit. Human malignant pleural mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells were transduced using lentiviral vectors that individually expressed angiostatin, endostatin and sFlk1 and linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marker gene expression via an internal ribosome entry site. The lentivirus expressing EGFP alone was used as a control. The resultant cells designated as MSTO-A, MSTO-E, MSTO-F and MSTO-C were confirmed by western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy to stably express the corresponding proteins. No differences were observed in the inÂ vitro growth rates between any of these cells. However, co-culture of MSTO-A, MSTO-E and MSTO-F showed significant suppression of human umbilical endothelial cell growth inÂ vitro compared with that of MSTO-C. Furthermore, a combination of any two among MSTO-A, MSTO-E and MSTO-F significantly enhanced efficacy. These results suggest that combinatorial anti-angiogenic gene therapy targeting different pathways of endothelial growth factor signaling has the potential for greater therapeutic efficacy than that of a single-agent regimen.

Title #1609: Customised simple limbal epithelial transplantation for recurrent limbal stem cell deficiency.
PMID: 26082100
Authors: Jayesh J. Vazirani, Ikeda I. Lal, Virender V. Sangwan
Abstract: A 4-year-old boy developed unilateral, total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) following an acid injury. A stable ocular surface was achieved with autologous simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET), performed 4âmonths after the injury. Focal areas of conjunctivalisation were noted in the postoperative period. These were addressed using a novel modification of SLET. A very small piece of limbus from the healthy eye was split into multiple pieces, and applied to the bare corneal stroma with fibrin glue after pannus resection. The surface was covered with amniotic membrane. This resulted in a stable surface, and visual acuity improved to 20/50. The donor remained healthy despite two biopsies being harvested. This case demonstrates that early ocular surface reconstruction may be considered in children with LSCD if amblyopia is a concern. Customised SLET allows surgeons to tackle focal recurrences of LSCD effectively, using minimal limbal tissue from the donor site.


Title #1610: Sialolipoma of the parotid gland: a rare entity.
PMID: 26082099
Authors: Diwakar D. Pandey, Manu M. Vats, Azaz A. Akhtar, Om Prakash OP. Pathania
Abstract: Lipomatous neoplasms of the parotid gland are rare tumours contributing from 0.6% to 4.4% to all parotid neoplasms with most series reporting an incidence of 1%. It is extremely rare in females, being 10 times more common in males, and the most common age of presentation is the five to sixth decade. Numerous histological variants of salivary gland lipoma have been described. Sialolipoma is a rare variant having proliferation of mature adipocytes with secondary entrapment of the normal salivary gland element. We report a rare case of sialolipoma in the right parotid of a 45-year-old woman who was treated with superficial parotidectomy. Postoperative recovery as well as follow-up has been uneventful.


Title #1611: Neurological adverse effects of methylphenidate may be misdiagnosed as meningoencephalitis.
PMID: 26082097
Authors: Luke Blagdon LB. Snell, Dinkar D. Bakshi
Abstract: We present a case of adverse neurological effects of methylphenidate therapy for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) having developed ataxic gait, orofacial dyskinesias and choreoathetosis of the limbs. The results of all blood investigations, EEG and CT scan of the head were unremarkable. Subsequently, a detailed history revealed he was being treated for ADHD, being started on methylphenidate in the past 3âmonths. Discontinuation of methylphenidate led to significant and rapid amelioration of neurological adverse effects.


Title #1612: A genomic selection component analysis characterizes migration-selection balance.
PMID: 26082096
Authors: Patrick J PJ. Monnahan, Jack J. Colicchio, John K JK. Kelly
Abstract: The genetic differentiation of populations in response to local selection pressures has long been studied by evolutionary biologists, but key details about the process remain obscure. How rapidly can local adaptation evolve, how extensive is the process across the genome, and how strong are the opposing forces of natural selection and gene flow? Here, we combine direct measurement of survival and reproduction with whole-genome genotyping of a plant species (Mimulus guttatus) that has recently invaded a novel habitat (the Quarry population). We renovate the classic selection component method to accommodate genomic data and observe selection at SNPs throughout the genome. SNPs showing viability selection in Quarry exhibit elevated divergence from neighboring populations relative to neutral SNPs. We also find that non-significant SNPs exhibit a subtle, but still significant, change in allele frequency towards neighboring populations, a predicted effect of gene flow. Given that the Quarry population is most probably only 30-40 generations old, the alleles conferring local advantage are almost certainly older than the population itself. Thus, local adaptation owes to the recruitment of standing genetic variation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of a Si[double bond, length as m-dash]P bond was observed by temperature dependent NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations showed that the coordination of phosphasilene to tungsten lowered the rotational barrier from 19.1 to 14.2 kcal mol(-1). The thermodynamically more stable phosphinosilylene tungsten complex is formed at elevated temperatures through substituent migration.

Title #1619: The high-density lipoprotein-adjusted SCORE model worsens SCORE-based risk classification in a contemporary population of 30 824 Europeans: the Copenhagen General Population Study.
PMID: 26082084
Authors: Martin B MB. Mortensen, Shoaib S. Afzal, BÃ¸rge G BG. Nordestgaard, Erling E. Falk
Abstract: Recent European guidelines recommend to include high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in risk assessment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), using a SCORE-based risk model (SCORE-HDL). We compared the predictive performance of SCORE-HDL with SCORE in an independent, contemporary, 'low-risk' European population, focusing on ability to identify those in need of intensified CVD prevention.


Title #1620: Osthole suppresses the proliferation and accelerates the apoptosis of human glioma cells via the upregulation of microRNA-16 and downregulation of MMP-9.
PMID: 26082082
Authors: Kai K. Lin, Zhiyu Z. Gao, Bin B. Shang, Shaohua S. Sui, Qiang Q. Fu
Abstract: Osthole (7-methoxy-8-isoamyl alkenyl coumarin) has been reported to exhibit marked anticancer effects on several types of cancer. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are closely associated with the pathogenesis of glioma. Furthermore, it is reported that the upregulation of microRNAâ16 (miRâ16) by the MMPâ9 signaling pathway can restrain the proliferation of cancer cells. To examine whether osthole increases the anticancer effect on human glioma cells in the present study, the common glioma cell line, U87, was treated with osthole at concentrations of 0, 50, 100 and 200Â ÂµÎ. The effects of osthole on cell viability were determined using a 3â(4,5âdimethylthiazolâ2âthiazolyl)â2,5âdiphenylâtetrazolium bromide assay. The rate of cellular apoptosis was analyzed by measuring the activity of caspaseâ3 and using flow cytometry. The expression of MMPâ9 was determined using gelatin zymography assays and the expression of miRâ16 was determined using reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that osthole significantly suppressed the proliferation and accelerated the apoptosis of the U87 cells. Furthermore, increased expression levels of miRâ16 and reduced protein expression levels of MMPâ9 were found in the U87 cells. In addition, miRâ16 was found to regulate the expression of MMPâ9 in the U87 cells through transfection of miRâ16 precursor and antiâmiRâ16 into the U87 cells. In conclusion, these observations indicated that osthole suppressed the proliferation and accelerated the apoptosis of human glioma cells through upregulation of the expression of miRâ16 and downregulation of the expression of MMP-9.


Title #1621: Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer for the efficient and selective preconcentration of diazinon before its determination by high-performance liquid chromatography.
PMID: 26082081
Authors: Fahimeh F. Zare, Mehrorang M. Ghaedi, Ali A. Daneshfar, Abbas A. Ostovan
Abstract: A molecularly imprinted polymer was selectively applied for solid-phase extraction and diazinon residues enrichment before high-performance liquid chromatography. Diazinon was thermally copolymerized with Fe3 O4 @polyethyleneglycol nanoparticles, methacrylic acid (functional monomer), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (co-monomer), and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (cross-linking monomer) in the presence of acetonitrile (porogen) and 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (initiator). Then, the imprinted diazinon was reproducibly eluted with methanol/acetic acid (9:1, v/v). The sorbent particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The comprehensive study of variables through experimental design showed that the maximum performance was achieved under these conditions: pH 7, 10 mL sample volume, 15 mg sorbent, 10 min vortex time, 5 min ultrasonic time, 200 Î¼L methanol/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) as eluent, and 5 min desorption time. Under optimized conditions, the molecularly imprinted polymer solid-phase extraction method demonstrated a linear range (0.02-5 g mL(-1) ), a correlation coefficient of 0.997, and 0.005 g mL(-1) detection limit.

Title #1622: 3-D microscale modeling of CO2 transport and light propagation in tomato leaves enlightens photosynthesis.

Abstract: We present a combined 3-D model of light propagation, CO2 diffusion and photosynthesis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) leaves. The model incorporates a geometrical representation of the actual leaf microstructure that we obtained with synchrotron radiation X-ray laminography, and was evaluated using measurements of gas exchange and leaf optical properties. The combination of the 3-D microstructure of leaf tissue and chloroplast movement induced by changes in light intensity affects the simulated CO2 transport within the leaf. The model predicts extensive reassimilation of CO2 produced by respiration and photorespiration. Simulations also suggest that carbonic anhydrase could enhance photosynthesis at low CO2 levels but had little impact on photosynthesis at high CO2 levels. The model confirms that scaling of photosynthetic capacity with absorbed light would improve efficiency of CO2 fixation in the leaf, especially at low light intensity.


Title #1623: Differences in vertebral, tibial, and iliac cancellous bone metabolism in ovariectomized rats.

Abstract: Bone histomorphometry is usually performed on the iliac bone in humans and the tibia or vertebrae in rats. Bone metabolism differences among skeletal sites may be problematic when translating experimental results from rats to humans, but data on such differences in rats are lacking. Therefore, we examined the differences in bone structure and metabolism among skeletal sites using the lumbar vertebra (LV), tibia, and iliac bone obtained from ovariectomized or sham-operated rats preoperatively and at various times from 3Â days to 26Â weeks postoperatively. The trabeculae were thicker in the LV, where bone metabolism was less active than at other sites, and numerous fine trabeculae were observed in the tibia, where bone metabolism was more active. The iliac bone structure and metabolism were intermediate between those of the tibia and LV. Ovariectomy induced lower bone volume and higher bone metabolism in all skeletal sites, but the changes were greatest and occurred earliest in the tibia, followed by the iliac bone and then LV. Ovariectomy caused changes in bone metabolic markers, which occurred earlier than those in bone tissue. Activation frequency (Ac.f) increased after ovariectomy. At week 26 in ovariectomized rats, Ac.f was highest in the tibia (3.13Â N/year) but similar between iliac bone (0.87Â N/year) and LV (1.39Â N/year). Ac.f is reportedly 0.3-0.4Â N/year in the iliac bone of postmenopausal women, suggesting that bone turnover in rats is several times higher than in humans. The reference values reported here are useful for translating experimental results from rats to humans.


Title #1624: A prospective population-based study of health complaints in adolescence and use of social welfare benefits in young adulthood.
PMID: 26082075
Authors: Lisbeth L. Homlong, Elin O EO. Rosvold, Dag D. Bruusgaard, Lars L. Lien, Ãse Ã. Sagatun, Ole R OR. Haavet
Abstract: There is a lack of knowledge on how health problems in adolescence are connected to work marginalization in adulthood.

Title #1625: Grape pomace extract exerts antioxidant effects through an increase in GCS levels and GST activity in muscle and endothelial cells.
PMID: 26082074

Abstract: In a previous study, we demonstrated that a grape pomace extractÂ (GPE) exerted antioxidant activity in endothelial (EA.hy926) and muscle (C2C12) cells through an increase in glutathioneÂ (GSH) levels. In the present study, in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the antioxidant activity of GPE, its effects on the expression of critical antioxidant enzymes, such as catalaseÂ (CAT), superoxide dismutaseÂ (SOD)1, heme oxygenaseÂ 1Â (HO-1) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetaseÂ (GCS) were assessed in EA.hy926 and C2C12 cells. Moreover, the effects of GPE on CAT, SOD and glutathione S-transferaseÂ (GST) enzymatic activity were evaluated. For this purpose, the C2C12 and EA.hy926 cells were treated with GPE at low and non-cytotoxic concentrations (2.5Â and 10Â Âµg/ml for the C2C12 cells; 0.068 and 0.250Â Âµg/ml for the EA.hy926 cells) for 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24Â h. Following incubation, enzymatic expression and activity were assessed. The results revealed that treatment with GPE significantly increased GCS levels and GST activity in both the C2C12 and EA.hy926 cells. However, GPE significantly decreased CAT levels and activity, but only in the muscle cells, while it had no effect on CAT levels and activity in the endothelial cells. Moreover, treatment with GPE had no effect on HO-1 and SOD expression and activity in both cell lines. Therefore, the present results provide further evidence of the crucial role of GSH systems in the antioxidant effects exerted by GPE. Thus, GPE may prove to be effective for use as a food supplement for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems, particularly those associated with low GSH levels.


Title #1626: Tissue landscape alters adjacent cell fates during Drosophila egg development.
PMID: 26082073
Authors: Lathiena A LA. Manning, Ann Marie AM. Weideman, Bradford E BE. Peercy, Michelle M. Starz-Gaiano
Abstract: Extracellular signalling molecules control many biological processes, but the influence of tissue architecture on the local concentrations of these factors is unclear. Here we examine this issue in the Drosophila egg chamber, where two anterior cells secrete Unpaired (Upd) to activate Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling in the epithelium. High STAT signalling promotes cell motility. Genetic analysis shows that all cells near the Upd source can respond. However, using upright imaging, we show surprising asymmetries in STAT activation patterns, suggesting that some cells experience different Upd levels than predicted by their location. We develop a three-dimensional mathematical model to characterize the spatio-temporal distribution of the activator. Simulations show that irregular tissue domains can produce asymmetric distributions of Upd, consistent with results in vivo. Mutant analysis substantiates this idea. We conclude that cellular landscape can heavily influence the effect of diffusible activators and should be more widely considered.


Title #1627: Self-serving dishonest decisions can show facilitated cognitive dynamics.
PMID: 26082072
Authors: Maryam M. Tabatabaeian, Rick R. Dale, Nicholas D ND. Duran
Abstract: We use a novel task to test two competing hypotheses concerning the cognitive processes involved in dishonesty. Many existing accounts of deception imply that in order to act dishonestly one has to use cognitive control to overcome a bias toward the truth, which results in more time and effort. A recent hypothesis suggests that lying in order to serve self-interest may be a rapid, even automatic tendency taking less time than refraining from lying. In the current study, we track the action dynamics of potentially dishonest decisions to investigate the underlying cognitive processes. Participants are asked to privately predict the outcome of a virtual coin flip, report their accuracy and receive bonus credit for accurate predictions. The movements of the computer cursor toward the target answer are recorded and used to characterize the dynamics of decisions. Our results suggest that when a self-serving condition holds, decisions that have a high probability of being dishonest take less time and experience less hesitation.


Title #1628: Cancer risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a population-based prospective study in China.
PMID: 26082067
Authors: Meng M. Wang, Ru-Ying RY. Hu, Hai-Bin HB. Wu, Jin J. Pan, Wei-Wei WW. Gong, Li-Hua LH. Guo, Jie-Ming JM. Zhong, Fang-Rong FR. Fei, Min M. Yu
Abstract: Evidence indicates an increased cancer risk among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, yet studies in mainland China are scarce. Based on Diabetes Surveillance System linking to Cancer Surveillance System of Zhejiang Province in China, we explored the cancer risk among T2DM patients. Totally, 327,268 T2DM patients were identified and followed from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Overall cancer risk was found significantly increased with an SIR of 1.15 (95% CI 1.12-1.19) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.21-1.30) in males and females, respectively. Regarding specific cancer sites, risks of liver, colon, rectum, pancreas, and kidney were significantly increased with SIRs of 1.26 (95% CI 1.16-1.36), 1.47 (95% CI 1.29-1.67), 1.25 (95% CI 1.09-1.43), 2.81 (95% CI 2.50-3.16) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.28-2.03) in males, 1.53 (95% CI 1.35-1.73), 1.33 (95% CI 1.15-1.54), 1.29 (95% CI 1.10-1.51), 3.62 (95% CI 3.20-4.09) and 1.71 (95% CI 1.28-2.29) in females, respectively. A significant increased SIR was noted for prostate (1.80, 95% CI 1.58-2.06). Significant increased SIRs for lung (1.32, 95% CI 1.20-1.44) and stomach (1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.30) were observed in females. We suggested an increased cancer risk among T2DM patients.


Title #1629: Purinergic signaling during myogenesis: a role for adenosine and its receptors.
PMID: 26082066
Authors: S. S. Fulle
Abstract: During embryogenesis, before functional activation of the motor nerve, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR; 2Î±1Î²1Î³Î´) is regulated mainly by autocrine processes that control the maturation of skeletal muscle. A lack of, or alteration to, this regulation can lead to a series of potentially serious modifications of the differentiation processes of muscle fibres. In the early phases of the myogenic process, application of exogenous ACh and/or cholinergic agonists promotes the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes through activation of nAChR channels. The release of ACh or similar substances from immature skeletal muscle fibres was proposed almost 40 years ago by Miledi etÂ al. (1977), and subsequently confirmed by Hamann etÂ al. (1995). Moreover, considering that the opening of the embryonic muscle nAChR channel contributes to spontaneous transients of increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+) ]i ) and to twitches that are characteristic of developing myotubes before innervation, it has also been proposed that autocrine actions of ACh-like substances that can increase the opening probability of the nAChR channels might be associated with the release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Title #1630: Photopatterned oil-reservoir micromodels with tailored wetting properties.
PMID: 26082065
Authors: Hyundo H. Lee, Seung Goo SG. Lee, Patrick S PS. Doyle
Abstract: Micromodels with a simplified porous network that represents geological porous media have been used as experimental test beds for multiphase flow studies in the petroleum industry. We present a new method to fabricate reservoir micromodels with heterogeneous wetting properties. Photopatterned, copolymerized microstructures were fabricated in a bottom-up manner. The use of rationally designed copolymers allowed us to tailor the wetting behavior (oleophilic/phobic) of the structures without requiring additional surface modifications. Using this approach, two separate techniques of constructing microstructures and tailoring their wetting behavior are combined in a simple, single-step ultraviolet lithography process. This microstructuring method is fast, economical, and versatile compared with previous fabrication methods used for multi-phase micromodel experiments. The wetting behaviors of the copolymerized microstructures were quantified and demonstrative oil/water immiscible displacement experiments were conducted.


Title #1631: Immune thrombocytopenia associated with solid cancer.
PMID: 26082063
Authors: Takako T. Shimada, Toshiaki T. Saito, Ilseung I. Choi, Shinichiro S. Yamaguchi, Kumi K. Shimamoto, Kazuya K. Ariyoshi, Masao M. Okadome
Abstract: We describe a case of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) associated with ovarian cancer. At the patient's first visit to hospital, high platelet-associated IgG and low platelet count (74âÃâ10(9) /L) were noted on blood test. She was diagnosed as having ITP complicated by ovarian cancer. Four days after surgery, the platelet count had increased to within the normal range. This is the first report of a patient with ITP complicated by ovarian cancer in which the platelet count reverted to normal soon after surgery for the ovarian cancer. We also investigated the characteristics of similar solid cancers with ITP at National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.


Title #1632: Estradiol suppresses neuronal firing activity and c-Fos expression in the lateral habenula.
PMID: 26082062
Authors: Chun-Ying CY. Li, Mei-Ying MY. Song, Min M. Huang, Ji-Cheng JC. Li, Jin-Yu JY. Xiao, Hua H. Zhao
Abstract: Estradiol is an ovarian steroid hormone that regulates physiological functions in the central nervous system, including mood, cognition, sleep and mental state. Emerging evidence has revealed that there is an enrichment of cells that express the estrogen receptor in the lateral habenula (LHb) region, however, the precise biological functions of estradiol on neurons in the LHb remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine the effects of estradiol on LHb neurons, by observing neuronal firing activity, and câFos mRNA and protein expression levels in the LHb using whole cell recording, reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Ovariectomized female Wistar rats were supplemented with a range of estradiol doses across five groups: Ovariectomized (no treatment); Oil (sesame oil); low estradiol; medial estradiol (ME) and high estradiol. Circulating serum estradiol levels were assessed over a 33Â day period following surgery. Estradiol suppressed spontaneous firing activity in LHb neurons (P<0.05, compared with firing rates prior to estradiol treatment), which suggested a role for this hormone in regulating neuronal activity. Estradiol replacement therapy resulted in sustained serum estradiol levels for ~3Â weeks after surgery. The mRNA and protein levels of câFos were significantly downregulated in LHb tissues from ME rats as compared with Oil animals (P<0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that estradiol suppresses neuronal activities in the LHb region, suggesting that the LHb may be a potential target for estradiol action.


Title #1633: Cardiac telocytes are double positive for CD34/PDGFR-Î±.
PMID: 26082061

Abstract: Telocytes (TCs) are a distinct type of interstitial cells, which are featured with a small cellular body and long and thin elongations called telopodes (Tps). TCs have been widely identified in lots of tissues and organs including heart. Double staining for CD34/PDGFR-Î² (Platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î²) or CD34/Vimentin is considered to be critical for TC phenotyping. It has recently been proposed that CD34/PDGFR-Î± (Platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î±) is actually a specific marker for TCs including cardiac TCs although the direct evidence is still lacking. Here, we showed that cardiac TCs were double positive for CD34/PDGFR-Î± in primary culture. CD34/PDGFR-Î± positive cells (putative cardiac TCs) also existed in mice ventricle and human cardiac valves including mitral valve, tricuspid valve and aortic valve. Over 87% of cells in a TC-enriched culture of rat cardiac interstitial cells were positive for PDGFR-Î±, while CD34/PDGFR-Î± double positive cells accounted for 30.25% of the whole cell population. We show that cardiac TCs are double positive for CD34/PDGFR-Î±. Better understanding of the immunocytochemical phenotypes of cardiac TCs might help using cardiac TCs as a novel source in cardiac repair.

Title #1641: Exploration of the binding interaction of a potential nervous system stimulant with calf-thymus DNA and dissociation of the drug-DNA complex by detergent sequestration.
PMID: 26082043
Authors: Pronab P. Kundu, Saptarshi S. Ghosh, Nitin N. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The binding interaction of a potential nervous system stimulant, 3-acetyl-4-oxo-6,7-dihydro-12H-indolo-[2,3-a]-quinolizine (AODIQ), with calf-thymus DNA (ctDNA) has been explored thoroughly. The modified photophysics of the fluorescent molecule within the microheterogeneous biomacromolecular system has been exploited to divulge the drug-DNA binding interaction. The absorption and various fluorometric measurements together with the fluorescence quenching, urea-induced denaturation study, circular dichroism and DNA-melting studies unequivocally ascertain the mode of binding of the drug with the DNA to be groove binding. Corroborating the experimental observations, molecular docking simulation projects the minor groove of the biomacromolecule to be the site of binding. Further experiments have revealed that dissociation of the drug from the drug-DNA complex can be achieved by the detergent sequestration method. Besides providing an insight into the drug-DNA interaction the work also demonstrates the surfactant-induced excretion of the drug from the biomacromolecular assembly.


Title #1642: Three-dimensional SnO2@TiO2 double-shell nanotubes on carbon cloth as a flexible anode for lithium-ion batteries.
PMID: 26082042
Authors: Haifeng H. Zhang, Weina W. Ren, Chuanwei C. Cheng
Abstract: In this study, three-dimensional SnO2@TiO2 double-shell nanotubes on carbon cloth are synthesized by a combination of the hydrothermal method for ZnO nanorods and a subsequent SnO2 and TiO2 thin film coating with atomic layer deposition (ALD). The as-prepared SnO2@TiO2 double-shell nanotubes are further tested as a flexible anode for Li ion batteries. The SnO2@TiO2 double-shell nanotubes/carbon cloth electrode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity (e.g. 778.8 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 780 mA g(-1)) and good cycling performance, which could be attributed to the 3D double-layer nanotube structure. The interior space of the stable TiO2 hollow tube can accommodate the large internal stress caused by volume expansion of SnO2 and protect SnO2 from pulverization and exfoliation.


Title #1643: Structural stability and polarisation of ionic liquid films on silica surfaces.
PMID: 26082041
Authors: Filippo F. Federici Canova, Masashi M. Mizukami, Takako T. Imamura, Kazue K. Kurihara, Alexander L AL. Shluger
Abstract: We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of disorder of the hydroxylated amorphous silica surface on the structure of 8 nm IL films formed from two ionic liquids featuring the same cation 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium or [BMIM], paired with bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)amide [NTF2] and tetrafluoroborate [BF4] anions. Several silica surfaces were modelled to estimate the effect of their atomic-scale configuration on the solid-liquid interface and the results are compared to those simulated on the crystalline cristobalite surface. Using strongly polar surfaces, we could also evaluate the response of the ILs to the electric field externally controlled or generated by charged defects in the silica film. We found that the structure of the liquids becomes weaker away from the interface and more susceptible to electric field. Our simulations show that [BMIM][BF4] has a large intrinsic dipole originating at the interface, resilient to external fields, while the polarisation of [BMIM][NTF2] can be more easily controlled.

Title #1645: Species Authentication of Common Meat Based on PCR Analysis of the Mitochondrial COI Gene.
PMID: 26082039
Authors: Zhenyu Z. Dai, Jiao J. Qiao, Siran S. Yang, Shen S. Hu, Jingjing J. Zuo, Weifeng W. Zhu, Chunhong C. Huang
Abstract: Adulteration of meat products and costly animal-derived commodities with their inferior/cheaper counterparts is a grievous global problem. Species authentication is still technical challenging, especially to those deep processed products. The present study described the design of seven sets of species-specific primer based on a high heterozygous region of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. These primers were proven to have high species specificity and no cross-reactions and unexpected products to different DNA source. Multiplex PCR assay was achieved for rapid and economical identification of four commonly consumed meats (pork, beef, chicken, and mutton). The conventional PCR assay was sensitive down to 0.001Â ng of DNA template in the reactant. The developed method was also powerful in detecting as low as 0.1-mg adulterated pork (0.05Â % in wt/wt) in an artificial counterfeited mutton. Validation test showed that the assay is specific, reproducible, and robust in commercial deep processed meats, leatherware, and feather commodities. This proposed method will be greatly beneficial to the consumers, food industry, leather, and feather commodity manufacture.

Abstract: Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an extremely rare but aggressive malignancy of hematopoietic origin. The diagnosis of HS mainly relies on pathological morphology and immunohistochemical staining combined with clinical symptoms. However, whether histiocytic sarcoma can be detected using flow cytometry (FCM) is not clear. We report the case of a 61-year-old female patient with a group of abnormal cells identified primarily by FCM. Largeabnormal cells -CD68(+) CD11c(+) CD14(+) HLA-DR(+) CD123(+) CD45(+) presented in upper forward scatter and side scatter, indicating that a malignancy originally derived from monocyte/macrophage could be histocytic sarcoma. This patient with histiocytic sarcoma was finally confirmed with pathology and immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, HS can be detected by assessment of CD68(+) CD11c(+) CD14(+) HLA-DR(+) CD123(+) CD45(+) cells using FCM, suggesting that FCM can be an effective tool for early finding of HS.

Title #1648: Applications and limitations of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps for measuring biting densities of African malaria vector populations: a pooled-analysis of 13 comparisons with human landing catches.
PMID: 26082036
Authors: Olivier J T OJ. BriÃ«t, Bernadette J BJ. Huho, John E JE. Gimnig, Nabie N. Bayoh, Aklilu A. Seyoum, Chadwick H CH. Sikaala, Nicodem N. Govella, Diadier A DA. Diallo, Salim S. Abdullah, Thomas A TA. Smith, Gerry F GF. Killeen
Abstract: Measurement of densities of host-seeking malaria vectors is important for estimating levels of disease transmission, for appropriately allocating interventions, and for quantifying their impact. The gold standard for estimating mosquito-human contact rates is the human landing catch (HLC), where human volunteers catch mosquitoes that land on their exposed body parts. This approach necessitates exposure to potentially infectious mosquitoes, and is very labour intensive. There are several safer and less labour-intensive methods, with Centers for Disease Control light traps (LT) placed indoors near occupied bed nets being the most widely used.


Title #1649: Identification of mammalian-adapting mutations in the polymerase complex of an avian H5N1 influenza virus.

Abstract: Avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype pose a serious global health threat due to the high mortality (>60%) associated with the disease caused by these viruses and the lack of protective antibodies to these viruses in the general population. The factors that enable avian H5N1 influenza viruses to replicate in humans are not completely understood. Here we use a high-throughput screening approach to identify novel mutations in the polymerase genes of an avian H5N1 virus that confer efficient polymerase activity in mammalian cells. Several of the identified mutations (which have previously been found in natural isolates) increase viral replication in mammalian cells and virulence in infected mice compared with the wild-type virus. The identification of amino-acid mutations in avian H5N1 influenza virus polymerase complexes that confer increased replication and virulence in mammals is important for the identification of circulating H5N1 viruses with an increased potential to infect humans.


Title #1650: Differential roles of Bcl2L12 and its short variant in breast cancer lymph node metastasis.
PMID: 26082034
Authors: Shang-Tao ST. Chien, Tzu-Feng TF. Yang, Ming-Chang MC. Yang, Ching-Mei CM. Hsu, Yi-Ren YR. Hong, Tai-Min TM. Lee
Abstract: Bcl2L12 plays a role in post-mitochondrial apoptosis through multiple mechanisms involving p53, Î±B-crystallin, caspase-3 and -7 in glioblastoma. Bcl2L12 is reported to be a good prognostic marker in breast cancer and correlated with ER and Bcl2 expression status. However, the mechanisms by which Bcl2L12 regulates apoptosis in breast cancer (BCa) remain unknown. Recent studies have shown that Bcl2L12 expression is a useful biomarker in other types of cancer. Thus, we examined whether Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA were associated with breast cancer progression or a specific subtype. In total, 106 paraffin-embedded, different stage breast cancer specimens were prepared and quantified for Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A expression by PCR. The correlation between Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA levels and clinicopathological characteristics was statistically analyzed. The results showed that Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA expression was not significantly different across the different stage, grade and TNM classification groups (P>0.005). Using linear regression, Bcl2L12 mRNA was associated with Bcl2L12A mRNA, gradeÂ 3 tumor and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. In non-TNBC specimens, Bcl2L12 mRNA was only correlated with Bcl2L12A mRNA. Bcl2L12A mRNA was positively associated with Bcl2L12 mRNA and the number of lymph node metastases, but negatively correlated with staging in the non-TNBC group. Specifically, Bcl2L12, but not Bcl2L12A, mRNA was significantly higher in TNBC and gradeÂ 3 tumors, respectively. In non-TNBC, Bcl2L12A mRNA was significantly highly expressed in tumors with â¥12Â metastatic lymph nodes. Bcl2L12 and its variant mRNA were highly expressed in carcinoma inÂ situ (CIS) samples. In addition, they were estimated to be correlated with the total sample and non-TNBC, but not the TNBC group. In summary, a high Bcl2L12 mRNA expression was associated with the high-grade BCa and TNBC subtype. In addition, the interplay between Bcl2L12 and its variant may be associated with high lymph node metastasis in non-TNBC tumors.


Title #1651: Mineralocorticoid receptor suppresses cancer progression and Warburg effect by modulating miR-338-3p-PKLR axis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PMID: 26082033

Abstract: Hormones and their corresponding receptors are vital in controlling metabolism under normal physiologic and pathologic conditions, while little is known about their roles in metabolism of cancer. Using an siRNA screening approach, we examined the effects of silencing twenty well-known hormone receptors on the Warburg effect, specifically by measuring the production of lactate in four established hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. We found that silencing a variety of hormone receptors had effects on the production of this metabolite. To our surprise, silencing of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) significantly increased lactate production in all these HCC cell lines. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies showed that gain- and loss-of-function of MR significantly influenced HCC cellular proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that MR as a transcriptional factor directly regulated the expression of miR-338-3p, suppressing the Warburg effects of HCC cells by targeting a key enzyme of glycolysis, pyruvate kinase, liver and RBC (PKLR). Moreover, MR expression was significantly down-regulated in 81% of HCC patient tissues caused by both chromosome deletion and histone deacetylation. Low expression of MR in tumor tissues was associated with a poor patient prognosis. The expression level of miR-338-3p was found to positively correlate with the expression of MR in HCC tissues and inversely correlate with PKLR expression.


Title #1652: Early Parenting and the Development of Externalizing Behavior Problems: Longitudinal Mediation Through Children's Executive Function.
PMID: 26082032
Authors: Michael J MJ. Sulik, Clancy C. Blair, Roger R. Mills-Koonce, Daniel D. Berry, Mark M. Greenberg, 
Abstract: Path analysis was used to investigate the longitudinal associations among parenting and children's executive function and externalizing behavior problems from 36 to 90Â months of age in the Family Life Project (NÂ =Â 1,115), a study of child development in the context of rural poverty. While controlling for stability in the constructs, semistructured observations of parenting prospectively predicted performance on a battery of executive function tasks and primary caregivers' reports of externalizing behavior. Furthermore, the association between early parenting and later externalizing behavior was longitudinally mediated by executive function, providing support for a process model in which sensitive parenting promotes children's self-regulation, which in turn reduces children's externalizing behavior.


Title #1653: Crystal Structure of DsbA from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Its Functional Implications for CueP in Gram-Positive Bacteria.
PMID: 26082031
Authors: Si-Hyeon SH. Um, Jin-Sik JS. Kim, Saemee S. Song, Nam Ah NA. Kim, Seong Hoon SH. Jeong, Nam-Chul NC. Ha
Abstract: In Gram-negative bacteria in the periplasmic space, the dimeric thioredoxin-fold protein DsbC isomerizes and reduces incorrect disulfide bonds of unfolded proteins, while the monomeric thioredoxin-fold protein DsbA introduces disulfide bonds in folding proteins. In the Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the reduced form of CueP scavenges the production of hydroxyl radicals in the copper-mediated Fenton reaction, and DsbC is responsible for keeping CueP in the reduced, active form. Some DsbA proteins fulfill the functions of DsbCs, which are not present in Gram-positive bacteria. In this study, we identified a DsbA homologous protein (CdDsbA) in the Corynebacterium diphtheriae genome and determined its crystal structure in the reduced condition at 1.5 Ã resolution. CdDsbA consists of a monomeric thioredoxin-like fold with an inserted helical domain and unique N-terminal extended region. We confirmed that CdDsbA has disulfide bond isomerase/reductase activity, and we present evidence that the N-terminal extended region is not required for this activity and folding of the core DsbA-like domain. Furthermore, we found that CdDsbA could reduce CueP from C. diphtheriae.


Title #1654: Anion Transport or Nucleotide Binding by Ucp2 Is Indispensable for Ucp2-Mediated Efferocytosis.
PMID: 26082030

Abstract: Rapid and efficient engulfment of apoptotic cells is an essential property of phagocytes for removal of the large number of apoptotic cells generated in multicellular organisms. To achieve this, phagocytes need to be able to continuously uptake apoptotic cells. It was recently reported that uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) promotes engulfment of apoptotic cells by increasing the phagocytic capacity, thereby allowing cells to continuously ingest apoptotic cells. However, the functions of Ucp2, beyond its possible role in dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, that contribute to elevation of the phagocytic capacity have not been determined. Here, we report that the anion transfer or nucleotide binding activity of Ucp2, as well as its dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, is necessary for Ucp2-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells. To study these properties, we generated Ucp2 mutations that affected three different functions of Ucp2, namely, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, transfer of anions, and binding of purine nucleotides. Mutations of Ucp2 that affected the proton leak did not enhance the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Although anion transfer and nucleotide binding mutations did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, they exerted a dominant-negative effect on Ucp2-mediated engulfment. Furthermore, none of our Ucp2 mutations increased the phagocytic capacity. We conclude that dissipation of the proton gradient by Ucp2 is not the only determinant of the phagocytic capacity and that anion transfer or nucleotide binding by Ucp2 is also essential for Ucp2-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells.


Title #1655: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 3 Is Required for Regulation during Dark-Light Transition.
PMID: 26082029
Authors: Horim H. Lee
Abstract: Plant growth and development are coordinately orchestrated by environmental cues and phytohormones. Light acts as a key environmental factor for fundamental plant growth and physiology through photosensory phytochromes and underlying molecular mechanisms. Although phytochromes are known to possess serine/threonine protein kinase activities, whether they trigger a signal transduction pathway via an intracellular protein kinase network remains unknown. In analyses of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK, also called MKK) mutants, the mkk3 mutant has shown both a hypersensitive response in plant hormone gibberellin (GA) and a less sensitive response in red light signaling. Surprisingly, light-induced MAPK activation in wild-type (WT) seedlings and constitutive MAPK phosphorylation in dark-grown mkk3 mutant seedlings have also been found, respectively. Therefore, this study suggests that MKK3 acts in negative regulation in darkness and in light-induced MAPK activation during darklight transition.


Title #1656: Validating administrative records in post-traumatic stress disorder.
PMID: 26082028
Authors: Thad E TE. Abrams, Mary M. Vaughan-Sarrazin, Terence M TM. Keane, Kelly K. Richardson
Abstract: There is insufficient data on the accuracy of administrative coding data (ACD) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Medical records were reviewed for (1) a diagnosis of PTSD; (2) treatment for PTSD. The records were compared against the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data in order to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of three commonly used approaches. The PPV and NPV varied according to the ACD approach. Relative to a medical records review, the ACD approach of one or two PTSD coded outpatient encounters had a PPV of 78% and an NPV of 91%; whereas the PPV was 97% and the NPV was 98% for three or more PTSD codes. For pharmacotherapy, the ACD approach with one or two codes for PTSD had a PPV of 33% (NPVâ=â93%), whereas three or more PTSD coded encounters improved the PPV to 85% (NPVâ=â100%). When using VHA data, we recommend tailoring the identification strategy according to the research aims. An ACD approach identifying one or more PTSD outpatient encounters should be considered sufficient for a diagnosis of PTSD. Assessments for PTSD associated pharmacotherapy require using an ACD approach that identifies veterans with the presenceââ¥â3 outpatient PTSD encounters.

Title #1657: Evaluation of dose conversion coefficients for an eight-year-old Iranian male phantom undergoing computed tomography.
PMID: 26082027
Authors: Parisa P. Akhlaghi, Hashem H. Miri Hakimabad, Laleh L. Rafat Motavalli
Abstract: In order to construct a library of Iranian pediatric voxel phantoms for radiological protection and dosimetry applications, an Iranian eight-year-old phantom was constructed from a series of CT images. Organ and effective dose conversion coefficients to this phantom were calculated for head, chest, abdominopelvis and chest-abdomen-pelvis scans at tube voltages of 80, 100 and 120Â kVp. To validate the results, the organ and effective dose conversion coefficients obtained were compared with those of the University of Florida eight-year-old voxel female phantom as a function of examination type and anatomical scan area. For a detailed study, depth distributions of organs together with the thickness of surrounding tissues located in the beam path, which are shielding the internal organs, were determined for these two voxel phantoms. The relation between the anatomical differences and the level of delivered dose was investigated and the discrepancies among the results justified.


Title #1658: Investigation of the effective atomic numbers of dosimetric materials for electrons, protons and alpha particles using a direct method in the energy region 10Â keV-1Â GeV: a comparative study.
PMID: 26082026
Authors: Murat M. Kurudirek, OÄuz O. Aksakal, Tuba T. AkkuÅ
Abstract: A direct method has been used for the first time, to compute effective atomic numbers (Z eff) of water, air, human tissues, and some organic and inorganic compounds, for total electron proton and alpha particle interaction in the energy region 10Â keV-1Â GeV. The obtained values for Z eff were then compared to those obtained using an interpolation procedure. In general, good agreement has been observed for electrons, and the difference (%) in Z eff between the results of the direct and the interpolation method was found to be <10Â % for all materials, in the energy range from 10Â keV to 1Â MeV. More specifically, results of the two methods were found to agree well (Dif. <10Â %) for air, calcium fluoride, kapton polyimide film, paraffin wax and plastic scintillator in the entire energy region with respect to the total electron interaction. On the other hand, values for Z eff calculated using both methods for protons and alpha particles generally agree with each other in the high-energy region above 10Â MeV.


Title #1659: Sodium MRI of the human heart at 7.0âT: preliminary results.
PMID: 26082025
Authors: Andreas A. Graessl, Anjuli A. Ruehle, Helmar H. Waiczies, Ana A. Resetar, Stefan H SH. Hoffmann, Jan J. Rieger, Friedrich F. Wetterling, Lukas L. Winter, Armin M AM. Nagel, Thoralf T. Niendorf
Abstract: The objective of this work was to examine the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) and whole heart coverage (23) Na cardiac MRI at 7.0âT including single-cardiac-phase and cinematic (cine) regimes. A four-channel transceiver RF coil array tailored for (23) Na MRI of the heart at 7.0âT (fâ=â78.5âMHz) is proposed. An integrated bow-tie antenna building block is used for (1) H MR to support shimming, localization and planning in a clinical workflow. Signal absorption rate simulations and assessment of RF power deposition were performed to meet the RF safety requirements. (23) Na cardiac MR was conducted in an in vivo feasibility study. 3D gradient echo (GRE) imaging in conjunction with Cartesian phase encoding (total acquisition time TAQ â=â6âmin 16âs) and whole heart coverage imaging employing a density-adapted 3D radial acquisition technique (TAQ â=â18âmin 20âs) were used. For 3D GRE-based (23) Na MRI, acquisition of standard views of the heart using a nominal in-plane resolution of (5.0âÃâ5.0) mm(2) and a slice thickness of 15âmm were feasible. For whole heart coverage 3D density-adapted radial (23) Na acquisitions a nominal isotropic spatial resolution of 6âmm was accomplished. This improvement versus 3D conventional GRE acquisitions reduced partial volume effects along the slice direction and enabled retrospective image reconstruction of standard or arbitrary views of the heart. Sodium cine imaging capabilities were achieved with the proposed RF coil configuration in conjunction with 3D radial acquisitions and cardiac gating. Cardiac-gated reconstruction provided an enhancement in blood-myocardium contrast of 20% versus the same data reconstructed without cardiac gating. The proposed transceiver array enables (23) Na MR of the human heart at 7.0âT within clinical acceptable scan times. This capability is in positive alignment with the needs of explorations that are designed to examine the potential of (23) Na MRI for the assessment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

Title #1660: The CrdRS two-component system in Helicobacter pylori responds to nitrosative stress.
PMID: 26082024

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori inhabits the gastric mucosa where it senses and responds to various stresses via a two-component systems (TCSs) that enable its persistent colonization. The aim of this study was to investigate whether any of the three paired TCSs (ArsRS, FleRS, and CrdRS) in H. pylori respond to nitrosative stress. The results showed that the expression of crdS was significantly increased upon exposure to nitric oxide (NO). crdS-knockout (ÎcrdS) and crdR/crdS-knockout (ÎcrdRS) H. pylori, but not arsS-knockout (ÎarsS) or fleS-knockout (ÎfleS) H. pylori, showed a significant loss of viability upon exposure to NO compared to wild-type strain. Knockin crdS (ÎcrdS-in) significantly restored viability in the presence of NO. Global transcriptional profiling analysis of wild-type and ÎcrdS H. pylori in the presence or absence of NO showed that 101 genes were differentially expressed, including copper resistance determinant A (crdA), transport, binding, and envelope proteins. The CrdR binding motifs were investigated by competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which revealed that the two AC-rich regions in the crdA promoter region are required for binding. These results demonstrate that CrdR-crdA interaction enables H. pylori to survive under nitrosative stress.

Title #1662: Therapeutic effect of Active Hexose-Correlated Compound (AHCC) combined with CpG-ODN (oligodeoxynucleotide) in B16 melanoma murine model.
PMID: 26082022
Authors: Rosa Mistica RM. Ignacio, Cheol-Su CS. Kim, Young-Do YD. Kim, Hak-Min HM. Lee, Xu-Feng XF. Qi, Soo-Ki SK. Kim
Abstract: While Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) are separately known to modulate oxidative stress and immune responses in cancer patients, the combined effect of these two compounds is unknown. To clarify this, we investigated whether AHCC plus KSK-CpG ODN would be therapeutic in B16 melanoma mouse model, if so, and how in reduction-oxidation (redox) balance and cytokines network. We found that treatment groups (AHCC only, KSK-CpG ODN only and AHCC/KSK-CpG ODN) markedly reduced (p<0.001) tumor size when compared to the positive control (PC) group. The total white blood cell (WBC) of AHCC only and KSK-CpG ODN only-treated groups showed significant lower counts than that of PC group. Next, the production of nitric oxide (NO) was significantly increased (p<0.01) in AHCC/KSK-CpG ODN group compared to the PC group. Further, the redox balance was improved in AHCC/KSK-CpG ODN group through significantly low (p<0.001) reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and significantly high (p<0.05) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity compared to the PC group. Finally, AHCC/KSK-CpG ODN (p<0.01) and KSK-CpG ODN (p<0.001)-treated groups augmented tumor immune surveillance as shown by significantly increased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and significantly decreased (p<0.05) level of pro-tumorigenic IL-6 of AHCC/KSK-CpG ODN treated group as compared to the PC group. Collectively, our study indicates therapeutic effect of Active Hexose-Correlated Compound (AHCC) combined with KSK-CpG ODN in B16 melanoma murine model via balancing redox and cytokines network.


Title #1663: Defective cytokine production early after multiple traumas: Modulation in severe sepsis.

Abstract: The exact time frame of multiple trauma-induced immunosuppression and the immune mechanisms mediating transition to severe sepsis are largely unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 69 patients with multiple injuries within the first 24h from injury and from 36 healthy volunteers and stimulated for cytokine production. Circulating endotoxins were measured by the kinetic LAL assay. Measurements were repeated the first 24h of sepsis onset. Patients had defective responses for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17 and interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) using a broad-panel of bacterial stimuli. Production of IFNÎ³ was pronounced for patients with trauma-related multiple organ failure (MOF). Thirty-six patients developed severe sepsis. At that time, production of TNFÎ± was increased compared to baseline. The increase was greater among non-survivors than among survivors. Enhanced TNFÎ± production on sepsis onset was a main finding of patients without endotoxemia. Immunosuppression of both innate and adaptive cytokine responses appears as early as the first 24h from injury. Transition into severe sepsis due to bacterial superinfection is accompanied by enhanced production of TNFÎ± and this is linked with unfavorable outcome.

PMID: 26082020
Authors: Natalie N. Koerner, Peggy P. Schmidt, Michael M. Soyka
Abstract: Alcohol dependence is associated with deficits in decision making and increased impulsiveness. Therefore, we compared decision making in abstinent alcohol-dependent people ("abstainers") and matched healthy individuals ("comparison group") to determine whether impulsiveness or personality traits play a role in decision making.


Title #1665: Mitigating mechanical failure of crystalline silicon electrodes for lithium batteries by morphological design.
PMID: 26082019
Authors: Yonghao Y. An, Brandon C BC. Wood, Jianchao J. Ye, Yet-Ming YM. Chiang, Y Morris YM. Wang, Ming M. Tang, Hanqing H. Jiang
Abstract: Although crystalline silicon (c-Si) anodes promise very high energy densities in Li-ion batteries, their practical use is complicated by amorphization, large volume expansion and severe plastic deformation upon lithium insertion. Recent experiments have revealed the existence of a sharp interface between crystalline Si (c-Si) and the amorphous LixSi alloy during lithiation, which propagates with a velocity that is orientation dependent; the resulting anisotropic swelling generates substantial strain concentrations that initiate cracks even in nanostructured Si. Here we describe a novel strategy to mitigate lithiation-induced fracture by using pristine c-Si structures with engineered anisometric morphologies that are deliberately designed to counteract the anisotropy in the crystalline/amorphous interface velocity. This produces a much more uniform volume expansion, significantly reducing strain concentration. Based on a new, validated methodology that improves previous models of anisotropic swelling of c-Si, we propose optimal morphological designs for c-Si pillars and particles. The advantages of the new morphologies are clearly demonstrated by mesoscale simulations and verified by experiments on engineered c-Si micropillars. The results of this study illustrate that morphological design is effective in improving the fracture resistance of micron-sized Si electrodes, which will facilitate their practical application in next-generation Li-ion batteries. The model and design approach present in this paper also have general implications for the study and mitigation of mechanical failure of electrode materials that undergo large anisotropic volume change upon ion insertion and extraction.


Title #1666: Regional differences in the cerebral blood flow velocity response to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes.

Abstract: Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) may appear above 2,500âm altitude, if the time allowed for acclimatization is insufficient. As the mechanisms underlying brain adaptation to the hypobaric hypoxic environment are not fully understood, a prospective study was performed investigating neurophysiological changes by means of near infrared spectroscopy, electroencephalograpy (EEG), and transcranial doppler sonography at 100, 3,440 and 5,050âm above sea level in the Khumbu Himal, Nepal. Fourteen of the 26 mountaineers reaching 5,050âm altitude developed symptoms of AMS between 3,440 and 5,050âm altitude (Lake-Louise Score â©¾3). Their EEG frontal beta activity and occipital alpha activity increased between 100 and 3,440âm altitude, i.e., before symptoms appeared. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) increased in all mountaineers between 100 and 3,440âm altitude. During further ascent to 5,050âm altitude, mountaineers with AMS developed a further increase in CBFV in the MCA, whereas in all mountaineers CBFV decreased continuously with increasing altitude in the posterior cerebral arteries. These results indicate that hypobaric hypoxia causes different regional changes in CBFV despite similar electrophysiological changes.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.142.


Title #1667: Noninvasive high-speed photoacoustic tomography of cerebral hemodynamics in awake-moving rats.
PMID: 26082016

Abstract: We present a noninvasive method of photoacoustic tomography (PAT) for imaging cerebral hemodynamics in awake-moving rats. The wearable PAT (wPAT) system has a size of 15âmm in height and 33âmm in diameter, and a weight of ~8âg (excluding cabling). The wPAT achieved an imaging rate of 3.33 frames/s with a lateral resolution of 243âÎ¼m. Animal experiments were designed to show wPAT feasibility for imaging cerebral hemodynamics on awake-moving animals. Results showed that the cerebral oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin changed significantly in response to hyperoxia; and, after the injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), cerebral blood volume changed faster over time and larger in amplitude for rats in awake-moving state compared with rats under anesthesia. By providing a light-weight, high-resolution technology for in vivo monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics in awake-behaving animals, it will be possible to develop a comprehensive understanding on how activity alters hemodynamics in normal and diseased states.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.138.

Abstract: A disturbance in redox balance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. This study sought to examine the feasibility of imaging brain redox status using a (11)C-labeled dihydroquinoline derivative ([(11)C]DHQ1) for positron emission tomography (PET). The lipophilic PET tracer [(11)C]DHQ1 was rapidly oxidized to its hydrophilic form in mouse brain homogenate. The redox modulators diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin significantly reduced the initial velocity of [(11)C]DHQ1 oxidation, and apocynin also caused concentration-dependent inhibition of the initial velocity. Moreover, [(11)C]DHQ1 readily entered the brain by diffusion after administration and underwent oxidation into the hydrophilic cationic form, which then slowly decreased. By contrast, apocynin treatment inhibited the in vivo oxidation of [(11)C]DHQ1 to the hydrophilic cationic form, leading to a rapid decrease of radioactivity in the brain. Thus, the difference in the [(11)C]DHQ1 kinetics reflects the alteration in redox status caused by apocynin. In conclusion, [(11)C]DHQ1 is a potential PET tracer for imaging of redox status in the living brain.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.132.


Title #1669: Selective neuronal vulnerability of human hippocampal CA1 neurons: lesion evolution, temporal course, and pattern of hippocampal damage in diffusion-weighted MR imaging.

Abstract: The CA1 (cornu ammonis) region of hippocampus is selectively vulnerable to a variety of metabolic and cytotoxic insults, which is mirrored in a delayed neuronal death of CA1 neurons. The basis and mechanisms of this regional susceptibility of CA1 neurons are poorly understood, and the correlates in human diseases affecting the hippocampus are not clear. Adopting a translational approach, the lesion evolution, temporal course, pattern of diffusion changes, and damage in hippocampal CA1 in acute neurologic disorders were studied using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. In patients with hippocampal ischemia (n=50), limbic encephalitis (n=30), after status epilepticus (n=17), and transient global amnesia (n=53), the CA1 region was selectively affected compared with other CA regions of the hippocampus. CA1 neurons exhibited a maximum decrease of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 48 to 72âhours after the insult, irrespective of the nature of the insult. Hypoxic-ischemic insults led to a significant lower ADC suggesting that the ischemic insult results in a stronger impairment of cellular metabolism. The evolution of diffusion changes show that CA1 diffusion lesions mirror the delayed time course of the pathophysiologic cascade typically observed in animal models. Studying the imaging correlates of hippocampal damage in humans provides valuable insight into the pathophysiology and neurobiology of the hippocampus.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.137.


Title #1670: Optogenetic stimulation of GABA neurons can decrease local neuronal activity while increasing cortical blood flow.
PMID: 26082013
Authors: Eitan E. Anenberg, Allen W AW. Chan, Yicheng Y. Xie, Jeffrey M JM. LeDue, Timothy H TH. Murphy
Abstract: We investigated the link between direct activation of inhibitory neurons, local neuronal activity, and hemodynamics. Direct optogenetic cortical stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex of transgenic mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons (VGAT-ChR2) greatly attenuated spontaneous cortical spikes, but was sufficient to increase blood flow as measured with laser speckle contrast imaging. To determine whether the observed optogenetically evoked gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-neuron hemodynamic responses were dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic or GABAergic synaptic mechanisms, we paired optogenetic stimulation with application of antagonists to the cortex. Incubation of glutamatergic antagonists directly on the cortex (NBQX and MK-801) blocked cortical sensory evoked responses (as measured with electroencephalography and intrinsic optical signal imaging), but did not significantly attenuate optogenetically evoked hemodynamic responses. Significant light-evoked hemodynamic responses were still present after the addition of picrotoxin (GABA-A receptor antagonist) in the presence of the glutamatergic synaptic blockade. This activation of cortical inhibitory interneurons can mediate large changes in blood flow in a manner that is by and large not dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic or GABAergic synaptic transmission. This supports the hypothesis that activation of inhibitory neurons can increase local cerebral blood flow in a manner that is not entirely dependent on levels of net ongoing neuronal activity.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.140.


Title #1671: Interleukin-1Î² transfer across the blood-brain barrier in the ovine fetus.

Abstract: Pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction represents an important component of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the fetus. Hypoxic-ischemic injury could accentuate systemic cytokine transfer across the fetal BBB. There has been considerable conjecture suggesting that systemic cytokines could cross the BBB during the perinatal period. Nonetheless, evidence to support this contention is sparse. We hypothesized that ischemia-reperfusion increases the transfer of systemic interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) across the BBB in the fetus. Ovine fetuses at 127 days of gestation were studied 4 hours after 30âminutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and compared with a nonischemic group. Recombinant ovine IL-1Î² protein was expressed from an IL-1Î² pGEX-2âT vector in E. coli BL-21 cells and purified. The BBB function was quantified in 12 brain regions using a blood-to-brain transfer constant with intravenous (125)I-radiolabeled IL-1Î² ((125)I-IL-1Î²). Interleukin-1Î² crossed the intact BBB in nonischemic fetuses. Blood-to-brain transport of (125)I-IL-1Î² was higher (P<0.05) across brain regions in fetuses exposed to ischemia-reperfusion than nonischemic fetuses. We conclude that systemic IL-1Î² crosses the intact fetal BBB, and that ischemia-reperfusion increases transfer of this cytokine across the fetal BBB. Therefore, altered BBB function after hypoxia-ischemia facilitates entry of systemic cytokines into the brain of the fetus.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.134.


Title #1672: A question of cytokine signaling in the fetus.
PMID: 26082011
Authors: Charles E CE. Wood
Abstract: The study by Sadowska and colleagues, featured in this edition of Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, provides compelling insight into a critical mechanism of signaling that links somatic and brain inflammatory pathways. Brain inflammation is often treated as an isolated event, but the work by Sadowska et al clearly demonstrate that interleukin 1Î² crosses the fetal blood brain barrier, and that the rate of transfer increases after cerebral ischemia. It is, perhaps, time to link blood-borne cytokine signaling with alterations in the course of fetal brain development, especially after transient fetal hypoxia.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.135.

Abstract: Interventional studies suggest that changes in physical fitness affect brain function and structure. We studied the influence of high intensity physical exercise on hippocampal volume and metabolism in 17 young healthy male adults during a 6-week exercise program compared with matched controls. We further aimed to relate these changes to hypothesized changes in exercised-induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±). We show profound improvement of physical fitness in most subjects and a positive correlation between the degree of fitness improvement and increased BDNF levels. We unexpectedly observed an average volume decrease of about 2%, which was restricted to right hippocampal subfields CA2/3, subiculum, and dentate gyrus and which correlated with fitness improvement and increased BDNF levels negatively. This result indicates that mainly those subjects who did not benefit from the exercise program show decreased hippocampal volume, reduced BDNF levels, and increased TNF-Î± concentrations. While spectroscopy results do not indicate any neuronal loss (unchanged N-acetylaspartate levels) decreased glutamate-glutamine levels were observed in the right anterior hippocampus in the exercise group only. Responder characteristics need to be studied in more detail. Our results point to an important role of the inflammatory response after exercise on changes in hippocampal structure.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.125.


Title #1674: Blocking of fatty acid amide hydrolase activity with PF-04457845 in human brain: a positron emission tomography study with the novel radioligand [(11)C]CURB.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography with [(11)C]CURB was recently developed to quantify fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing the endocannabinoid anandamide. This study investigated the test-retest reliability of [(11)C]CURB as well as its in vivo specificity and the validity of the kinetic model by using the highly specific FAAH inhibitor, PF-04457845. Five healthy volunteers completed test-retest [(11)C]CURB scans 1 to 2 months apart and six subjects completed baseline and blocking scans on the same day after PF-04457845 (p.o.) administration (1, 4, or 20âmg; n=2 each). The composite parameter Î»k3 (an index of FAAH activity, Î»=K1/k2) was estimated using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model with plasma input function. There were no clinically observable responses to oral PF-04457845 or [(11)C]CURB injection. Oral administration of PF-04457845 reduced [(11)C]CURB binding to a homogeneous level at all three doses, with Î»k3 values decreased by â©¾91%. Excellent reproducibility and good reliability (test-retest variability=9%; intraclass correlation coefficient=0.79) were observed across all regions of interest investigated. Our findings suggest that Î»k3/[(11)C]CURB is a reliable, highly sensitive, and selective tool to measure FAAH activity in human brain in vivo. Moreover, PF-04457845 is a highly potent FAAH inhibitor (>95% inhibition at 1âmg) in living human brain.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 17 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.133.

Title #1676: Orientation Maps in V1 and Non-Euclidean Geometry.
PMID: 26082007
Authors: Alexandre A. Afgoustidis
Abstract: In the primary visual cortex, the processing of information uses the distribution of orientations in the visual input: neurons react to some orientations in the stimulus more than to others. In many species, orientation preference is mapped in a remarkable way on the cortical surface, and this organization of the neural population seems to be important for visual processing. Now, existing models for the geometry and development of orientation preference maps in higher mammals make a crucial use of symmetry considerations. In this paper, we consider probabilistic models for V1 maps from the point of view of group theory; we focus on Gaussian random fields with symmetry properties and review the probabilistic arguments that allow one to estimate pinwheel densities and predict the observed value of Ï. Then, in order to test the relevance of general symmetry arguments and to introduce methods which could be of use in modeling curved regions, we reconsider this model in the light of group representation theory, the canonical mathematics of symmetry. We show that through the Plancherel decomposition of the space of complex-valued maps on the Euclidean plane, each infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of the special Euclidean group yields a unique V1-like map, and we use representation theory as a symmetry-based toolbox to build orientation maps adapted to the most famous non-Euclidean geometries, viz. spherical and hyperbolic geometry. We find that most of the dominant traits of V1 maps are preserved in these; we also study the link between symmetry and the statistics of singularities in orientation maps, and show what the striking quantitative characteristics observed in animals become in our curved models.


Title #1677: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling in cancer: Alliance or contradiction? (Review).
PMID: 26082006
Authors: Hua-Fu HF. Zhao, Jing J. Wang, Shing-Shun SS. Tony To
Abstract: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway are responsible for regulating a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis. These two pathways are essential to the development and progression of tumors. The dual roles of JNK signaling in apoptosis and tumor development determine the different interactions between the PI3K/Akt and JNK pathways. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling can inhibit stress- and cytokine-induced JNK activation through Akt antagonizing and the formation of the JIP1-JNK module, as well as the activities of upstream kinases ASK1, MKK4/7 and MLK. On the other hand, hyperactivation of Akt and JNK is also found in cancers that harbor EGFR overexpression or loss of PTEN. Understanding the activation mechanism of PI3K/Akt and JNK pathways, as well as the interplays between these two pathways in cancer may contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In the present report, we summarized the current understanding of the PI3K/Akt and JNK signaling networks, as well as their biological roles in cancers. In addition, the interactions and regulatory network between PI3K/Akt and JNK pathways in cancer were discussed.


Title #1678: Drop-on-Demand System for Manufacturing of Melt-based Solid Oral Dosage: Effect of Critical Process Parameters on Product Quality.
PMID: 26082005
Authors: ElÃ§in E. IÃ§ten, Arun A. Giridhar, Zoltan K ZK. Nagy, Gintaras V GV. Reklaitis
Abstract: The features of a drop-on-demand-based system developed for the manufacture of melt-based pharmaceuticals have been previously reported. In this paper, a supervisory control system, which is designed to ensure reproducible production of high quality of melt-based solid oral dosages, is presented. This control system enables the production of individual dosage forms with the desired critical quality attributes: amount of active ingredient and drug morphology by monitoring and controlling critical process parameters, such as drop size and product and process temperatures. The effects of these process parameters on the final product quality are investigated, and the properties of the produced dosage forms characterized using various techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and dissolution testing. A crystallization temperature control strategy, including controlled temperature cycles, is presented to tailor the crystallization behavior of drug deposits and to achieve consistent drug morphology. This control strategy can be used to achieve the desired bioavailability of the drug by mitigating variations in the dissolution profiles. The supervisor control strategy enables the application of the drop-on-demand system to the production of individualized dosage required for personalized drug regimens.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, even despite use of oral anticoagulation (OAC). sST2 (Soluble Suppression of Tumorigenicity-2; IL1RL1 Interleukin-1 receptor-like-1) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. We assessed the predictive value of sST2 levels in an unselected "real world" cohort of anticoagulated AF patients.

Abstract: This study aimed to clarify the relationship between host nutritional status prior to first-line chemotherapy and therapeutic effect, and, whether these nourishment indexes could become factors that predict long-term convalescence in unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer or not. Summary of Background Date: It has previously been reported that postoperative complications and long-term prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies may be affected by their nutritional status. But, there is little information regarding the relationship between prognosis, nutritional status and immunocompetence in unresectable progressive or recurrent colorectal cancer.
