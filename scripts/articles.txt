Abstract: Objectives: Basaloid-squamous-carcinomas (BSCC) have been considered as aggressive variants of common squamous-cell-carcinomas (HNSCC). Recent studies demonstrated a different clinical course depending on the tumour site. The aim of the study is to analyze the histopathologic/clinical features of BSCC/HNSCC resolved by the HPV-status. Methods: We analysed the histopathologic/clinical features of BSCC (n=59) and HNSCC (n=981), subdivided due to the HPV status. Differences were analysed using Chi square, Fisher exact, and student's t-test. Survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. Prognostic variables were subsequently evaluated by Cox regression. Results: Our cohort was congruent with the literature regarding sex, age, metastases, and a predilection in the oropharynx. HNSCC/BSCC did not show a different disease-specific-survival. After UICC matching, univariate analysis revealed a better survival of UICC stage IVa BSCC compared to HNSCC (69% vs. 42%, p=0.022) that was associated with a better response to radio-chemotherapy (p = 0.009). These results referred to the high prevalence of HPV+ (86%) oropharyngeal BSCC. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a better survival of HPV+ oropharyngeal BSCC than HPV- BSCC (p=0.017). Conclusion: The clinical outcome in BSCC depends on the tumour site and HPV-status. Prospective studies have to evaluate the beneficial application of postoperative radio-chemotherapy in HPV+ BSCC.

Abstract: Medulloblastoma comprises four molecular subgroups of which Group 3 medulloblastoma is characterized by MYC amplification and MYC overexpression. Lymphoma cells expressing high levels of MYC are susceptible to apoptosis following treatment with inhibitors of mitosis. One of the key regulatory kinases involved in multiple stages of mitosis is Aurora kinase B. We hypothesized that medulloblastoma cells that overexpress MYC would be uniquely sensitized to the apoptotic effects of Aurora B inhibition. The specific inhibition of Aurora kinase B was achieved in MYC- overexpressing medulloblastoma cells with AZD1152-HQPA. MYC overexpression sensitized medulloblastoma cells to cell death upon Aurora B inhibition. This process was found to be independent of endoreplication. Using both flank and intracranial cerebellar xenografts we demonstrate that tumors formed from MYC-overexpressing medulloblastoma cells show a response to Aurora B inhibition including growth impairment and apoptosis induction. Lastly, we show the distribution of AZD1152-HQPA within the mouse brain and the ability to inhibit intracranial tumor growth and prolong survival in mice bearing tumors formed from MYC-overexpressing medulloblastoma cells. Our results suggest the potential for therapeutic application of Aurora kinase B inhibitors in the treatment of Group 3 medulloblastoma.


Title #3: Novel antigens in non-small cell lung cancer: SP17, AKAP4, and PTTG1 are potential immunotherapeutic targets.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both genders worldwide, with an incidence only second to prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The lethality of the disease highlights the urgent need for innovative therapeutic options. Immunotherapy can afford efficient and specific targeting of tumor cells, improving efficacy and reducing the side effects of current therapies. We have previously reported the aberrant expression of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) in tumors of unrelated histological origin. In this study we investigated the expression and immunogenicity of the CTAs, Sperm Protein 17 (SP17), A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) and Pituitary Tumor Transforming Gene 1 (PTTG1) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary tumors. We found that SP17, AKAP4 and PTTG1 are aberrantly expressed in cancer samples, compared to normal lung cell lines and tissues. We established the immunogenicity of these CTAs by measuring CTA-specific autoantibodies in patients' sera and generating CTA-specific autologous cytotoxic lymphocytes from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results provide proof of principle that the CTAs SP17/AKAP4/PTTG1 are expressed in both human NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors and can elicit an immunogenic response in lung cancer patients.


Title #4: Identification of a new class of natural product MDM2 inhibitor: In vitro and in vivo anti-breast cancer activities and target validation.

Abstract: The MDM2 oncogene has been suggested as a molecular target for treating human cancers, including breast cancer. Most MDM2 inhibitors under development are targeting the MDM2-p53 binding, and have little or no effects on cancers without functional p53, such as advanced breast cancer. The present study was designed to develop a new class of MDM2 inhibitors that exhibit anticancer activity in MDM2-dependent and p53-independent manners. The selective MDM2 inhibitors were discovered by a computational structure-based screening, yielding a lead compound, termed JapA. We further found that JapA inhibited cell growth, decreased cell proliferation, and induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells through an MDM2-dependent mechanism, regardless of p53 status. It also inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis in breast cancer xenograft models without causing any host toxicity. Furthermore, JapA directly bound to MDM2 protein and reduced MDM2 levels in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by promoting MDM2 protein degradation and inhibiting MDM2 transcription, which is distinct from the existing MDM2 inhibitors. In conclusion, JapA represents a new class of MDM2 inhibitor that exerts its anticancer activity through directly down-regulating MDM2, and might be developed as a novel cancer therapeutic agent.


Title #5: Breast Disease in Children and Adolescents.
PMID: 25739116
Authors: Teresa G TG. Odle
Abstract: Breast abnormalities and disease are rare in the young developing breast. Malignancy is even more uncommon. Yet evaluation and management of breast disease in infants, children, and adolescents requires a conservative approach to preserve developing structures and cosmetic appearance. Diagnosing breast disease in young patients can be made more difficult by developing breast anatomy, which is denser than adult breasts. In addition, ordering physicians, radiologists, and radiologic technologists must carefully consider the use of ionizing radiation in the diagnosis and management of pediatric breast disease.


Title #6: Dual-Energy Computed Tomography.
PMID: 25739115
Authors: Bryant B. Furlow
Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) yields precise anatomic and functional images by exploiting differences in the interactions of high- and low-energy photon spectra with different tissues' and materials' atomic components to more precisely differentiate the chemistry of tissues and disease processes than is possible with traditional single-energy CT scan acquisitions. This article introduces the history of DECT, its physical basis, scanner designs, radiation dose considerations, and postprocessing techniques. DECT's clinical applications also are described, and this relatively new imaging modality's clinical limitations and future prospects are discussed.


Title #7: Diagnosis and Treatment of Vertebral Compression Fractures.
PMID: 25739109
Authors: Cherie C. Dewar
Abstract: A healthy spine is an integral part of an individual's overall well-being. The spinal column's essential role in physiological and neurological function can be compromised when disease or trauma causes a vertebra to compress under the body's weight, producing a vertebral compression fracture. This is a common ailment among adults older than 65 years of age, especially for those with low bone mass or osteoporosis. This article describes vertebral compression fractures, with a special emphasis on medical imaging.


Title #8: Examining Suicide: Imaging's Contributions.
PMID: 25739108
Authors: Elizabeth J EJ. Church
Abstract: For many people, the death of hope leads inexorably to the conclusion that the only viable solution, the only way to put an end to unendurable pain, is suicide. What leads a person to commit this final, desperate act, and how might we predict, intervene, and prevent suicide? Health care workers, including radiologic technologists, can play an important role in detecting warning signs in patients and in better understanding what factors may lead to suicide. Although certain forms of suicide such as suicide bombings and assisted suicide are beyond its scope, this article explores medical imaging's contributions to the study of this phenomenon.


Title #9: Managing Clinical Education Through Understanding Key Principles.
PMID: 25739107
Authors: Joanne J. Cunningham, Caroline C. Wright, Marilyn M. Baird
Abstract: Traditionally, a practicum facilitated the integration of on-campus learning and practical workplace training. Over the past 3 decades, an educative practicum has evolved that promotes clinical reasoning, including analytical and evaluative abilities, through reflective practice. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the delivery of clinical education within medical radiation science entry-level programs continues to vacillate between traditional practicums and the new reflective practicums.

Title #11: Case Report: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome Diagnosed With Computed Tomography and Doppler Ultrasonography.
PMID: 25739105
Authors: Jennifer J. Bagley, Elliott E. Stamile, Jeff L JL. Berry, Dora D. DiGiacinto
Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome is a condition in which the median arcuate ligament crosses the aorta in a lower than normal position and compresses the celiac artery during respiration. The effects of compression are most notable during suspended expiration and when the patient is supine. Patients with median arcuate ligament syndrome present with postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and abdominal bruit. The compression leads to a narrowing of the artery, which could cause bowel ischemia, although this theory is controversial. Alternately, the median arcuate ligament could compress the celiac plexus, causing an inflammatory reaction from the nerves and producing a pain pattern that is similar to ischemia.

Abstract: The identification of genomic signatures that aid early identification of individuals at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the toddler period remains a major challenge because of the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder. Generally, ASD is not diagnosed before the fourth to fifth birthday.


Title #13: Understand, elucidate and rationalize the coordination mode of pyrimidylmethylamines: an intertwined study combining NMR and DFT methods.
PMID: 25739103

Abstract: Conception of new pyrimidylmethylamine (pyrma) ligands and their corresponding Pd(ii) complexes has been described. Both symmetrical and non-symmetrical ligands were prepared and subjected to complexation. Two different coordination modes, Pd(N,N)- or Pd(C,N,N)-pyrma, have been evidenced depending on the substitution of the pyrimidine ring and the nature or the shape of the additional pendant arm. In a non-symmetrical pyrimidine series, the substituent-induced discrimination of each heterocyclic nitrogen atom provoked regio-controlled coordination to the metal center. The molecular structure of pyrma-Pd(ii) complexes in the solution state has been elucidated thanks to combined NMR experiments and DFT calculations. This study highlights the potency of (15)N and (13)C NMR spectroscopy for the elucidation of the regio-selective coordination to the Pd(ii) in the pyrma-based complex series. DFT calculations were highly relevant to the identification of crucial factors that govern the regio-selectivity and the complexation modes. Close predicted and experimental chemical shift values put into relief the reliability of coordination modes for the most stable complexes in solution, depicted by DFT approaches.


Title #14: The role of mAKAPÎ² in the process of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II.
PMID: 25739102
Authors: Huixin H. Guo, Baoxin B. Liu, Lei L. Hou, Erlinda E. The, Gang G. Li, Dongzhi D. Wang, Qiqiang Q. Jie, Wenliang W. Che, Yidong Y. Wei
Abstract: AngiotensinÂ IIÂ (AngII) is the central product of the reninâangiotensin systemÂ (RAS) and this octapeptide contributes to the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. mAKAPÎ² is an Aâkinase anchoring proteinÂ (AKAP) that has the function of binding to the regulatory subunit of protein kinaseÂ AÂ (PKA) and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of mAKAPÎ² in AngIIâinduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the possible mechanisms involved. Cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats were treated with AngII. Subsequently, the morphology of the cardiomyocytes was observed and the expression of mAKAPÎ² and cardiomyocyte hypertrophic markers was measured. mAKAPÎ²âshRNA was constructed for RNA interference; the expression of mAKAPÎ² and hypertrophic markers, the cell surface area and the [3H]Leucine incorporation rate in the AngIIâtreated rat cardiomyocytes were detected following RNA interference. Simultaneously, changes in the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pâERK)2 in the cardiomyocytes were assessed. The cell size of the AngII-treated cardiaomyocytes was significantly larger than that of the untreated cardiomyocytes. The expression of hypertrophic markers and pâERK2, the cell surface area and the [3H]Leucine incorporation rate were all significantly increased in the AngIIâtreated cells. However, the expression of mAKAPÎ² remained unaltered in this process. RNA interference simultaneously inhibited the protein expression of mAKAPÎ² and pâERK2, and the hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes induced by AngII was attenuated. These results demonstrate that AngII induces hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, and mAKAPÎ² is possibly involved in this process. The effects of mAKAPÎ² on AngIIâinduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy may be associated with pâERK2 expression.


Title #15: MicroRNA-377 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Invasion by Inhibiting TIAM1 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PMID: 25739101
Authors: Guolin G. Chen, Lu L. Lu, Chang C. Liu, Lei L. Shan, Di D. Yuan
Abstract: Increasing evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we identified a novel tumor suppressive miRNA, miR-377, and investigated its role in HCC. The expression of miR-377 in HCC tissues and cell lines was detected by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. The effects of miR-377 on HCC cell proliferation and invasion were also investigated. Western blot and luciferase reporter assay were used to identify the direct and functional target of miR-377. The expression of miR-377 was markedly downregulated in human HCC tissues and cell lines. MiR-377 can dramatically inhibit cell growth and invasion in HCC cells. Subsequent investigation revealed that T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) was a direct and functional target of miR-377 in HCC cells. Overexpression of miR-377 impaired TIAM1-induced promotion of proliferation and invasion in HCC cells. Finally, miR-377 is inversely correlated with TIAM1 expression in human HCC tissues. These findings reveal that miR-377 functions as a tumor suppressor and inhibits the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells by targeting TIAM1, which may consequently serve as a therapeutic target for HCC patients.


Title #16: Polymorphisms in MicroRNA Target Sites of Forkhead Box O Genes Are Associated with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PMID: 25739100
Authors: Chao C. Tan, Shun S. Liu, Shengkui S. Tan, Xiaoyun X. Zeng, Hongping H. Yu, Anhua A. Li, Chunhua C. Bei, Xiaoqiang X. Qiu
Abstract: The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors play important roles in various cancer development including Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). In this study we conducted a hospital-based case control study including 1049 cases (HCC patients) and 1052 controls (non-tumor patients) to examine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within microRNA (miRNA) target sites of FOXO genes confer HCC susceptibility. A total of three miRNA target site SNPs in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of FOXO1 (rs17592236), FOXO3 (rs4946936) and FOXO4 (rs4503258) were analyzed. No statistically significant differences were found in genotype distribution for rs17592236, rs4946936, and rs4503258 between the HCC patient group and the tumor-free control group using single factor chi-square analysis (P>0.05). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the CT/TT genotype in rs17592236 was significantly associated with decreased risk of HCC development (P = 0.010, OR = 0.699, 95% CI: 0.526-0.927) as compared to the CC genotype in rs17592236. Additionally, a genetic interaction was found between rs17592236 and rs4503258 (P = 0.003, OR = 0.755, 95% CI: 0.628-0.908). Functional dual luciferase reporter assays verified that the rs17592236 SNP was a target site of human miRNA miR-137. Together, these results indicate that the rs17592236 polymorphism is associated with decreasing of HCC hereditary susceptibility likely through modulating the binding affinity of miR-137 to the 3'UTR in FOXO1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Further knowledge obtained from this study may provide important evidence for the prevention and targeted therapy of HCC.


Title #17: A Rapid Molecular Approach for Chromosomal Phasing.

Abstract: Determining the chromosomal phase of pairs of sequence variants - the arrangement of specific alleles as haplotypes - is a routine challenge in molecular genetics. Here we describe Drop-Phase, a molecular method for quickly ascertaining the phase of pairs of DNA sequence variants (separated by 1-200 kb) without cloning or manual single-molecule dilution. In each Drop-Phase reaction, genomic DNA segments are isolated in tens of thousands of nanoliter-sized droplets together with allele-specific fluorescence probes, in a single reaction well. Physically linked alleles partition into the same droplets, revealing their chromosomal phase in the co-distribution of fluorophores across droplets. We demonstrated the accuracy of this method by phasing members of trios (revealing 100% concordance with inheritance information), and demonstrate a common clinical application by phasing CFTR alleles at genomic distances of 11-116 kb in the genomes of cystic fibrosis patients. Drop-Phase is rapid (requiring less than 4 hours), scalable (to hundreds of samples), and effective at long genomic distances (200 kb).


Title #18: Attenuation of enoyl coenzymeÂ A hydrataseÂ 1 expression in colorectal cancer cells using small interferingÂ RNA inhibits cell proliferation and migration.
PMID: 25739098
Authors: Qing-Mei QM. Zhao, Fei F. Kuang, Han H. Wu, Yu-Hao YH. Zhang
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer and is a leading cause of cancerâassociated mortality worldwide. Short chain enoyl coenzymeÂ A hydrataseÂ 1Â (ECHS1) is an important gene involved in the mitochondrial fatty acid Î²âoxidation pathway. In addition, ECHS1 has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, colon and liver cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of ECHS1 in the human HCTâ8 colorectal cancer cell line. The results showed that ECHS1 expression was significantly increased in poorlyâdifferentiated cells compared with that in wellâdifferentiated cells. In order to further investigate the functions of ECHS1 in colorectal cancer cells, a stably transfected HCTâ8 cell line expressing small interferingÂ (si)RNA targeting the ECHS1 gene was established. The expression of the ECHS1 siRNA was found to reduce ECHS1 protein levels in ECHS1âsilenced cells by >40%. Cell proliferation and cell migration of the siECHS1 cells were characterized using Cell Counting Kitâ8 and Transwell assays, respectively, the results of which showed that the constitutive knockdown of the ECSH1 gene in HCTâ8 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, decreased levels of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3Î² phosphorylation were observed in ECHS1âsilenced HCTâ8 cells compared with that of parental or pU6 empty vectorâtransfected cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that ECHS1 may have an important role in colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration via activation of Aktâ and GSK3Î²âassociated signaling pathways.


Title #19: Preconception and Prenatal Environmental Factors Associated with Communication Impairments in 9 Year Old Children Using an Exposome-Wide Approach.
PMID: 25739097
Authors: Colin D CD. Steer, Patrick P. Bolton, Jean J. Golding
Abstract: Although speech and language deficits are common in children and strongly associated with poor educational and social outcomes, little attention has been paid to the antecedents. In this study we used the information from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to examine preconception and prenatal environmental risk factors that were related to communication difficulties in children using the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC). We used an exposome-wide approach to identify environmental factors univariably associated with the CCC. Taking account of the False Discovery rate, we used a P value of 0.000157 to identify 621 of 3855 items tested. These were then subjected to a series of stepwise linear regression analyses, firstly within 10 domains: personal characteristics, health, development, education, socio-economic variables, lifestyle, home and social environments, life events and chemical and other exposures; and then with the predictive variables from each domain. The final model consisted of 19 variables independently associated with the communication scale. These variables suggested 6 possible mechanisms: stressors primarily associated with socio-economic disadvantage although other lifestyle choices such as a social network of family or friends can ameliorate these effects; indicators of future parenting skills primarily associated with aspects of parental personality; aspects of the home environment; poor maternal health with a novel finding concerning maternal hearing loss; and maternal education which was partially mediated by the child's IQ. Finally, there may be a mechanism via the maternal diet in pregnancy in particular the consumption of fatty or processed foods. This is the subject of ongoing investigation.


Title #20: Rapid screening for the adulterants of Berberis aristata using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry and principal component analysis for discrimination.
PMID: 25739096
Authors: Vikas V. Bajpai, Awantika A. Singh, K R KR. Arya, Mukesh M. Srivastatva, Brijesh B. Kumar
Abstract: Adulteration or substitution of commercial Berberis aristata and its herbal products with inferior quality substituents is very common. Metabolic profiling of Berberis aristata, along with its common adulterants/contaminants/substituents like Berberis asiatica, Mahonia borealis and Coscinium fenestratum was rapidly carried out using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry to generate the chemical fingerprints for the differentiation of these species. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of mainly alkaloids. The identified alkaloids were berberrubine, berberine, jatrorrhizine, ketoberberine, palmatine, dihydropalmatine or 7,8-dihydro-8-hydroxyberberine, berbamine and pakistanamine. Berberine which was mainly reported from root and stem bark of B. aristata was also identified in leaf along with the chlorogenic acid. The DART MS data has been subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting score plots showed clustering and clear differentiation of the species and plant parts. It is thus apparent that the technique of DART MS followed by PCA is a quick and reliable method for the direct profiling of B. aristata and their adulterant plant and plant parts. The study reports the rapid analytical method to identify the possibility of illegal adulteration/contamination/substitution in the potential plant materials and herbal extracts.


Title #21: Prevalence of Learned Grapheme-Color Pairings in a Large Online Sample of Synesthetes.
PMID: 25739095
Authors: Nathan N. Witthoft, Jonathan J. Winawer, David M DM. Eagleman
Abstract: In this paper we estimate the minimum prevalence of grapheme-color synesthetes with letter-color matches learned from an external stimulus, by analyzing a large sample of English-speaking grapheme-color synesthetes. We find that at least 6% (400/6588 participants) of the total sample learned many of their matches from a widely available colored letter toy. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-color pairings approaches 15% for some 5-year periods. Among those born 5 years or more before it was manufactured, none have colors learned from the toy. Analysis of the letter-color matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus. These data indicate learning of letter-color pairings from external contingencies can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetes, and are consistent with the hypothesis that grapheme-color synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.


Title #22: The crystal structure and upconversion properties of Yb(3+), Er(3+)/Ho(3+) codoped BaLiF3 microcrystals with different morphologies.
PMID: 25739094
Authors: Qinping Q. Qiang, Wenbo W. Chen, Xinlong X. Ma, Yuhua Y. Wang
Abstract: A series of x mol% Yb(3+), 1 mol% Ho(3+)/1 mol% Er(3+) (0 â¤ x â¤ 25) codoped BaLiF3 microcrystals with different cubic morphologies and sizes (1.52 Î¼m-3.83 Î¼m) were synthesized by a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal-microemulsion approach for the first time. The crystalline structure of BaLiF3 was established via the Rietveld refinement result of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. In addition, the growth process of cubic BaLiF3 crystals and the influence of different synthesis conditions on the morphology were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, in this paper we first investigated the upconversion luminescence (UCL) properties of new Er(3+)/Ho(3+), Yb(3+)-codoped BaLiF3 microcrystals under 980 nm excitation. The characteristic emission of Er(3+) and Ho(3+) was obtained, respectively. The blue emission in BaLiF3:Yb(3+), Ho(3+) which was comparatively more difficult to discover was also observed and explained by the energy level diagram. It is worthwhile to point out that BaLiF3:Yb(3+), Er(3+) practically showed pure red upconversion (UC) emission under excitation at 980 nm and the reasons behind this behavior are presented and discussed.

Title #24: Relationship between Antibody Susceptibility and Lipopolysaccharide O-Antigen Characteristics of Invasive and Gastrointestinal Nontyphoidal Salmonellae Isolates from Kenya.
PMID: 25739091

Abstract: Nontyphoidal Salmonellae (NTS) cause a large burden of invasive and gastrointestinal disease among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. No vaccine is currently available. Previous reports indicate the importance of the O-antigen of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide for virulence and resistance to antibody-mediated killing. We hypothesised that isolates with more O-antigen have increased resistance to antibody-mediated killing and are more likely to be invasive than gastrointestinal.


Title #25: Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Differential Gene Expressions for Cell Growth and Functional Secondary Metabolites in Induced Autotetraploid of Chinese Woad (Isatis indigotica Fort.).
PMID: 25739089
Authors: Yingying Y. Zhou, Lei L. Kang, Shiying S. Liao, Qi Q. Pan, Xianhong X. Ge, Zaiyun Z. Li
Abstract: The giant organs and enhanced concentrations of secondary metabolites realized by autopolyploidy are attractive for breeding the respective medicinal and agricultural plants and studying the genetic mechanisms. The traditional medicinal plant Chinese woad (Isatis indigotica Fort., 2n = 2x = 14) is now still largely used for the diseases caused by bacteria and viruses in China. In this study, its autopolyploids (3x, 4x) were produced and characterized together with the 2x donor for their phenotype and transcriptomic alterations by using high-throughput RNA sequencing. With the increase of genome dosage, the giantism in cells and organs was obvious and the photosynthetic rate was higher. The 4x plants showed predominantly the normal meiotic chromosome pairing (bivalents and quadrivalents) and equal segregation and then produced the majority of 4x progeny. The total 70136 All-unigenes were de novo assembled, and 56,482 (80.53%) unigenes were annotated based on BLASTx searches of the public databases. From pair-wise comparisons between transcriptomic data of 2x, 3x, 4x plants, 1856 (2.65%)(2x vs 4x), 693(0.98%)(2x vs 3x), 1045(1.48%)(3x vs 4x) unigenes were detected to differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including both up- and down-regulated ones. These DEGs were mainly involved in cell growth (synthesis of expansin and pectin), cell wall organization, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, response to stress and photosynthetic pathways. The up-regulation of some DEGs for metabolic pathways of functional compounds in the induced autotetraploids substantiates the promising new type of this medicinal plant with the increased biomass and targeted metabolites.


Title #26: Filter-Dense Multicolor Microscopy.
PMID: 25739088
Authors: Siavash S. Kijani, Ulf U. Yrlid, Maria M. Heyden, Malin M. Levin, Jan J. BorÃ©n, Per P. Fogelstrand
Abstract: Immunofluorescence microscopy is a unique method to reveal the spatial location of proteins in tissues and cells. By combining antibodies that are labeled with different fluorochromes, the location of several proteins can simultaneously be visualized in one sample. However, because of the risk of bleed-through signals between fluorochromes, standard multicolor microscopy is restricted to a maximum of four fluorescence channels, including one for nuclei staining. This is not always enough to address common scientific questions. In particular, the use of a rapidly increasing number of marker proteins to classify functionally distinct cell populations and diseased tissues emphasizes the need for more complex multistainings. Hence, multicolor microscopy should ideally offer more channels to meet the current needs in biomedical science. Here we present an enhanced multi-fluorescence setup, which we call Filter-Dense Multicolor Microscopy (FDMM). FDMM is based on condensed filter sets that are more specific for each fluorochrome and allow a more economic use of the light spectrum. FDMM allows at least six independent fluorescence channels and can be applied to any standard fluorescence microscope without changing any operative procedures for the user. In the present study, we demonstrate an FDMM setup of six channels that includes the most commonly used fluorochromes for histology. We show that the FDMM setup is specific and robust, and we apply the technique on typical biological questions that require more than four fluorescence microscope channels.

Abstract: The production and uptake of yolk protein play an important role in the reproduction of all oviparous organisms. Vitellogenin (Vg) is the precursor of vitellin (Vn), which is the major egg storage protein, and vitellogenin receptor (VgR) is a necessary protein for the uptake of Vg into developing oocytes. In this paper, we characterize the full-length Vg and VgR, PcVg1 and PcVgR, respectively, of the citrus red mite Panonychus citri (McGregor). The PcVg1 cDNA is 5748 nucleotides (nt) with a 5553-nt open reading frame (ORF) coding for 1851 amino acids (aa), and the PcVgR is 6090 nt, containing an intact ORF of 5673 nt coding an expected protein of 1891 aa. The PcVg1 aa sequence shows a typical GLCG domain and several K/RXXR cleavage sites, and PcVgR comprises two ligand-binding domains, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions containing YWTD motifs, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. An analysis of the aa sequences and phylogenetics implied that both genes were genetically distinct from those of ticks and insects. The transcriptional profiles determined by real-time quantitative PCR in different developmental stages showed that both genes present the same expressional tendencies in eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults. This suggested that the biosynthesis and uptake of PcVg occurs coordinately. The strong reproductive capacity of P. citri has been hypothesized as an important factor in its resistance; consequently, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating Vg and VgR are fundamental for mite control.


Title #28: Transcriptome Analysis in Rat Kidneys: Importance of Genes Involved in Programmed Hypertension.
PMID: 25739086

Abstract: Suboptimal conditions in pregnancy can elicit long-term effects on the health of offspring. The most common outcome is programmed hypertension. We examined whether there are common genes and pathways in the kidney are responsible for generating programmed hypertension among three different models using next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received dexamethasone (DEX, 0.1 mg/kg) from gestational day 16 to 22, 60% high-fructose (HF) diet, or NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyester (l-NAME, 60 mg/kg/day) to conduct DEX, HF, or l-NAME model respectively. All three models elicited programmed hypertension in adult male offspring. We observed five shared genes (Bcl6, Dmrtc1c, Egr1, Inmt, and Olr1668) among three different models. The identified differential genes (DEGs) that are related to regulation of blood pressure included Aqp2, Ptgs1, Eph2x, Hba-a2, Apln, Guca2b, Hmox1, and Npy. RNA-Seq identified genes in arachidonic acid metabolism are potentially gatekeeper genes contributing to programmed hypertension. In addition, HF and DEX increased expression and activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase (Ephx2 gene encoding protein). Conclusively, the DEGs in arachidonic acid metabolism are potentially gatekeeper genes in programmed hypertension. The roles of DEGs identified by the RNA-Seq in this study deserve further clarification, to develop the potential interventions in the prevention of programmed hypertension.


Title #29: Discovery of a Potent Anti-Yeast Triterpenoid Saponin, Clematoside-S from Urena lobata L.

Abstract: Urena lobata has been used as a traditional medicinal plant in India and China. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity and isolated the active compound from the leaves of U. lobata. The 80% ethanol extract from U. lobata leaves showed an effective anti-yeast activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) strains. Using a combination of chromatographic methods, (-)-trachelogenin (1) and clematoside-S (2) were isolated from this plant for the first time, and their chemical structure was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data analysis. In addition, 1 was found to be inactive against all of the test microorganisms in the antimicrobial assay, whereas 2 exhibits a specific anti-yeast activity against S. cerevisiae strains with diameter of inhibition zones in the range from 11 to 20 mm. Furthermore, the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values of 2 against S. cerevisiae strains were detected to be in the ranges of 0.61 to 9.8 Î¼g/mL and 2.42 to 9.8 Î¼g/mL, respectively. This is the first report of 2 with a specific anti-yeast activity. The above result suggests the potential application of U. lobata to be used as a natural anti-yeast agent in food preservation.


Title #30: Proteome Analysis of Dormancy-Released Seeds of Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. in Response to Re-Dehydration under Different Conditions.

Abstract: Desiccation tolerance is the ability of orthodox seeds to achieve equilibrium with atmospheric relative humidity and to survive in this state. Understanding how orthodox seeds respond to dehydration is important for improving quality and long-term storage of seeds under low temperature and drought stress conditions. Long-term storage of seeds is an artificial situation, because in most natural situations a seed that has been shed may not remain in a desiccated state for very long, and if dormant it may undergo repeated cycles of hydration. Different types of seeds are differentially sensitive to desiccation and this directly affects long-term storage. For these reasons, many researchers are investigating loss of desiccation tolerance during orthodox seed development to understand how it is acquired. In this study, the orthodox seed proteome response of Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. to dehydration (to a relative water content of 10%, which mimics seed dehydration) was investigated under four different conditions viz. 20 Â°C; 20 Â°C with silica gel; 1 Â°C; and 1 Â°C after pretreatment with Ca2+. Proteins from seeds dehydrated under different conditions were extracted and separated by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). A total of 2919 protein spots were detected, and high-resolution 2D-DIGE indicated there were 27 differentially expressed. Seven of these were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Inferences from bioinformatics annotations of these proteins established the possible involvement of detoxifying enzymes, transport proteins, and nucleotide metabolism enzymes in response to dehydration. Of the seven differentially abundant proteins, the amounts of six were down-regulated and one was up-regulated. Also, a putative acyl-coenzyme A oxidase of the glyoxylate cycle increased in abundance. In particular, the presence of kinesin-1, a protein important for regulation and cargo interaction, was up-regulated in seeds exposed to low temperature dehydration. Kinesin-1 is present in all major lineages, but it is rarely detected in seed desiccation tolerance of woody species. These observations provide new insight into the proteome of seeds in deep dormancy under different desiccation conditions.


Title #31: Knockdown of UbcH10 Enhances the Chemosensitivity of Dual Drug Resistant Breast Cancer Cells to Epirubicin and Docetaxel.
PMID: 25739083

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers in women. As a hub gene involved in a diversity of tumors, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H10 (UbcH10), may also play some roles in the genesis and development of breast cancer. In the current study, we found that the expression of UbcH10 was up-regulated in some breast cancer tissues and five cell lines. We established a dual drug resistant cell line MCF-7/EPB (epirubicin)/TXT (docetaxel) and a lentiviral system expressing UbcH10 shRNA to investigate the effects of UbcH10 knockdown on the chemosensitivity of MCF-7/EPB/TXT cells to epirubicin and docetaxel. The knockdown of UbcH10 inhibited the proliferation of both MCF-7 and MCF-7/EPB/TXT cells, due to the G1 phase arrest in cell cycle. Furthermore, UbcH10 knockdown increased the sensitivity of MCF-7/EPB/TXT cells to epirubicin and docetaxel and promoted the apoptosis induced by these two drugs. Protein detection showed that, in addition to inhibiting the expression of Ki67 and cyclin D1, UbcH10 RNAi also impaired the increased BCL-2 and MDR-1 expression levels in MCF-7/EPB/TXT cells, which may contribute to abating the drug resistance in the breast cancer cells. Our research in the current study demonstrated that up-regulation of UbcH10 was involved in breast cancer and its knockdown can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and increase the chemosensitivity of the dual drug resistant breast cancer cells to epirubicin and docetaxel, suggesting that UbcH10 may be a promising target for the therapy of breast cancer.


Title #32: The Anti-TNF-Î± Antibody Infliximab Inhibits the Expression of Fat-Transporter-Protein FAT/CD36 in a Selective Hepatic-Radiation Mouse Model.
PMID: 25739082

Abstract: Previously, we reported a radiation-induced inflammation triggering fat-accumulation through fatty-acid-translocase/cluster of differentiation protein 36 (FAT/CD36) in rat liver. Furthermore, inhibition of radiation-induced FAT/CD36-expression by anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î± (anti-TNF-Î±) (infliximab) was shown in vitro. The current study investigates fat-accumulation in a mouse-model of single-dose liver-irradiation (25-Gray) and the effect of anti-TNF-Î±-therapy on FAT/CD36 gene-expression. Mice livers were selectively irradiated in vivo in presence or absence of infliximab. Serum- and hepatic-triglycerides, mRNA, and protein were analyzed by colorimetric assays, RT-PCR, Immunofluorescence and Western-Blot, respectively. Sudan-staining was used demonstrating fat-accumulation in tissue. In mice livers, early (1-3 h) induction of TNF-Î±-expression, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was observed. It was followed by elevated hepatic-triglyceride level (6-12 h), compared to sham-irradiated controls. In contrast, serum-triglyceride level was decreased at these time points. Similar to triglyceride level in mice livers, Sudan staining of liver cryosections showed a quick (6-12 h) increase of fat-droplets after irradiation. Furthermore, expression of fat-transporter-protein FAT/CD36 was increased at protein level caused by radiation or TNF-Î±. TNF-Î±-blockage by anti-TNF-Î± showed an early inhibition of radiation-induced FAT/CD36 expression in mice livers. Immunohistochemistry showed basolateral and cytoplasmic expression of FAT/CD36 in hepatocytes. Moreover, co-localization of FAT/CD36 was detected with Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA+) cells and F4/80+ macrophages. In summary, hepatic-radiation triggers fat-accumulation in mice livers, involving acute-phase-processes. Accordingly, anti-TNF-Î±-therapy prevented early radiation-induced expression of FAT/CD36 in vivo.

Abstract: Dental pulp tissue supports the vitality of the tooth, but it is particularly vulnerable to external insults, such as mechanical trauma, chemical irritation or microbial invasion, which can lead to tissue necrosis. In the present work, we present an endodontic regeneration method based on the use of a tridimensional (3D) hyaluronan scaffold and human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to produce a functional dental pulp-like tissue in vitro. An enriched population of DPSCs was seeded onto hyaluronan-based non-woven meshes in the presence of differentiation factors to induce the commitment of stem cells to neuronal, glial, endothelial and osteogenic phenotypes. In vitro experiments, among which were gene expression profiling and immunofluorescence (IF) staining, proved the commitment of DPSCs to the main components of dental pulp tissue. In particular, the hyaluronan-DPSCs construct showed a dental pulp-like morphology consisting of several specialized cells growing inside the hyaluronan fibers. Furthermore, these constructs were implanted into rat calvarial critical-size defects. Histological analyses and gene expression profiling performed on hyaluronan-DPSCs grafts showed the regeneration of osteodentin-like tissue. Altogether, these data suggest the regenerative potential of the hyaluronan-DPSC engineered tissue.


Title #34: Nerve Demyelination Increases Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Subtype 5 Expression in Peripheral Painful Mononeuropathy.
PMID: 25739080
Authors: Miau-Hwa MH. Ko, Yu-Lin YL. Hsieh, Sung-Tsang ST. Hsieh, To-Jung TJ. Tseng
Abstract: Wallerian degeneration or nerve demyelination, arising from spinal nerve compression, is thought to bring on chronic neuropathic pain. The widely distributed metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is involved in modulating nociceptive transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of mGluR5 on peripheral hypersensitivities after chronic constriction injury (CCI). Sprague-Dawley rats were operated on with four loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve to induce thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Primary afferents in dermis after CCI exhibited progressive decreases, defined as partial cutaneous denervation; importantly, mGluR5 expressions in primary afferents were statistically increased. CCI-induced neuropathic pain behaviors through the intraplantar injections of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a selective mGluR5 antagonist, were dose-dependently attenuated. Furthermore, the most increased mGluR5 expressions in primary afferents surrounded by reactive Schwann cells were observed at the distal CCI stumps of sciatic nerves. In conclusion, these results suggest that nerve demyelination results in the increases of mGluR5 expression in injured primary afferents after CCI; and further suggest that mGluR5 represents a main therapeutic target in developing pharmacological strategies to prevent peripheral hypersensitivities.


Title #35: Chloroplast-Expressed MSI-99 in Tobacco Improves Disease Resistance and Displays Inhibitory Effect against Rice Blast Fungus.
PMID: 25739079
Authors: Yun-Peng YP. Wang, Zheng-Yi ZY. Wei, Yu-Ying YY. Zhang, Chun-Jing CJ. Lin, Xiao-Fang XF. Zhong, Yue-Lin YL. Wang, Jing-Yong JY. Ma, Jian J. Ma, Shao-Chen SC. Xing
Abstract: Rice blast is a major destructive fungal disease that poses a serious threat to rice production and the improvement of blast resistance is critical to rice breeding. The antimicrobial peptide MSI-99 has been suggested as an antimicrobial peptide conferring resistance to bacterial and fungal diseases. Here, a vector harboring the MSI-99 gene was constructed and introduced into the tobacco chloroplast genome via particle bombardment. Transformed plants were obtained and verified to be homoplastomic by PCR and Southern hybridization. In planta assays demonstrated that the transgenic tobacco plants displayed an enhanced resistance to the fungal disease. The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity revealed that the crude protein extracts from the transgenic plants manifested an antimicrobial activity against E. coli, even after incubation at 120 Â°C for 20 min, indicating significant heat stability of MSI-99. More importantly, the MSI-99-containing protein extracts were firstly proved in vitro and in vivo to display significant suppressive effects on two rice blast isolates. These findings provide a strong basis for the development of new biopesticides to combat rice blast.


Title #36: Methods for Biomimetic Remineralization of Human Dentine: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 25739078
Authors: Chris Ying CY. Cao, May Lei ML. Mei, Quan-Li QL. Li, Edward Chin Man EC. Lo, Chun Hung CH. Chu
Abstract: This study aimed to review the laboratory methods on biomimetic remineralization of demineralized human dentine. A systematic search of the publications in the PubMed, TRIP, and Web of Science databases was performed. Titles and abstracts of initially identified publications were screened. Clinical trials, reviews, non-English articles, resin-dentine interface studies, hybrid layer studies, hybrid scaffolds studies, and irrelevant studies were excluded. The remaining papers were retrieved with full texts. Manual screening was conducted on the bibliographies of remaining papers to identify relevant articles. A total of 716 studies were found, and 690 were excluded after initial screening. Two articles were identified from the bibliographies of the remaining papers. After retrieving the full text, 23 were included in this systematic review. Sixteen studies used analogues to mimic the functions of non-collagenous proteins in biomineralization of dentine, and four studies used bioactive materials to induce apatite formation on demineralized dentine surface. One study used zinc as a bioactive element, one study used polydopamine, and another study constructed an agarose hydrogel system for biomimetic mineralization of dentine. Many studies reported success in biomimetic mineralization of dentine, including the use of non-collagenous protein analogues, bioactive materials, or elements and agarose hydrogel system.


Title #37: Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia.
PMID: 25739077
Authors: Keiichi K. Matsubara, Takashi T. Higaki, Yuko Y. Matsubara, Akihiro A. Nawa
Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by disturbed extravillous trophoblast migration toward uterine spiral arteries leading to increased uteroplacental vascular resistance and by vascular dysfunction resulting in reduced systemic vasodilatory properties. Its pathogenesis is mediated by an altered bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and tissue damage caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, superoxide (O2-) rapidly inactivates NO and forms peroxynitrite (ONOO-). It is known that ONOO- accumulates in the placental tissues and injures the placental function in PE. In addition, ROS could stimulate platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to intravascular coagulopathy. ROS-induced coagulopathy causes placental infarction and impairs the uteroplacental blood flow in PE. The disorders could lead to the reduction of oxygen and nutrients required for normal fetal development resulting in fetal growth restriction. On the other hand, several antioxidants scavenge ROS and protect tissues against oxidative damage. Placental antioxidants including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) protect the vasculature from ROS and maintain the vascular function. However, placental ischemia in PE decreases the antioxidant activity resulting in further elevated oxidative stress, which leads to the appearance of the pathological conditions of PE including hypertension and proteinuria. Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between ROS and antioxidant activity. This review provides new insights about roles of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PE.


Title #38: Anti-metastatic effects of DNA vaccine encoding singleâchain trimer composed of MHC I and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 peptide.
PMID: 25739076

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptorÂ 2 (VEGFR2)-mediated signaling is the key rate-limiting step in angiogenesis. VEGFR2 serves as the most important target of anti-angiogenic therapy for cancers. Singleâchain trimer (SCT) comprising antigen peptide, Î²2-microglobulin (Î²2m), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classÂ I heavy chain was a particularly powerful strategy involved in the increase of the potency of DNA vaccine against tumors and infections. In the present study, we constructed an SCT-encoding VEGFR2 antigen peptide [aa400-408, also known as kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR2)], Î²2m, and mouse MHC classÂ I heavy chain H-2Db [pcDNA3.1(+)-KDR2-Î²2mâH-2Db, or SCT-KDR2]. The constructed SCT-KDR2 DNA was efficiently expressed in the human A293 embryonic kidney cell line. Intradermal immunization of C57BL/6 mice with SCT-KDR2 DNA was able to successfully break self-immunological tolerance and induce robust cytotoxic Tâlymphocyte (CTL) response to VEGFR2, leading to marked suppression of tumor cellâinduced angiogenesis and metastasis in murine models of B16 melanoma and 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma. Taken together, the results showed that VEGFR2-targeted SCT vaccination is an effective modality that can be utilized in anti-angiogenic active immunotherapy for various types of cancer.


Title #39: Immune regulatory cells and IL17-producing lymphocytes in patients with benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.
PMID: 25739075

Abstract: The relationship between salivary gland tumors and immune system has not been well inspected. We aimed to investigate the distribution of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)regulatory T (Treg) cells, CTLA4(+)CD4(+)lymphocytes, as well asIL-17 producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) (Th17 and Tc17) lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with benign and malignant salivary gland tumors and a group of healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 27 patients with salivary gland tumors (19 benign and 8 malignant; mean age of 49.2Â±18.3), as well as19 age/sex matched healthy donors. Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were used to stain the cell surface markers, as well as intracellular molecules following cell-membrane fixation and permeabilization. The stained cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur four-color flowcytometer and analyzed by CellQuest Pro software package. The data were presented as mean percentagesÂ±SEM. Results indicated that the patients with malignant salivary gland tumors have increased percentage of Treg cells (7.74Â±1.1) and intracellular CTLA4 (inCTLA4)-positive CD4(+)lymphocytes (8.18Â±1.77) in comparison to the patients with benign tumors (4.38Â±0.56 for Treg cells and 3.83Â±0.56 for CTLA4(+)CD4(+) cells), as well as control subjects (2.34Â±0.28 for Treg cells and 2.22Â±0.25 for CTLA4(+)CD4(+) cells) (pâ¤0.001). Conversely these patients had reduced percentage of Th17 cells (0.84Â±0.14) comparing to the patients with benign tumors(2.09Â±0.31)as well as control subjects (2.31Â±0.23) (pâ¤0.001).In addition, the ratio of Th17/Treg lymphocytes was significantly lower in both malignant (0.12Â±0.03) and benign (0.48Â±0.09) tumors in comparison to control subjects (1.26Â±0.23) (p<0.001). The mean percentage of Tc17 cells in patients with benign (1.14Â±0.15) and malignant (0.60Â±0.13) tumors was nearly similar to those in control subjects (0.83Â±0.14) but the mean expression intensityofIL-17 by these cells was significantly higher in patients with malignant tumors (11.06Â±1.26) than controls (7.61Â±0.69) (p=0.01). Increase in the prevalence of regulatory lymphocytes, Treg cells and CTLA4+CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as the imbalance of Th17/Treg ratio may suggest the contribution of these immune effector cells in the progression of salivary gland tumors. From immune-regulatory point of view, these data also suggest that benign salivary gland tumors might fall between healthy and malignant conditions. The immunity to salivary gland tumors, as well as the findings presented here merits more in-depth investigation.


Title #40: A simple method to adjust the morphology of gradient three-dimensional PTB7-Th:PC71BM polymer solar cells.
PMID: 25739074
Authors: Ling L. Zhao, Suling S. Zhao, Zheng Z. Xu, Qianqian Q. Yang, Di D. Huang, Xurong X. Xu
Abstract: Multiple interfaces are necessary for exciton separation in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and continuous pathways for carrier transportation in donorâ:âacceptor blend films, especially along the vertical direction, for efficient charge collection. Therefore film morphology is critically important to satisfy both in the construction of high performance organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the cooperative effect of solvent additives and solvent flux treatment on film morphology was confirmed. Furthermore, the correlation between a single processing parameter and the resulting morphology has been investigated. Our results show that film morphology can be tuned by changing the volume fraction of the solvent additive. Beyond that, after methanol fluxing, the OSC performance improves significantly, as short circuit current density (JSC) increases from 13.85 mA cm(-2) to 15.17 mA cm(-2) and fill factor (FF) from 62.9% to 65.7%, simultaneously. As a result, power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 6.79% to 7.67%. The favorable morphology was further investigated using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).


Title #41: [Normative Data of Pharyngeal and Upper Esophageal Sphincter High Resolution Manometry.]
PMID: 25739072
Authors: M. M. Jungheim, C. C. Schubert, S. S. Miller, M. M. Ptok
Abstract: Background: High resolution manometry (HRM) can provide information about the muscular contraction of the pharynx and the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and represents an important tool in the diagnostics of dysphagia. To compare the results of swallowing studies interindividually and to identify pathological swallows, normative data are necessary. Normative data for the use of an HRM-probe with a large diameter has already been published. As previously has been shown these probes can influence the normal contraction of the pharynx and the UES. In this study comprehensive normal values are presented for small HRM-probes in diameter (2âmm), that only minimally affect pharyngeal and UES contractions. Method: 29 healthy volunteers underwent pharyngeal and upper esophageal HRM. All subjects performed 10 water swallows of 2âml in an upright position. Pressure and time dependent parameters of the velopharyngeal region, the tongue base and the UES have been evaluated. Mean and median values and different percentile ranges were calculated. Results: The normative values for the key parameters were (meanÂ±SD): maximum velopharyngeal pressure 269.9Â±113.1âmmHg, maximum tongue base pressure 278Â±93.6âmmHg, maximum UES pressure 205.8Â±64.0âmmHg, UES resting pressure 42.5Â±18.7âmmHg and relaxation time of the UES 681.6Â±86.8âms. Further parameters have been measured. Conclusion: Time dependent values are comparable to those already published. Especially in the UES lower pressures can be measured when a small HRM-probe is used. The normative data established in this study might help to distinguish pathological from physiological swallows using HRM.


Title #42: [Surgical Simulation Models for Sialendoscopy.]
PMID: 25739071
Authors: U. U. Geisthoff, G F GF. Volk, M. M. Finkensieper, C. C. Wittekindt, O. O. Guntinas-Lichius
Abstract: Objective: Different simulation models are in use to teach the technique of sialendoscopy. Only a few reports in literature deal with this topic with no comparison having been published, yet. We therefore asked sialendoscopy training course participants about our applied models by using a questionnaire. Material und Methods: A tube-, a pepper-, a porcine kidney-, and a pig head-model were developed as training models and used during 6 consecutive practical sialendoscopy courses from 2012 to 2014. Participants were asked to answer a questionnaire specifically designed to assess the value of the different training models. Results: All respondents (n=61) rated all training models positively. However, porcine kidney- and pig head-models were described to be superior, especially with respect to realistic simulation. Intubation of the papilla can be practised sufficiently only in the pig head-model. The tube- and peppers-models have the advantage of being less expensive, easier to handle and cleaner. Conclusions: The models described are all useful in learning the sialendoscopy technique. However, they have distinct advantages and disadvantages making a combination of different models useful.

Abstract: Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation (IABP) is often used in patients with acute coronary syndrome for its favourable effects on left ventricular (LV) systolic function and coronary perfusion. However, the effects of IABP on LV diastolic function have not been comprehensively investigated. Acute diastolic dysfunction has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of IABP on LV diastolic dysfunction using standard TEE derived parameters.


Title #44: Effect of astragalosideÂ IV against rat myocardial cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress via mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
PMID: 25739067
Authors: Feng-Ying FY. Guan, Shi-Jie SJ. Yang, Jinxiang J. Liu, Si-Rui SR. Yang
Abstract: Astragaloside is one of the most common traditional Chinese medicines and is derived from AstragalusÂ membranaceus. AstragalosideÂ IV (AsIV) is a monomer located in an extract of astragaloside. The current study investigated the protective effects of AsIV against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)âinduced injury in cardiocytes and elucidated the mechanisms responsible for this protective effect. Cultured neonatal rat cardiocytes were divided into five experimental groups as follows: i)Â Dimethyl sulfoxide; ii)Â H2O2; iii)Â AsIV+H2O2; iv)Â AsIV+H2O2+5âhydroxydecanoate (5âHD); and v)Â nicorandil+H2O2. Cardiocyte survival was analyzed using an MTT assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was also assessed to evaluate the viability of the cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by 2,7âdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. The apoptotic rate was measured by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) and intracellular calcium were observed using a laser confocal microscopy system. The results indicated that AsIV promoted the survival of cardiocytes (P<0.05), attenuated LDH release (P<0.05), ROS production (P<0.01) and apoptosis (P<0.01), stabilized the ÎÎ¨m and reduced intracellular calcium overload (P<0.01) compared with the H2O2 group. The mitochondrial adenosine triphosphateâsensitive potassium channel (mitoKATP) inhibitor 5âHD was observed to partially reverse the protective effect of AsIV. Following treatment with 5âHD, the survival of cardiocytes was reduced (P<0.05), LDH release (P<0.01) and ROS production (P<0.05) were stimulated, ÎÎ¨m and intracellular calcium change were increased (P<0.01) and apoptosis was increased (P<0.01) compared with the AsIV+H2O2 group. Thus, AsIV has potential for use in the suppression of apoptosis resulting from H2O2 exposure, and mitoKATP activation may underlie this protective mechanism.


Title #45: An Academic-Practice Model to Improve the Health of Underserved Neighborhoods.
PMID: 25739066
Authors: Peggy P. Wros, Launa Rae LR. Mathews, Heather H. Voss, Nicholas N. Bookman
Abstract: The Interprofessional Care Access Network is an innovative model for academic-practice partnership providing care coordination for vulnerable and underserved clients and populations in identified neighborhoods. Interprofessional student teams, including health professions students from nursing, medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, collaborate with community service organizations and primary care clinics to address social determinants of health identified as barriers to achieving health care outcomes and Triple Aim goals. Teams are supervised by a nursing faculty in residence and address issues such as housing, health insurance, food security, and lack of primary care. Two case studies demonstrate the potential impact of the project.


Title #46: Playgroups Offering Health and Well-being Support for Families: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 25739065
Authors: Ali A. Lakhani, Kym K. Macfarlane
Abstract: This systematic review explores the health and well-being outcomes that families experience as a result of their participation in playgroups that provide health and well-being services. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature resulted in 12 articles for inclusion. A meta-synthesis method, using reciprocal translation, was implemented to synthesize findings. Findings suggest that programs support children's social development, transition to school, and overall health. For parents, programs provide targeted social and health support, and knowledge sharing and learning opportunities. Future research in this area will benefit from participatory research approaches and exploring how universal approaches to program provision benefit families.


Title #47: Neighborhood Social Environment and Patterns of Adherence to Oral Hypoglycemic Agents Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
PMID: 25739064
Authors: Heather F HF. de Vries McClintock, Douglas J DJ. Wiebe, Alison J AJ. OÊ¼Donnell, Knashawn H KH. Morales, Dylan S DS. Small, Hillary R HR. Bogner
Abstract: This study examined whether neighborhood social environment was related to patterns of adherence to oral hypoglycemic agents among primary care patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Residents in neighborhoods with high social affluence, high residential stability, and high neighborhood advantage, compared to residents in neighborhoods with one or no high features present, were significantly more likely to have an adherent pattern compared to a nonadherent pattern. Neighborhood social environment may influence patterns of adherence. Reliance on a multilevel contextual framework, extending beyond the individual, to promote diabetic self-management activities may be essential for notable public health improvements.


Title #48: The Experience of Primary Care Providers With an Integrated Mental Health Care Program in Safety-Net Clinics.
PMID: 25739063
Authors: Wayne D WD. Bentham, Anna A. Ratzliff, David D. Harrison, Ya-Fen YF. Chan, Steven S. Vannoy, JÃ¼rgen J. UnÃ¼tzer
Abstract: Primary care providers participating in a statewide implementation of an integrated mental health care program for "safety-net" patients in primary care clinics were surveyed to elicit their experiences and level of satisfaction. Quantitative analyses were performed to identify respondent characteristics and satisfaction with the program. Qualitative analyses were done to identify common themes in response to the question "How could psychiatric consultation [in the program] be improved?" Primary care providers were generally satisfied with the integrated mental health care program and raised several concerns that suggest important principles for successful future implementations of these types of programs.


Title #49: Understanding Low-Income African American Women's Expectations, Preferences, and Priorities in Prenatal Care.
PMID: 25739062
Authors: Brownsyne Tucker BT. Edmonds, Marjie M. Mogul, Judy A JA. Shea
Abstract: We aimed to explore factors affecting prenatal care attendance and preferences for prenatal care experiences among low-income black women by conducting a focus group study using a community-based participatory research framework and nominal group technique. Discussions were audiorecorded, transcribed, and coded by trained reviewers. Friends/family and baby's health were the top attendance motivators. Greatest barriers were insurance, transportation, and ambivalence. Facilitators included transportation services, social support, and resource education. In a "perfect system," women wanted continuity of care, personal connection, and caring/respect from providers. Relationship-centered maternity care models may mitigate disparities. Group prenatal care may provide the continuity and support system desired.


Title #50: Resident Health Advocates in Public Housing Family Developments.
PMID: 25739061
Authors: Deborah J DJ. Bowen, Sarah Gees SG. Bhosrekar, Jo-Anna JA. Rorie, Rachel R. Goodman, Gerry G. Thomas, Nancy Irwin NI. Maxwell, Eugenia E. Smith
Abstract: Translation of research to practice often needs intermediaries to help the process occur. Our Prevention Research Center has identified a total of 89 residents of public housing in the last 11 years who have been working in the Resident Health Advocate (RHA) program to engage residents in improving their own and other residents' health status by becoming trained in skills needed by community health workers. Future directions include training for teens to become Teen RHAs and further integration of our RHA program with changes in the health care system and in the roles of community health workers in general.


Title #51: Experimental traumatic brain injury results in long-term recovery of functional responsiveness in sensory cortex but persisting structural changes and sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional deficits.
PMID: 25739059
Authors: Victoria Philippa Anne VP. Johnstone, David K DK. Wright, Kendrew K C KK. Wong, Terence John TJ. O'Brien, Ramesh R. Rajan, Sandy S. Shultz
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. In recent studies we have shown that experimental TBI caused an immediate (24 hr post) suppression of neuronal processing, especially in supragranular cortical layers. We now examine the long-term effects of experimental TBI on the sensory cortex, and how these changes may contribute to a range of TBI morbidities. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received either a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury (n=14) or a sham surgery (n=12) and 12 weeks recovery before behavioural assessment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrophysiological recordings from the barrel cortex. The TBI rats demonstrated sensorimotor deficits, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behaviour, and this was associated with significant atrophy of the barrel cortex and other brain structures. Extracellular recordings from ipsilateral barrel cortex revealed normal neuronal responsiveness and diffusion tensor MRI showed increased fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and tract density within this region. These findings suggest that the long-term recovery of neuronal responsiveness is due to structural reorganisation within this region. Therefore it is likely that long-term structural and functional changes within sensory cortex post-TBI may allow for recovery of neuronal responsiveness, but that this recovery does not remediate all behavioural deficits.


Title #52: The ribosome-associated complex antagonizes prion formation in yeast.
PMID: 25739058
Authors: Alvaro J AJ. Amor, Dominic T DT. Castanzo, Sean P SP. Delany, Daniel M DM. Selechnik, Alex A. van Ooy, Dale M DM. Cameron
Abstract: The number of known fungal proteins capable of switching between alternative stable conformations is steadily increasing, suggesting that a prion-like mechanism may be broadly utilized as a means to propagate altered cellular states. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which cells regulate prion formation and toxicity we examined the role of the yeast ribosome-associated complex (RAC) in modulating both the formation of the [PSI(+)] prion - an alternative conformer of Sup35 protein - and the toxicity of aggregation-prone polypeptides. The Hsp40 RAC chaperone Zuo1 anchors the RAC to ribosomes and stimulates the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssb. We found that cells lacking Zuo1 are sensitive to over-expression of some aggregation-prone proteins, including the Sup35 prion domain, suggesting that co-translational protein misfolding increases in Îzuo1 strains. Consistent with this finding, Îzuo1 cells exhibit higher frequencies of spontaneous and induced prion formation. Cells expressing mutant forms of Zuo1 lacking either a C-terminal charged region required for ribosome association, or the J-domain responsible for Ssb ATPase stimulation, exhibit similarly high frequencies of prion formation. Our findings are consistent with a role for the RAC in chaperoning nascent Sup35 to regulate folding of the N-terminal prion domain as it emerges from the ribosome.


Title #53: Nasal Mucosa Derived-Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Mice Reduce Inflammation via Modulating Immune Responses.
PMID: 25739057
Authors: Chen C. Yang, Jing J. Li, Hai H. Lin, Keqing K. Zhao, Chunquan C. Zheng
Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have arisen the attention to be a new attractive therapeutic tool treating autoimmune diseases such as allergic rhinitis (AR). AR is a chronic reversible allergic inflammation caused by the excessive activation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cells. Recently, MSCs have been proposed as a new therapy of AR as it can suppress some cytokines to control allogeneic Th2 response and functions. However, how MSCs function to reduce inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ectomesenchymal stem cells (ECTO-MSCs) derived from nasal mucosa in eosinophilic inflammation and how it affects some immunoglobulins and cytokines. We used ovalbumin (OVA) as a sensitizer to induce nasal inflammation in mice by both injection and inhalation. In order to obtain deeper insights into the influences of ECTO-MSCs on nasal inflammation, the migration of ECTO-MSCs was assessed, the numbers of eosinophils and sneezing were counted, and several immunoglobulins and cytokines were measured. Here we show the ECTO-MSCs are able to migrate to inflammation site via tail vein injection. Eosinophils and sneezing were suppressed by ECTO-MSCs. Interestingly, IgE, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10 secreted by Th-2 cells were down-regulated by ECTO-MSCs whereas IgG2 and IFN-Î³ were up-regulated. In conclusion, we have observed that ECTO-MSCs are associated with enhanced Th-1 immune response to nasal inflammation and reduced Th-2 immune response. Given the contributions of Th-2 cells to AR, the injection of ECTO-MSCs can be a promising therapy of AR through balancing immune response.


Title #54: Thymosin beta 4 is associated with RUNX2 expression through the Smad and Akt signaling pathways in mouse dental epithelial cells.
PMID: 25739055

Abstract: In previous studies by our group, we reported that thymosinÂ betaÂ 4 (Tb4) is closely associated with the initiation and development of the tooth germ, and can induce the expression of runt-related transcription factorÂ 2 (RUNX2) during the development of the tooth germ. RUNX2 regulates the expression of odontogenesis-related genes, such as amelogenin, X-linked (Amelx), ameloblastin (Ambn) and enamelin (Enam), as well as the differentiation of osteoblasts during bone formation. However, the mechanisms through which Tb4 induces the expression of RUNX2 remain unknown. In the present study, we employed a mouse dental epithelial cell line, mDE6, with the aim to elucidate these mechanisms. The mDE6 cells expressed odontogenesis-related genes, such as Runx2, Amelx, Ambn and Enam, and formed calcified matrices upon the induction of calcification, thus showing characteristics of odontogenic epithelial cells. The expression of odontogenesis-related genes, and the calcification of the mDE6 cells were reduced by the inhibition of phosphorylated Smad1/5 (p-Smad1/5) and phosphorylated AktÂ (p-Akt) proteins. Furthermore, we used siRNA against Tb4 to determine whether RUNX2 expression and calcification are associated with Tb4 expression in the mDE6 cells. The protein expression of p-Smad1/5 and p-Akt in the mDE6 cells was reduced by treatment with Tb4-siRNA. These results suggest that Tb4 is associated with RUNX2 expression through the Smad and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and with calcification through RUNX2 expression in the mDE6 cells. This study provides putative information concerning the signaling pathway through which Tb4 induces RUNX2 expression, which may help to understand the regulation of tooth development and tooth regeneration.


Title #55: Correlation between three-dimensional rectosonography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis: a preliminary study on the first fifty cases.
PMID: 25739054
Authors: Charles-AndrÃ© CA. Philip, Christian C. Bisch, AgnÃ©s A. Coulon, Pierre P. de Saint-Hilaire, RenÃ©-Charles RC. Rudigoz, Gil G. Dubernard
Abstract: Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) raises a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the reference technique in endometriosis, is questioned for posterior pelvic lesions, especially in rectosigmoid locations. In this study, we describe a new technique called three-dimensional rectosonography (3D-RSG), which combines standard transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS), 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography and the use of water for rectal contrast. We also assess the correlation between 3D-RSG and MRI in the diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis.

Title #58: Epidermal Expression and Regulation of Interleukin-33 During Homeostasis and Inflammation: Strong Species Differences.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-33 is a novel IL-1-family member with a putative role in inflammatory skin disorders and a complex biology. Therefore, recent conflicting data regarding its function in experimental models justifies a close assessment of its tissue expression and regulation. Indeed, we report here that there are strong species-differences in expression and regulation of epidermal IL-33. In murine epidermis IL-33 behaved like an alarmin, being constitutively expressed in keratinocyte nuclei and rapidly lost during acute inflammation. By contrast, human and porcine IL-33 were weakly expressed or absent in keratinocytes of non-inflamed skin but induced during acute inflammation. To this end, we observed that expression of IL-33 in human but not murine keratinocytes was strongly induced by IFN-Î³ and this upregulation completely depended on the presence of EGFR ligands. Accordingly, IFN-Î³ increased expression of IL-33 in the basal layers of the epidermis in human ex vivo skin cultures only, despite good evidence of IFN-Î³-activity in cultures from both species. Together these findings demonstrate that a full understanding of IL-33 function in clinical settings must take species-specific differences into account.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 04 March 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.85.


Title #59: Elastin Modification by 4-Hydroxynonenal in Hairless Mice Exposed to UV-A. Role in Photoaging and Actinic Elastosis.
PMID: 25739050

Abstract: Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations causes oxidative stress, which is involved in photoaging and actinic elastosis. UV and reactive oxygen species generate lipid peroxidation products, including the Î±,Î²-unsaturated carbonyl compounds such as acrolein or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). These aldehydes can modify proteins of the extracellular matrix, but their role in the pathogenesis of photoaging is not clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these aldehydes contribute to alter elastin metabolism and whether topical carbonyl scavengers delay UV-induced skin photoaging. Hairless mice (4-6 weeks old) daily exposed to UV-A (20 Joules/cm(2)/day, up to 600 Joules/cm(2)) exhibited the typical features of photoaging, associated with a significant increase in 4-HNE- and acrolein-adduct content and elastotic material deposition. Immunofluorescence studies showed the accumulation of 4-HNE-adducts on elastin in the dermis of UV-A-exposed mice. This was mimicked in vitro by incubating orcein-elastin with 4-HNE or acrolein, which altered its digestion by leukocyte-elastase, a feature possibly involved in the accumulation of elastotic material. A daily topical application of carnosine completely reversed the development of photoaging alterations, and 4-HNE-adduct formation on elastin. These data emphasize the role of 4-HNE and acrolein in the mechanism of photoaging, and the preventive effect of carbonyl scavengers.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 04 March 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.84.


Title #60: Controlling the Balance of Fibroblast Proliferation and Differentiation-Impact of Thy-1.
PMID: 25739049
Authors: Manuela M. Schmidt, Danny D. Gutknecht, Jan C JC. Simon, Jan-Niklas JN. Schulz, Beate B. Eckes, Ulf U. Anderegg, Anja A. Saalbach
Abstract: Fibroblasts provide matrix and regulatory mediators to the microenvironment and thereby contribute to maintenance of tissue homeostasis, wound healing and tumor progression. In the present study we addressed the functional relevance of Thy-1 for fibroblast functions in vitro and in vivo. Using fibroblasts from Thy-1(-/-) and wildtype mice, recombinant expression of Thy-1 and analysis of the interaction of fibroblasts with immobilized Thy-1 we showed that Thy-1 plays a crucial role in the control of cell growth by suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis and differentiation of dermal fibroblasts. Function-blocking studies revealed that Thy-1 mediates the control of apoptosis and proliferation via modulation of Î²3 integrin function. Interestingly, Thy-1-mediated growth control appears to be a more general mechanism because it also regulates growth of tumor cells of different origin dependent on their Î²3 integrin expression. In summary, our findings point to an important role of Thy-1 in controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation in dermal fibroblasts.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 04 March 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.86.


Title #61: Dimeric Abietane Diterpenoids and Sesquiterpenoid Lactones from Teucrium viscidum.
PMID: 25739048
Authors: Chun C. Gao, Li L. Han, Dan D. Zheng, Hongwei H. Jin, Chunyan C. Gai, Jianbin J. Wang, Hao H. Zhang, Liangren L. Zhang, Hongzheng H. Fu
Abstract: A new abietane diterpenoid, teuvisone (2), a pair of new dimeric abietane diterpenoid stereoisomers, biteuvisones A (3) and B (4), and three new sesquiterpenoid lactones, teuvislactones A-C (6, 7, and 10), were isolated from the whole plants of Teucrium viscidum, along with four known terpenoids (1, 5, 8, and 9). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configurations of 5-10 were determined by electronic circular dichroism analysis. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects against five human cancer cell lines and for their Î±-glucosidase inhibitory effects.

Title #64: Enhanced killing of SCC17B human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells after photodynamic therapy plus fenretinide via the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway and apoptosis.
PMID: 25739041
Authors: Nithin B NB. Boppana, Ursula U. Stochaj, Mohamed M. Kodiha, Alicja A. Bielawska, Jacek J. Bielawski, Jason S JS. Pierce, Mladen M. Korbelik, Duska D. Separovic
Abstract: Because photodynamic therapy (PDT) alone is not always effective as an anticancer treatment, PDT is combined with other anticancer agents for improved efficacy. The clinically-relevant fenretinide [N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide; 4HPR], was combined with the silicon phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc4-mediated PDT to test for their potential to enhance killing of SCC17B cells, a clinically-relevant model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Because each of these treatments induces apoptosis and regulates the deÂ novo sphingolipid (SL) biosynthesis pathway, the role of ceramide synthase, the pathway-associated enzyme, in PDT+4HPR-induced apoptotic cell death was determined using the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 (FB). PDT+4HPR enhanced loss of clonogenicity. zVAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, and FB, protected cells from death post-PDT+4HPR. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 inhibitor ABT199 enhanced cell killing after PDT+4HPR. Combining PDT with 4HPR led to FB-sensitive, enhanced Bax associated with mitochondria and cytochrome c redistribution. Mass spectrometry data showed that the accumulation of C16-dihydroceramide, a precursor of ceramide in the deÂ novo SL biosynthesis pathway, was enhanced after PDT+4HPR. Using quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that PDT+4HPR enhanced dihydroceramide/ceramide accumulation in the ER, which was inhibited by FB. The results suggest that SCC17B cells are sensitized to PDT by 4HPR via the deÂ novo SL biosynthesis pathway and apoptosis, and imply potential clinical relevance of the combination for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is characterised by progressive, predominantly distal, asymmetrical limb weakness and usually multiple partial motor nerve conduction blocks. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is beneficial but the role of immunosuppressive agents is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2011.


Title #66: Conditioned medium from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells induces migration and angiogenesis.
PMID: 25739039

Abstract: Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCâMSCs) have been suggested as a candidate for various clinical applications, however, major limitations include the lack of organâspecific accumulation and low survival rates of transplanted cells. In the present study, it was hypothesized that the paracrine effects of UCâMSCs may enhance stem cellâbased tissue repair and regeneration by promoting the specific homing of stem/progenitor cells and the overall ability to drive them to the damaged area. UCâMSCsâderived conditioned medium (UCâCM) was analyzed using liquid chip and ELISA techniques. InÂ vitro tube formation assays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and UCâMSCs were then performed to assess the angiogenic properties of UCâCM. Subsequently, UCâMSCs, HUVECs and fibroblasts were labeled with PKH26 for an inÂ vivo cell migration assay. The expression levels of CâXâC chemokine receptorÂ 4 (CXCR4), CâC chemokine receptorÂ 2 (CCR2) and câmet were determined in the UCâMSCs, HUVECs and fibroblasts using reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. UCâCM was incubated with or without antibodies, and the contribution of stromal cellâderived factorÂ 1 (SDFâ1), monocyte chemotactic proteinÂ 1 (MCPâ1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on the migration of cells was investigated inÂ vitro. The results demonstrated that UCâMSCs secreted different cytokines and chemokines, including increased quantities of SDFâ1, MCPâ1 and HGF, in addition to the angiogenic factors, vascular cell adhesion proteinâ1, interleukinâ8, insulinâlike growth factorâ1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. The total lengths of the tubes were significantly increased in the UCâMSCs and HUVECs incubated in UCâCM compared with those incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. InÂ vivo cell migration assays demonstrated that UCâCM was a chemotactic stimulus for the UCâMSCs and HUVECs. InÂ vitro Matrigel migration and scratch healing assays demonstrated that UCâCM increased the migration of CXCR4âpostive or/and CCR2âpositive cells in a doseâdependent manner. In addition, different molecules were screened under antibodyâbased blocking migration conditions. The data revealed that the SDFâ1/CXCR4 and MCPâ1/CCR2 axes were involved in the chemoattractive activity of UCâCM and suggested that the effective paracrine factor of UCâCM is a large complex rather than a single factor. The results of the present study supported the hypothesis that UCâMSCs release soluble factors, which may extend the therapeutic applicability of stem cells.


Title #67: The Aerodynamic Cost of Head Morphology in Bats: Maybe Not as Bad as It Seems.
PMID: 25739038

Abstract: At first sight, echolocating bats face a difficult trade-off. As flying animals, they would benefit from a streamlined geometric shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and increase flight efficiency. However, as echolocating animals, their pinnae generate the acoustic cues necessary for navigation and foraging. Moreover, species emitting sound through their nostrils often feature elaborate noseleaves that help in focussing the emitted echolocation pulses. Both pinnae and noseleaves reduce the streamlined character of a bat's morphology. It is generally assumed that by compromising the streamlined charactered of the geometry, the head morphology generates substantial drag, thereby reducing flight efficiency. In contrast, it has also been suggested that the pinnae of bats generate lift forces counteracting the detrimental effect of the increased drag. However, very little data exist on the aerodynamic properties of bat pinnae and noseleaves. In this work, the aerodynamic forces generated by the heads of seven species of bats, including noseleaved bats, are measured by testing detailed 3D models in a wind tunnel. Models of Myotis daubentonii, Macrophyllum macrophyllum, Micronycteris microtis, Eptesicus fuscus, Rhinolophus formosae, Rhinolophus rouxi and Phyllostomus discolor are tested. The results confirm that non-streamlined facial morphologies yield considerable drag forces but also generate substantial lift. The net effect is a slight increase in the lift-to-drag ratio. Therefore, there is no evidence of high aerodynamic costs associated with the morphology of bat heads.


Title #68: Licensing of Primordial Germ Cells for Gametogenesis Depends on Genital Ridge Signaling.
PMID: 25739037

Abstract: In mouse embryos at mid-gestation, primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo licensing to become gametogenesis-competent cells (GCCs), gaining the capacity for meiotic initiation and sexual differentiation. GCCs then initiate either oogenesis or spermatogenesis in response to gonadal cues. Germ cell licensing has been considered to be a cell-autonomous and gonad-independent event, based on observations that some PGCs, having migrated not to the gonad but to the adrenal gland, nonetheless enter meiosis in a time frame parallel to ovarian germ cells -- and do so regardless of the sex of the embryo. Here we test the hypothesis that germ cell licensing is cell-autonomous by examining the fate of PGCs in Gata4 conditional mutant (Gata4 cKO) mouse embryos. Gata4, which is expressed only in somatic cells, is known to be required for genital ridge initiation. PGCs in Gata4 cKO mutants migrated to the area where the genital ridge, the precursor of the gonad, would ordinarily be formed. However, these germ cells did not undergo licensing and instead retained characteristics of PGCs. Our results indicate that licensing is not purely cell-autonomous but is induced by the somatic genital ridge.

Abstract: Different dimensions of commercially available microneedle devices, namely, AdminPatchÂ® microneedle arrays (MN) (0.6, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.5 mm lengths) and DermarollerÂ® microneedle rollers (DR) (0.5 and 1mm lengths) were evaluated for their relative efficiency in enhancement of transdermal permeation of Sumatriptan (SMT). Solubility assessment of SMT was carried out using propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycol (PEG) in combination with saline (S) at different ratios and the order of solubility was found to be 70:30 > 80:20 > 90:10 %v/v in both PG:S and PEG:S. In vitro skin permeation studies were performed using PG:S (70:30 %v/v) as donor vehicle. A significant increase in cumulative amount of SMT permeated, steady state flux, permeability coefficient and diffusion coefficient values were observed after microneedle treatment, and the values were in the order of 1.5mm MN >1.2mm MN >0.9mm MN >1mm DR >0.6mm MN >0.5mm DR > passive permeation. Lag times were significantly shorter after longer microneedle application (0.24h for 1.5mm MN). Arrays were found to be superior to rollers with similar microneedle lengths in enhancing SMT permeation and may be attributed to higher density of microneedles and force of application onto skin. The in vitro flux values revealed that 2.5cm2 area patch is sufficient for effective therapy after treatment of skin with 1.5mm MN. It may be inferred that microneedle application significantly enhances the transdermal penetration of SMT and that it may be feasible to deliver clinically relevant therapeutic levels of SMT using microneedle assisted transdermal delivery systems.

PMID: 25739034
Authors: Cynthia S CS. Hofman, Peter P. Makai, Jeanet W JW. Blom, Han H. Boter, Bianca M BM. Buurman, Marcel G M MG. Olde Rikkert, Rogier R. Donders, RenÃ© J F RJ. Melis
Abstract: The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey-Minimum Dataset (TOPICS-MDS) collects uniform information from research projects funded under the Dutch National Care for the Elderly Programme. To compare the effectiveness of these projects a preference-weighted outcome measure that combined multidimensional TOPICS-MDS outcomes into a composite endpoint (TOPICS-CEP) was developed based on the health state preferences of older persons and informal caregivers.


Title #72: Publication outputs from a Primary and Community Health Research Unit, 2011?14.
PMID: 25739033
Authors: Cynthia S CS. Hofman, Peter P. Makai, Jeanet W JW. Blom, Han H. Boter, Bianca M BM. Buurman, Marcel G M MG. Olde Rikkert, Rogier R. Donders, RenÃ© J F RJ. Melis
Abstract: Publication of research is a goal of research capacity building initiatives. We reviewed the publications generated by practitioner researchers involved with the Primary and Community Health Research Unit (PCHRU), within the Division of Community Health in South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD), between 2011 and 2014. Publications were categorised using the Higher Education Research Data Collection Specifications. Published outputs included five refereed articles, one refereed full conference paper and 25 non-published conference presentations. A further 11 refereed articles in draft form were located. The majority of publications were considered 'not published' and not widely discoverable. Evidence for expected timeframes for project completion, including support for publication of research, is needed.


Title #73: Des-Î³-Carboxyprothrombin (DCP) and NX-DCP Expressions and Their Relationship with Clinicopathological Features in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PMID: 25739032
Authors: Akiko A. Sumi, Jun J. Akiba, Sachiko S. Ogasawara, Masamichi M. Nakayama, Yoriko Y. Nomura, Makiko M. Yasumoto, Sakiko S. Sanada, Osamu O. Nakashima, Toshi T. Abe, Hirohisa H. Yano
Abstract: Des-Î³-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) has been used as a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently the DCP/NX-DCP ratio, calculated by dividing DCP by NX-DCP, has been reported useful in detecting HCC. The purpose of this study is to clarify the significance of DCP and NX-DCP expression in HCC tissues.


Title #74: Comparison of the effects of chlormadinone acetate versus drospirenone containing oral contraceptives on metabolic and hormonal parameters in women with PCOS for a period of two-year follow-up.
PMID: 25739031

Abstract: Abstract Objective: A randomized trial to compare the effects of two oral contraceptive pills containing either chlormadinone acetate or drospirenone as the progestogen, in women with PCOS for a period of two-year follow-up. Methods: Group A received ethinyl-estradiol 0.03âmgâ+âdrospirenone 3âmg (EEâ+âDRSP; nâ=â56) and Group B received ethinyl-estradiol 0.03âmgâ+âchlormadinone acetate 2âmg (EEâ+âCMA; nâ=â50). Clinical, hormonal and biochemical parameters were compared at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Results: The increase in total cholesterol and hsCRP levels was statistically significantly higher at 6, 12 and 24 months in Group B when compared with Group A. The change in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at the 24 months of treatment was statistically significantly higher in Group A. Group A has a significantly higher reduction in FAI at 6 and 24 months, in FGS at 6, 12 and 24 months and in HOMA-IR index at 12 and 24 months when compared with Group B. Conclusions: Drospirenone containing combined oral contraceptive (COC) is found to have more favorable effects on lipid profiles, hsCRP levels, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism when compared with the CMA containing COC and appears to be more beneficial for the long-term cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of PCOS.


Title #75: Quantitative Computed Tomographic Descriptors Associate Tumor Shape Complexity and Intratumor Heterogeneity with Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma.
PMID: 25739030
Authors: Olya O. Grove, Anders E AE. Berglund, Matthew B MB. Schabath, Hugo J W L HJ. Aerts, Andre A. Dekker, Hua H. Wang, Emmanuel Rios ER. Velazquez, Philippe P. Lambin, Yuhua Y. Gu, Yoganand Y. Balagurunathan, Edward E. Eikman, Robert A RA. Gatenby, Steven S. Eschrich, Robert J RJ. Gillies
Abstract: Two CT features were developed to quantitatively describe lung adenocarcinomas by scoring tumor shape complexity (feature 1: convexity) and intratumor density variation (feature 2: entropy ratio) in routinely obtained diagnostic CT scans. The developed quantitative features were analyzed in two independent cohorts (cohort 1: n = 61; cohort 2: n = 47) of patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma, retrospectively curated to include imaging and clinical data. Preoperative chest CTs were segmented semi-automatically. Segmented tumor regions were further subdivided into core and boundary sub-regions, to quantify intensity variations across the tumor. Reproducibility of the features was evaluated in an independent test-retest dataset of 32 patients. The proposed metrics showed high degree of reproducibility in a repeated experiment (concordance, CCCâ¥0.897; dynamic range, DRâ¥0.92). Association with overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and the log-rank test. Both features were associated with overall survival (convexity: p = 0.008; entropy ratio: p = 0.04) in Cohort 1 but not in Cohort 2 (convexity: p = 0.7; entropy ratio: p = 0.8). In both cohorts, these features were found to be descriptive and demonstrated the link between imaging characteristics and patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma.


Title #76: Successful Pregnancy and Delivery After Radiation With Ovarian Shielding for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Before Menarche.
PMID: 25739028
Authors: Naoya N. Ishibashi, Toshiya T. Maebayashi, Takuya T. Aizawa, Masakuni M. Sakaguchi, Osamu O. Abe, Tsutomu T. Saito, Yoshiaki Y. Tanaka, Motoaki M. Chin, Hideo H. Mugishima
Abstract: Total body irradiation is performed as a preconditioning regimen to inhibit graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation and to eradicate remaining tumor cells. However, these regimens result in delayed secondary sex characteristics and failure of ovarian function recovery, leading to amenorrhea and infertility. Herein, we report a case of an 11-year-old girl diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia who received induction chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. For bone marrow transplantation, she received total body irradiation of 12 Gy with uterine and ovarian shielding at 13 years of age. The patient remained in remission and menarche began at 14 years of age. At 23, she became pregnant and delivered a baby naturally with no abnormalities.


Title #77: Isolated Midbrain Ischemic Infarct in Association With Hyperlipoproteinemia (a): A Report of 2 Adolescent Patients.
PMID: 25739027
Authors: Srivandana S. Akshintala, Robert A RA. Avery, Jonathan J. Murnick, Nicole N. Verdun, Yaser Y. Diab
Abstract: Arterial ischemic strokes (AIS) localized solely to the midbrain are extremely uncommon in the pediatric population. Elevated lipoprotein (a), which promotes atherosclerosis and a prothrombotic state, has been associated with increased risk of AIS in children and adults. Here we describe a 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl who presented with internuclear ophthalmoplegia secondary to an isolated midbrain AIS. Evaluation for risk factors for AIS in these otherwise healthy adolescents identified hyperlipoproteinemia (a) in combination with other potential prothrombotic conditions suggesting that hypercoagulable states such as hyperlipoproteinemia (a) may have contributed to development of small-vessel arteriopathy and localized AIS.


Title #78: Coronary Endothelial Dysfunction Induced by Nlrp3 Inflammasome Activation during Hypercholesterolemia: Beyond Inflammation.
PMID: 25739025
Authors: Yang Y. Zhang, Xiang Yzhang3 Vcu Edu XY. Li, Ashley L AL. Pitzer, Yang Yzhang3 Vcu Edu YY. Chen, Lei L. Wang, Pin-Lan PL. Li
Abstract: Aims: The present study hypothesized that activation of endothelial Nlrp3 inflammasomes directly produces endothelial dysfunction during hypercholesterolemia, which is distinct from its canonical roles in inflammation. Results: Acute hypercholesterolemia in mice was induced by intraperitoneal administration of poloxamer 407 (0.5 g/kg) for 24 hours. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed by evaluating endothelium-dependent vasodilation in isolated, perfused and pressurized coronary arteries in response to bradykinin (10-10-10-6 M) and acetylcholine (10-9-10-5 M). Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation was observed in Nlrp3+/+ mice with acute hypercholesterolemia, which was markedly ameliorated in Nlrp3-/- mice. Treatment of mice with inhibitors for caspase-1 or high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) significantly restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation in Nlrp3+/+ mice with acute hypercholesterolemia. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia markedly increased caspase-1 activity and HMGB1 expression in coronary arterial endothelium of Nlrp3+/+ mice, which was absent in Nlrp3-deficient mice. Further, recombinant HMGB1 directly induced endothelial dysfunction in normal Nlrp3+/+ coronary arteries. In vitro, Nlrp3 inflammasome formation and its activity were instigated in cultured endothelial cells by cholesterol crystal, a danger factor associated with hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, cholesterol crystals directly induced endothelial dysfunction in coronary arteries from Nlrp3+/+ mice, which was attenuated in Nlrp3-/- arteries. Such cholesterol crystal-induced impairment was associated with enhanced superoxide production, down-regulation of eNOS activity and pyroptosis. Innovation and Conclusion: Our data provide the first evidence that activation of endothelial Nlrp3 inflammasome directly impairs endothelial function beyond its canonical inflammatory actions. This novel non-canonical action of Nlrp3 inflammasomes may initiate or exacerbate vascular injury during hypercholesterolemia.


Title #79: Alterations of BDNF and trkB mRNA Expression in the 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Model of Preclinical Stages of Parkinson's Disease: An Influence of Chronic Pramipexole in Rats.
PMID: 25739024

Abstract: Our recent study has indicated that a moderate lesion of the mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways in rats, modelling preclinical stages of Parkinson's disease, induces a depressive-like behaviour which is reversed by chronic treatment with pramipexole. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling in the aforementioned model of depression. Therefore, we investigated the influence of 6-hydoxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration into the ventral region of the caudate-putamen on mRNA levels of BDNF and tropomyosin-related kinase B (trkB) receptor. The BDNF and trkB mRNA levels were determined in the nigrostriatal and limbic structures by in situ hybridization 2 weeks after the operation. Pramipexole (1 mg/kg sc twice a day) and imipramine (10 mg/kg ip once a day) were injected for 2 weeks. The lesion lowered the BDNF and trkB mRNA levels in the hippocampus [CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)] and amygdala (basolateral/lateral) as well as the BDNF mRNA content in the habenula (medial/lateral). The lesion did not influence BDNF and trkB expression in the caudate-putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens (shell and core) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Chronic imipramine reversed the lesion-induced decreases in BDNF mRNA in the DG. Chronic pramipexole increased BDNF mRNA, but decreased trkB mRNA in the VTA in lesioned rats. Furthermore, it reduced BDNF and trkB mRNA expression in the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens, BDNF mRNA in the amygdala and trkB mRNA in the caudate-putamen in these animals. The present study indicates that both the 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic lesion and chronic pramipexole influence BDNF signalling in limbic structures, which may be related to their pro-depressive and antidepressant activity in rats, respectively.


Title #80: Discovery of Putative Small Non-Coding RNAs from the Obligate Intracellular Bacterium Wolbachia pipientis.
PMID: 25739023
Authors: Megan M. Woolfit, Manjula M. Algama, Jonathan M JM. Keith, Elizabeth A EA. McGraw, Jean J. Popovici
Abstract: Wolbachia pipientis is an endosymbiotic bacterium that induces a wide range of effects in its insect hosts, including manipulation of reproduction and protection against pathogens. Little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying the insect-Wolbachia interaction, though it is likely to be mediated via the secretion of proteins or other factors. There is an increasing amount of evidence that bacteria regulate many cellular processes, including secretion of virulence factors, using small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), but sRNAs have not previously been described from Wolbachia. We have used two independent approaches, one based on comparative genomics and the other using RNA-Seq data generated for gene expression studies, to identify candidate sRNAs in Wolbachia. We experimentally characterized the expression of one of these candidates in four Wolbachia strains, and showed that it is differentially regulated in different host tissues and sexes. Given the roles played by sRNAs in other host-associated bacteria, the conservation of the candidate sRNAs between different Wolbachia strains, and the sex- and tissue-specific differential regulation we have identified, we hypothesise that sRNAs may play a significant role in the biology of Wolbachia, and in particular in its interactions with its host.


Title #81: Co-Prescription Trends in a Large Cohort of Subjects Predict Substantial Drug-Drug Interactions.
PMID: 25739022
Authors: Jeffrey J JJ. Sutherland, Thomas M TM. Daly, Xiong X. Liu, Keith K. Goldstein, Joseph A JA. Johnston, Timothy P TP. Ryan
Abstract: Pharmaceutical prescribing and drug-drug interaction data underlie recommendations on drug combinations that should be avoided or closely monitored by prescribers. Because the number of patients taking multiple medications is increasing, a comprehensive view of prescribing patterns in patients is important to better assess real world pharmaceutical response and evaluate the potential for multi-drug interactions. We obtained self-reported prescription data from NHANES surveys between 1999 and 2010, and confirm the previously reported finding of increasing drug use in the elderly. We studied co-prescription drug trends by focusing on the 2009-2010 survey, which contains prescription data on 690 drugs used by 10,537 subjects. We found that medication profiles were unique for individuals aged 65 years or more, with â¥98 unique drug regimens encountered per 100 subjects taking 3 or more medications. When drugs were viewed by therapeutic class, it was found that the most commonly prescribed drugs were not the most commonly co-prescribed drugs for any of the 16 drug classes investigated. We cross-referenced these medication lists with drug interaction data from Drugs.com to evaluate the potential for drug interactions. The number of drug alerts rose proportionally with the number of co-prescribed medications, rising from 3.3 alerts for individuals prescribed 5 medications to 11.7 alerts for individuals prescribed 10 medications. We found 22% of elderly subjects taking both a substrate and inhibitor of a given cytochrome P450 enzyme, and 4% taking multiple inhibitors of the same enzyme simultaneously. By examining drug pairs prescribed in 0.1% of the population or more, we found low agreement between co-prescription rate and co-discussion in the literature. These data show that prescribing trends in treatment could drive a large extent of individual variability in drug response, and that current pairwise approaches to assessing drug-drug interactions may be inadequate for predicting real world outcomes.


Title #82: Activation of the unfolded protein response in aged human lenses.
PMID: 25739021
Authors: He-Zhen HZ. Tang, Li-Min LM. Yang
Abstract: Cataract formation is a multifactorial disease, induced by a variety of stressors. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressâinduced unfolded protein response (UPR) is known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis. The present study aimed to investigate whether activation of the UPR occurs in human lenses, using human lens epithelial cell (HLEC) lines and lenses obtained from an eye bank, from individuals aged between 50 and 90Â years. In vitro analysis was performed using calcimycin (10Â ÂµM) as an ER stressor. The level of ER stress was measured by the production of ROS, staining for cell death, detection of binding immunoglobulin proteins (BIP) and levels of other UPR proteins, including inositolârequiring enzymeâ1 (IRE), activating transcription factor (ATF)Â 6 and PKRâlike eukaryotic initiation factorÂ 2a kinase (PERK). These parameters were examined in HLECs exposed to calcimycin forÂ 12,Â 24,Â 48Â andÂ 72Â h. Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of the levels of ROS and apoptosis revealed an increase followingÂ 24Â h calcimycin exposure. The reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated a gradual increase in the mRNA levels of BIP, IRE1, ATF6Â and PERK between 12 andÂ 72Â h. A similar effect was observed in the protein levels, which also demonstrated a gradual increase in the levels of endoplasmic oxidoreductinâ1âlike (Ero1âL)âÎ² and protein disulfide isomerase, but a lower level of Ero1âLÎ±. Activation of the UPR involved the apoptotic pathway, revealed by increased levels of C/EBP homologous protein, ATF4Â and caspaseâ4.Â Additionally, the antioxidant protein levels were also suppressed. The investigation of aged human lenses revealed a similar increase in the protein expression of UPR. These results indicated that activation of the UPRâinduced ROS production suppressed the antioxidant status and triggered the apoptotic pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of ageârelated cataracts.


Title #83: Diastolic Dysfunction Is an Independent Predictor of Cardiovascular Events in Incident Dialysis Patients with Preserved Systolic Function.
PMID: 25739020
Authors: Jae Hyun JH. Han, Ji Suk JS. Han, Eun Jin EJ. Kim, Fa Mee FM. Doh, Hyang Mo HM. Koo, Chan Ho CH. Kim, Mi Jung MJ. Lee, Hyung Jung HJ. Oh, Jung Tak JT. Park, Seung Hyeok SH. Han, Dong-Ryeol DR. Ryu, Tae-Hyun TH. Yoo, Shin-Wook SW. Kang
Abstract: Diastolic heart failure (HF), the prevalence of which is gradually increasing, is associated with cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the general population and, more specifically, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the impact of diastolic dysfunction on CV outcomes has not been studied in incident dialysis patients with preserved systolic function.


Title #84: Exome Sequencing Identifies a Novel Gene, WNK1, for Susceptibility to Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP).
PMID: 25739019
Authors: Shuquan S. Rao, Jinghe J. Lang, Lan L. Zhu, Juan J. Chen
Abstract: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common gynecological disorder; however, the genetic components remain largely unidentified. Exome sequencing has been widely used to identify pathogenic gene mutations of several diseases because of its high chromosomal coverage and accuracy. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES), for the first time, on 8 peripheral blood DNA samples from representative POP cases. After filtering the sequencing data from the dbSNP database (build 138) and the 1000 Genomes Project, 2 missense variants in WNK1, c.2668G > A (p.G890R) and c.6761C> T (p.P2254L), were identified and further validated via Sanger sequencing. In validation stage, the c.2668G > A (p.G890R) variant and 8 additional variants were detected in 11 out of 161 POP patients. All these variants were absent in 231 healthy controls. Functional experiments showed that fibroblasts from the utero-sacral ligaments of POP with WNK1 mutations exhibited loose and irregular alignment compared with fibroblasts from healthy controls. In sum, our study identified a novel gene, WNK1, for POP susceptibility, expanded the causal mutation spectrums of POP, and provided evidence for the genetic diagnosis and medical management of POP in the future.

Abstract: The contraceptive needs of illicit opioid users differ from non-drug users but are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to describe contraceptive use and pregnancy outcomes in opioid-using women, and to examine their association with a range of risk factors.


Title #86: Why Latrines Are Not Used: Communities' Perceptions and Practices Regarding Latrines in a Taenia solium Endemic Rural Area in Eastern Zambia.
PMID: 25739017

Abstract: Taenia solium cysticercosis is a neglected parasitic zoonosis occurring in many developing countries. Socio-cultural determinants related to its control remain unclear. Studies in Africa have shown that the underuse of sanitary facilities and the widespread occurrence of free-roaming pigs are the major risk factors for porcine cysticercosis. The study objective was to assess the communities' perceptions, practices and knowledge regarding latrines in a T. solium endemic rural area in Eastern Zambia inhabited by the Nsenga ethno-linguistic group, and to identify possible barriers to their construction and use. A total of 21 focus group discussions on latrine use were organized separately with men, women and children, in seven villages of the Petauke district. The themes covered were related to perceived latrine availability (absence-presence, building obstacles) and perceived latrine use (defecation practices, latrine management, socio-cultural constraints).The findings reveal that latrines were not constructed in every household because of the convenient use of existing latrines in the neighborhood. Latrines were perceived to contribute to good hygiene mainly because they prevent pigs from eating human feces. Men expressed reluctance to abandon the open-air defecation practice mainly because of toilet-associated taboos with in-laws and grown-up children of the opposite gender. When reviewing conceptual frameworks of people's approach to sanitation, we found that seeking privacy and taboos hindering latrine use and construction were mainly explained in our study area by the fact that the Nsenga observe a traditionally matrilineal descent. These findings indicate that in this local context latrine promotion messages should not only focus on health benefits in general. Since only men were responsible for building latrines and mostly men preferred open defecation, sanitation programs should also be directed to men and address related sanitary taboos in order to be effective.


Title #87: Site-specific, intramolecular cross-linking of Pin1 active site residues by the lipid electrophile 4-oxo-2-nonenal.
PMID: 25739016
Authors: Christopher D CD. Aluise, Jeannie M JM. Camarillo, Yuki Y. Shimozu, James J JJ. Galligan, Kristie L KL. Rose, Keri A KA. Tallman, Lawrence J LJ. Marnett
Abstract: Products of oxidative damage to lipids include 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), both of which are cytotoxic electrophiles. ONE reacts more rapidly with nucleophilic amino acid side chains, resulting in covalent protein adducts, including residue-residue cross-links. Previously, we demonstrated that peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase A1 (Pin1) was highly susceptible to adduction by HNE and that the catalytic cysteine (Cys113) was the preferential site of modification. Here, we show that ONE also preferentially adducts Pin1 at the catalytic Cys, but results in a profoundly different modification. Results from experiments using purified Pin1 incubated with ONE revealed the principal product to be a Cys-Lys pyrrole-containing cross-link between the side chains of Cys113 and Lys117. In vitro competition assays between HNE and ONE demonstrate that ONE reacts more rapidly than HNE with Cys113. Exposure of RKO cells to alkynyl-ONE (aONE) followed by copper-mediated click chemistry and streptavidin purification revealed that Pin1 is also modified by ONE in cells. Analysis of the Pin1 crystal structure reveals that Cys113 and Lys117 are oriented toward each other in the active site, facilitating formation of an ONE cross-link.


Title #88: Live tweeting in medicine: 'Tweeting the meeting'
PMID: 25739015
Authors: Alexander M AM. Djuricich, Janine E JE. Zee-Cheng
Abstract: Medical conferences create an opportunity for lifelong learning for healthcare practitioners. The use of Twitter at such conferences continues to expand. This article focuses on how Twitter can be used by physicians and other healthcare providers at regional, national and international conferences, and also at local conferences, such as grand rounds. It also addresses the potential utility of Twitter chats and journal clubs in the promotion of lifelong learning. The impact of Twitter use in healthcare in general, and specifically at conferences, and how it can be measured, is discussed.


Title #89: A pleiotropic effect of the single clustered hepatic metastamiRs miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p on insulin-like growth factorÂ II, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) have a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As the insulinâlike growth factor (IGF) axis is a highly tumorigenic pathway in HCC, the present study attempted to target it with miRs. Potential targeting of crucial members of the IGF axis by miRNAs at the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) was predicted using bioinformatic tools, such as microrna.org, Diana lab and Targetscan, while 5'-UTR targeting was predicted using bibiserv software. Expression profiling of obtained miRNAs was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 22Â nonâmetastatic HCCÂ biopsy samples and 10Â healthy tissues. To investigate the impact of miRNAs on their potential downstream targets, transfection of miRNAs was performed in HuHâ7 cells and the targets' expression was quantified using qPCR. Transcripts of insulinâlike growth factorâ1 receptor (IGFâ1R), insulinâlike growth factor binding proteinâ3 (IGFBPâ3) and IGFâII were found to be potentially targeted at the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR regions by the single clustered hepatic metastamiRs miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p. The two miRNAs showed a similar expression pattern in HCC tissues compared to those in healthy tissues. Forced expression of miRâ96â5p and miRâ182â5p in the HCCÂ cell line HuHâ7 had inducing effects on IGFBPâ3 and IGFâII transcripts. Of note, the two miRs had differential effects on IGFâ1R, where miRâ96â5p induced IGFâ1R mRNA expression and miRâ182â5p inhibited its expression. The present study revealed the pleiotropic impact of the single clustered hepatic metastamiRs miRâ96â5p and miRâ182â5p on IGFâ1R, and an inducing effect on IGFâII and IGFBPâ3 in hepatocellular carcinoma.


Title #90: Timing of Death in Children Referred for Intensive Care With Severe Sepsis: Implications for Interventional Studies.
PMID: 25739013
Authors: Mirjana M. Cvetkovic, Daniel D. Lutman, Padmanabhan P. Ramnarayan, Nazima N. Pathan, David P DP. Inwald, Mark J MJ. Peters
Abstract: Early deaths in pediatric sepsis may limit the impact of therapies that can only be provided on PICUs. By introducing selection and survivorship biases, these very early deaths may also undermine the results of trials that employ standard consent procedures. We hypothesized that: 1) the majority of deaths in children with severe sepsis occur very early, within 24 hours of referral to PICU; and 2) a significant proportion of deaths occur before PICU admission.


Title #91: DHFR-mediated effects of methotrexate in medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma cells: The same outcome of treatment with different doses in sensitive cell lines.

Abstract: Although methotrexate (MTX) is the most wellâknown antifolate included in many standard therapeutic regimens, substantial toxicity limits its wider use, particularly in pediatric oncology. Our study focused on a detailed analysis of MTX effects in cell lines derived from two types of pediatric solid tumors: medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma. The main aim of this study was to analyze the effects of treatment with MTX at concentrations comparable to MTX plasma levels in patients treated with high-dose or low-dose MTX. The results showed that treatment with MTX significantly decreased proliferation activity, inhibited the cell cycle at S-phase and induced apoptosis in Daoy and Saos-2 reference cell lines, which were found to be MTX-sensitive. Furthermore, no difference in these effects was observed following treatment with various doses of MTX ranging from 1Â toÂ 40Â ÂµM. These findings suggest the possibility of achieving the same outcome with the application of low-dose MTX, an extremely important result, particularly for clinical practice. Another important aspect of treatment with high-dose MTX in clinical practice is the administration of leucovorin (LV) as an antidote to reduce MTX toxicity in normal cells. For this reason, the combined application of MTX and LV was also included in our experiments; however, this application of MTX together with LV did not elicit any detectable effect. The expression analysis of genes involved in the mechanisms of resistance to MTX was a final component of our study, and the results helped us to elucidate the mechanisms of the various responses to MTX among the cell lines included in our study.


Title #92: Total Synthesis of (+)-Isatisine A: Application of a Silicon-directed Mukaiyama-type [3+2]-Annulation.
PMID: 25739011
Authors: Jihoon J. Lee, James S JS. Panek
Abstract: Complete details of an asymmetric synthesis of (+)-isatisine A (1) are described. The synthesis highlights the use of a highly diastereoselective Mukaiyama-type [3+2]-annulation of allylsilane 5 with the unsaturated aldehyde 9a to assemble the functionalized tetrahydrofuran core of isatisine A. A convergent route to the framework of the natural product was established employing a substrate-controlled indole coupling, which was followed by a late stage intramolecular copper(I)-mediated amidation to complete the assembly of the tetracyclic framework of (+)-isatisine A. In addition, the scope of the [3+2]-annulation was evaluated and enhanced utilizing diastereomeric allylsilanes anti-5 and syn-5 to establish an efficient route to stereochemically well-defined tetrahydrofurans.


Title #93: Optimized effective potential method and application to static RPA correlation.
PMID: 25739010
Authors: Taro T. Fukazawa, Hisazumi H. Akai
Abstract: The optimized effective potential (OEP) method is a promising technique for calculating the ground state properties of a system within the density functional theory. However, it is not widely used as its computational cost is rather high and, also, some ambiguity remains in the theoretical framework. In order to overcome these problems, we first introduced a method that accelerates the OEP scheme in a static RPA-level correlation functional. Second, the Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation is exploited to solve the OEP equation. Although seemingly too crude, this approximation did not reduce the accuracy of the description of the magnetic transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) examined here, the magnetic properties of which are rather sensitive to correlation effects. Finally, we reformulated the OEP method to render it applicable to the direct RPA correlation functional and other, more precise, functionals. Emphasis is placed on the following three points of the discussion: (i) level-crossing at the Fermi surface is taken into account; (ii) eigenvalue variations in a Kohn-Sham functional are correctly treated; and (iii) the resultant OEP equation is different from those reported to date.


Title #94: In situ synthesis and high adsorption performance of MoO2/Mo4O11 and MoO2/MoS2 composite nanorods by reduction of MoO3.
PMID: 25739009
Authors: Bingyu B. Xu, Ying Y. Li, Guofeng G. Wang, Dongdong D. Zhao, Kai K. Pan, Baojiang B. Jiang, Wei W. Zhou, Honggang H. Fu
Abstract: MoO2/Mo4O11 and MoO2/MoS2 composite nanorods were successfully synthesized by reducing MoO3 nanorods. The adsorption performance of samples was evaluated by using Rhodamine B (RhB) and metal ions in aqueous solutions as the targets. The results indicated that the obtained MoO2/Mo4O11 and MoO2/MoS2 composite nanorods can present excellent adsorption performance. The BET surface areas of samples increased with increasing the MoO3â:âS mass ratio. The adsorption kinetics for the RhB and Cu(2+) ions on the composite nanorods were well fitted to a pseudo-second order model.


Title #95: Method Comparison for Enhanced Recovery, Isolation and Qualitative Detection of C. jejuni and C. coli from Wastewater Effluent Samples.

Abstract: Seeking a sensitive protocol, culture-dependent methods were compared to detect thermophilic Campylobacter species in untreated urban effluents. We evaluated various combinations of selective media, with and without an enrichment steps, as well as an extra filtration step. Culture-independent real-time quantitative PCR was also included and all detected isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All tested water samples contained Campylobacter DNA, but only 64% were positive after culture. Although enrichment using Preston broth resulted in better recovery of potentially stressed Campylobacter than Bolton or Campyfood broth (CFB), there was no significant increase in efficiency compared to direct plating. The type of selective agar media used, on the other hand, had a significant effect, with CASA plates performing better than mCCDA or CFA ones. Inclusion of an enrichment step increased the ratio of C. coli vs. C. jejuni being isolated. Resistances against all antimicrobials tested were observed in C. coli, but fewer instances of resistance were found in C. jejuni isolates. Whether this difference was the result of selection during the enrichment step could not be determined. The presence of Campylobacter in urban effluents can be considered as a valuable proxy for Campylobacter populations present in urban environments.


Title #96: Temperature Variation and Heat Wave and Cold Spell Impacts on Years of Life Lost Among the Urban Poor Population of Nairobi, Kenya.
PMID: 25739007
Authors: Thaddaeus T. Egondi, Catherine C. Kyobutungi, Joacim J. RocklÃ¶v
Abstract: Weather extremes are associated with adverse health outcomes, including mortality. Studies have investigated the mortality risk of temperature in terms of excess mortality, however, this risk estimate may not be appealing to policy makers assessing the benefits expected for any interventions to be adopted. To provide further evidence of the burden of extreme temperatures, we analyzed the effect of temperature on years of life lost (YLL) due to all-cause mortality among the population in two urban informal settlements. YLL was generated based on the life expectancy of the population during the study period by applying a survival analysis approach. Association between daily maximum temperature and YLL was assessed using a distributed lag nonlinear model. In addition, cold spell and heat wave effects, as defined according to different percentiles, were investigated. The exposure-response curve between temperature and YLL was J-shaped, with the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) of 26 Â°C. An average temperature of 21 Â°C compared to the MMT was associated with an increase of 27.4 YLL per day (95% CI, 2.7-52.0 years). However, there was no additional effect for extended periods of cold spells, nor did we find significant associations between YLL to heat or heat waves. Overall, increased YLL from all-causes were associated with cold spells indicating the need for initiating measure for reducing health burdens.


Title #97: Understanding Socio-cultural Influences on Smoking among Older Greek-Australian Smokers Aged 50 and over: Facilitators or Barriers? A Qualitative Study.

Abstract: Smokers of all ages can benefit by quitting, but many smokers continue to smoke. Older Greek-Australian smokers, one of the largest ethnic groups in Australia, have higher rates of smoking than other groups of older Australians. This qualitative study aimed to explore older Greek-Australians' views about socio-cultural influences on their smoking. A snowball sampling technique was used to identify twenty Greek-Australian smokers (12 males and eight females), aged â¥ 50 years. They were recruited through the Greek Orthodox Community Center of South Australia (GOCSA). Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The audio-taped interviews were translated and transcribed, and then analysed using content analysis. Results suggested that smoking was considered as the "norm" by older Greek-Australian smokers. There were four groups embedded in the participants' social networks that were reported to be important in relation to either encouraging smoking or, smoking abstinence. These support groups included: family members, friends, the Greek community, and physicians. Smokers' family members (brothers) and friends were identified as facilitators of smoking whereas non-smoker family members (children and spouses) were reported as providing barriers to smoking. Different approaches were used by supporter groups to assist smokers to quit smoking-both planned and unplanned. Knowledge, planning of social and cultural supports, and addressing barriers to smoking cessation are a important part of health planning for older Greek-Australians. Social norms, including those arising from social interactions, and predisposing traits can influence smoking behaviour. Addressing the specific barriers to smoking cessation of older Greek-Australians is critical to addressing the risk for chronic disease in this group.


Title #98: Validation Analysis of a Geriatric Dehydration Screening Tool in Community-Dwelling and Institutionalized Elderly People.

Abstract: Dehydration is common among elderly people. The aim of this study was to perform validation analysis of a geriatric dehydration-screening tool (DST) in the assessment of hydration status in elderly people. This tool was based on the DST proposed by Vivanti et al., which is composed by 11 items (four physical signs of dehydration and seven questions about thirst sensation, pain and mobility), with four questions extra about drinking habits. The resulting questionnaire was evaluated in a convenience sample comprising institutionalized (n = 29) and community-dwelling (n = 74) elderly people. Urinary parameters were assessed (24-h urine osmolality and volume) and free water reserve (FWR) was calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate the scale's dimensionality and Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the reliability of each subscale. Construct's validity was tested using linear regression to estimate the association between scores in each dimension and urinary parameters. Two factors emerged from factor analysis, which were named "Hydration Score" and "Pain Score", and both subscales showed acceptable reliabilities. The "Hydration Score" was negatively associated with 24-h urine osmolality in community-dwelling; and the "Pain Score" was negatively associated with 24-h urine osmolality, and positively associated with 24-h urine volume and FWR in institutionalized elderly people.


Title #99: Effect of Forest Walking on Autonomic Nervous System Activity in Middle-Aged Hypertensive Individuals: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 25739004

Abstract: There has been increasing attention on the therapeutic effects of the forest environment. However, evidence-based research that clarifies the physiological effects of the forest environment on hypertensive individuals is lacking. This study provides scientific evidence suggesting that a brief forest walk affects autonomic nervous system activity in middle-aged hypertensive individuals. Twenty participants (58.0 Â± 10.6 years) were instructed to walk predetermined courses in forest and urban environments (as control). Course length (17-min walk), walking speed, and energy expenditure were equal between the forest and urban environments to clarify the effects of each environment. Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate were used to quantify physiological responses. The modified semantic differential method and Profile of Mood States were used to determine psychological responses. The natural logarithm of the high-frequency component of HRV was significantly higher and heart rate was significantly lower when participants walked in the forest than when they walked in the urban environment. The questionnaire results indicated that, compared with the urban environment, walking in the forest increased "comfortable", "relaxed", "natural" and "vigorous" feelings and decreased "tension-anxiety," "depression," "anxiety-hostility," "fatigue" and "confusion". A brief walk in the forest elicited physiological and psychological relaxation effects on middle-aged hypertensive individuals.

Abstract: To develop an innovative information and communication technology (ICT) tool intended to help older people in their search for optimal housing solutions, a first step in the development process is to gain knowledge from the intended users. Thus the aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge about needs and expectations about housing options as expressed and prioritized by older people, people ageing with disabilities and professionals. A participatory design focus was adopted; 26 people with a range of functional limitations representing the user perspective and 15 professionals with a variety of backgrounds, participated in research circles that were conducted in four European countries. An additional 20 experts were invited as guests to the different research circle meetings. Three themes illustrating cross-national user priorities for housing provision and accessibility were identified: "Information barrier: accessible housing", "Information barrier: housing adaptation benefits", and "Cost barrier: housing adaptations". In conclusion, early user involvement and identification of cross-national differences in priorities and housing options will strengthen the development of a user-friendly ICT tool that can empower older people and people with disabilities to be more active consumers regarding housing provision.


Title #101: The Reactivity of 4-Hydroxy- and 4-Silyloxy-1,5-allenynes with Homogeneous Gold(I) Catalysts.
PMID: 25739001
Authors: Michael M. Wegener, Stefan F SF. Kirsch
Abstract: Two new gold(I)-catalyzed cascade reactions of 4-hydroxy- and 4-silyloxy-1,5-allenynes are disclosed, offering access to a variety of mono- and bicyclic, polyunsaturated carbonyl compounds. The diverse reactivity observed for the investigated allenyne system is controlled by the nature of the unsaturated substrate: Allenynes bearing a free hydroxyl group engage in what is likely an oxycyclization/allene-ene carbocyclization cascade, while their silylated analogues are converted through a carbocyclization/pinacol-type rearrangement process.


Title #102: Overexpression of ANO1/TMEM16A, an Arterial Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) Channel, Contributes to Spontaneous Hypertension.
PMID: 25739000
Authors: Bingxiang B. Wang, Chunlin C. Li, Ruituo R. Huai, Zhiqiang Z. Qu
Abstract: Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) have been implicated in hypertension; however, the mechanism underlying their involvement is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether the CaCC ANO1 is involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous hypertension. Arterial ANO1 expression and the effects on blood pressure (BP) of inhibiting ANO1 with an ANO1 inhibitor, T16Ainh-A01, and in vivo RNAi, were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Knockdown of ANO1 by siRNA prevented hypertensive development, and attenuation of ANO1 channel activity reduced BP in SHRs. Angiotensin II upregulated ANO1 expression in primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The protein level and activity of cellular ANO1 positively correlated with VSMC proliferation. Our data indicate an important role of increased ANO1 expression and activity in inducing hypertension in SHRs. It may mediate angiotensin II-dependent vascular remodeling. Our results increase the mechanistic understanding of hypertension and suggest ANO1 as a possible therapeutic target for hypertension.


Title #103: Metabolic control of cancer cell stemness: Lessons from iPS cells.
PMID: 25738999
Authors: Javier A JA. Menendez
Abstract: The Nobel prized discovery of nuclear reprogramming is swiftly providing mechanistic evidence of a role for metabolism in the generation of cancer stem cells (CSC). Traditionally, the metabolic demands of tumors have been viewed as drivers of the genetic programming detected in cancer tissues. Beyond the energetic requirements of specific cancer cell states, it is increasingly recognized that metabolism per se controls epi-transcriptional networks to dictate cancer cell fate, i.e., metabolism can define CSC. Here I review the CSC-related metabolic features found in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to provide an easily understandable framework in which the infrastructure and functioning of cellular metabolism might control the efficiency and kinetics of reprogramming in the re-routing of non-CSC to CSC-like cellular states. I suggest exploring how metabolism-dependent regulation of epigenetics can play a role in directing CSC states beyond conventional energetic demands of stage-specific cancer cell states, opening a new dimension of cancer in which the "physiological state" of CSC might be governed not only by cell-autonomous cues but also by local micro-environmental and systemic metabolo-epigenetic interactions. Forthcoming studies should decipher how specific metabolites integrate and mediate the overlap between the CSC-intrinsic "micro-epigenetics" and the "upstream" local and systemic "macro-epigenetics", thus paving the way for targeted epigenetic regulation of CSCs through metabolic modulation including "smart foods" or systemic "metabolic nichotherapies".


Title #104: High level of CFTR expression is associated with tumor aggression and knockdown of CFTR suppresses proliferation of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.
PMID: 25738998

Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, members of which are involved in various types of cancer. The relationship between CFTR and ovarian cancer remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of CFTR in human ovarian cancer tissues and its clinical significance in the progression of ovarian cancer. The role of CFTR in the malignant invasion, migration and proliferation of ovarian cancer inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo was also investigated. Immunohistochemical staining analysis was performed to detect the expression of CFTR in 83Â cases of human epithelial ovarian cancer specimens. Moreover, SKOV3 and A2780 stable cell lines containing shRNA gene specific for CFTR were established. Cell proliferation and motility were observed and compared with CFTR-RNAi cells. Tumorigenicity of CFTR-RNAi cells was investigated by tumor xenograft experiments conducted subcutaneously in nude mice. The expresssion of CFTR in ovarian cancer was significantly higher than that in benign ovarian tumor and normal ovariesÂ (P<0.05). In ovarian cancer, CFTR expression was significantly associated with advanced FIGO stage, poor histopathological grade and serum Ca-125 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we observed that CFTR staining was stronger in the serous type as compared to the other types (P<0.05). Compared with the negative control, decreased cell invasion, migration, proliferation, adhesion and colony formation were observed in CFTR-RNAi cells inÂ vitro. InÂ vivo, tumorigenic abilities of CFTR-RNAi cells were significantly repressed compared with that of the control groups. CFTR overexpression may play an important role in the development and progression of ovarian cancer. Additionally, the downregulation of CFTR suppresses aggressive malignant biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo.


Title #105: Psychosocial Factors in Disorders of Sex Development in a Long-Term Perspective: What Clinical Opportunities are there to Intervene?
PMID: 25738997
Authors: A. A. NordenstrÃ¶m
Abstract: Disorders or differences in sex development (DSD) comprise a wide spectrum of severity. The overall goal for the treatment and care is good quality of life but current knowledge concerning the psychosocial situation and health related quality of life for patients with different forms of DSD is limited. Follow-up studies have often focused on surgical results, sexual function, and psychosexual outcome and indicated unsatisfactory results in many cases. Epidemiological studies show less than optimal psychosocial situation for some of the diagnostic groups. Studies indicate that access to psychological support and understandable information is important for the outcome. Hormonal and surgical treatments are improving and new and better ways to strengthen the patient's ability to cope with the situation are needed. In a well-functioning multidisciplinary team, the patient's and family's needs should be identified. Tools to accomplish this can be developed. The care and our knowledge about disorders of sex development have developed considerably during the last decade. These are small patient groups with rare conditions that require specialized, highly qualified care in all aspects: medical, surgical, and psychological. It is important that changes in treatment practice are continuously evaluated.


Title #106: Expression Profile of Human Fc Receptor-Like 1, 2, and 4 Molecules in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Graves' Disease.
PMID: 25738996

Abstract: Recently identified Fc receptor-like (FCRL) molecules are new members of the immunoglobulin superfamily dominantly expressed by B cells. Although FCRL expression patterns have been studied in normal and malignant cells, their biological functions and roles remain to be clearly identified in humans. Research has particularly focused on FCRL gene polymorphisms in autoimmune diseases, however, their involvement in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is an interesting field for investigation. In the present study, we have investigated the gene expression profiles of FCRL1, 2, and 4 in 2 common thyroid diseases, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD). FCRL1, 2, and 4 expressions were determined in peripheral blood samples of 55 HT patients, 40 GD patients and equal numbers of normal subjects by quantitative real-time PCR. Our results showed downregulation of FCRL1 and upregulation of FCRL2 transcripts in both HT and GD groups compared to healthy counterparts. Overexpression of FCRL4 was observed only in GD patients compared to controls. A significant correlation was observed between all FCRL gene expression levels in HT patients. Only FCRL2 and 4 had a correlation in GD patients. In addition, FCRL1, 2, and 4 gene expressions showed no correlations with the level of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) or anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibody from patients' sera. In conclusion, expressions of activating or inhibitory FCRL1, 2, and 4 showed significant alterations in HT and GD patients compared to healthy subjects.


Title #107: Adrenal Insufficiency in Australia: Is it Possible that the Use of Lower Dose, Short-Acting Glucocorticoids has Increased the Risk of Adrenal Crises?
PMID: 25738995
Authors: R L RL. Rushworth, D J DJ. Torpy
Abstract: Morbidity from adrenal insufficiency (AI) in Australia is poorly described. The objective of this study was to evaluate AI morbidity patterns in adults between 1999/2000 and 2011/2012 using national databases. A descriptive study of hospitalisations for AI and adrenal crises (AC) in adults and trends in prescriptions for 2 short-acting glucocorticoids (GC) was designed. The setting was the Australian healthcare system. Main outcome measures are the trends in hospitalisation and prescription rates. There were 7â378 hospital admissions for treatment of AI in adults between 1999/00 and 2011/12. Of these, 29.5% were for an AC. Admission rates for AC increased from 9.5 to 12.4 admissions/10(6)/year (p<0.05). There was a 5.8% decrease in admission rates for AI (excluding AC), from 27.0 to 25.5/10(6)/year (p=ns). Short-acting GC [hydrocortisone (HCT) and cortisone acetate (CA)] prescription rates increased significantly (p<0.001) from 3â176.1/10(6) to 3â463.8/10(6). Prescription rates for CA decreased by 22.4% (p<0.001) but HCT prescription rates increased to 77.1% (p<0.001). The increase in AC admission rates was positively correlated with the rise in both the total GC prescription rate (r=0.63, p<0.05) and the HCT prescription rate (r=0.74, p<0.01). Over the 13-year study period, there was a 30.8% increase in hospitalisation rates for ACs and a concomitant 77.1% increase in prescribing of HCT. The association between AC events and HCT use and/or reduced effective GC dose is plausibly causal, but confirmatory studies are required before suggesting any change to GC replacement in AI.


Title #108: Two Novel Mutations in the Thyroid Hormone Receptor Î² in Patients with Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH Î²): Clinical, Biochemical, and Molecular Data.
PMID: 25738994
Authors: A M AM. Esquiaveto-Aun, D E DE. Zantut-Wittmann, R J RJ. Petroli, B S L BS. Nakano, G. G. Guerra-JÃºnior, S H V SH. de Lemos-Marini, M P MP. de Mello
Abstract: The syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH Î²) is an inherited disorder characterized by variable tissue hyposensitivity to 3,5,30-l-triiodothyronine (T3), with persistent elevation of free-circulating T3 (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels in association with nonsuppressed serum thyrotropin (TSH). Clinical presentation is variable and the molecular analysis of THRB gene provides a short cut diagnosis. Here, we describe 2 cases in which RTH Î² was suspected on the basis of laboratory findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct THRB sequencing that revealed 2 novel mutations: the heterozygous p.Ala317Ser in subject 1 and the heterozygous p.Arg438Pro in subject 2. Both mutations were shown to be deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen, and Align GV-GD predictive methods.


Title #109: Antibacterial alkaloids from Artabotrys crassifolius Hook.f. & Thomson.
PMID: 25738993
Authors: Kok Kwan KK. Tan, Teng Jing TJ. Khoo, Mogana M. Rajagopal, Christophe C. Wiart
Abstract: Chloroform extract of bark of Artabotrys crassifolius Hook.f. & Thomson exhibited antibacterial activities against both American Type Culture Collection and clinical bacterial strains in vitro with zones of inhibition ranging from 7 to 14Â mm. Further analysis of this extract yielded artabotrine, liridine, lysicamine and atherospermidine. Artabotrine displayed a broad array of antibacterial activity mostly against Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 1.25Â Î¼g/mL to 5Â Î¼g/mL. Of note, artabotrine, liridine and lysicamine are bactericidal against Gram-negative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella with MIC values equal 2.5, 2.5 and 10Â Î¼g/mL, respectively, and minimum bactericidal concentrations values equal to 2.5, 5 and 20Â Î¼g/mL.


Title #110: Aprotinin revisited: formulation, characterization, biodistribution and therapeutic potential of new aprotinin microemulsion in acute pancreatitis.

Abstract: Abstract The aim of this study was to develop aprotinin-loaded microemulsion (MA) for intravenous administration and evaluate the biodistribution and therapeutic potential of developed formulation in acute pancreatitis models in rats. Phase diagrams were constructed to identify microemulsion region and the optimal microemulsion was evaluated for physicochemical properties and treatment effect in rats, and comparisons made with the solution of aprotinin (SA). To evaluate the biodistribution of the drug by gamma scintigraphy aprotinin was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc radionuclide. Mild and severe acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by subcutaneous injections of cerulein and introductal infusion of 3% sodium taurocholate into the bile-pancreatic duct, respectively. In addition, serum amylase and pancreatic tissue myeloperoxidase activities were measured to evaluate the pancreatic damage. According to gamma scintigraphy and biodistribution studies, accumulation times and distribution of (99m)Tc-MA and SA were different. While MA was highly uptake by reticuloendothelial system, SA was mostly excreted by kidneys and bladder. Compared with the mild acute pancreatitis group, treatment with MA significantly decreased the serum amylase activity and pancreas myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, the protease inhibitor molecule aprotinin has therapeutic potential in acute pancreatitis. Finally, MA may be suggested as a promising alternative for treatment of acute pancreatitis.

Abstract: Abstract Among the materials for preparing the polymeric nanocarriers, poly(n-butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA), a polymer with medium length alkyl side chain, is of lower toxicity and proper degradation time. Therefore, PBCA has recently been regarded as a kind of widely used, biocompatible, biodegradable, low-toxic drug carrier. This review highlights the use of PBCA-based nanocarriers (PBCA-NCs) as targeting drug delivery systems and presents the methods of preparation, the surface modification and the advantages and limitations of PBCA-NCs. The drugs loaded in PBCA-NCs are summarized according to the treatment of diseases, and the different therapeutic applications and the most recent developments of PBCA-NCs are also discussed, which provides useful guidance on the targeting research of PBCA-NCs.


Title #112: Effective photothermal chemotherapy with docetaxel-loaded gold nanospheres in advanced prostate cancer.
PMID: 25738990

Abstract: Abstract Background: Multifunctional gold nanospheres (MGNs)-loaded with docetaxel (MGN@DTX) were prepared and evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in nude mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts. Methods: MGNs were prepared from PEGylated hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs) coated with folic acid and DTPTT chelate. Then, the effect of radiolabelled MGNs ((99m)Tc-MGNs) on PC-3 cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, while their binding affinity to these cells was evaluated by cell binding assays. Next, biodistribution of (99m)Tc-MGNs in xenograft bearing mice was measured by SPECT imaging. Also, DTX loading and release rates were estimated in MGN@DTX. Finally, in vitro stability in human serum and cytotoxicity of MGN@DTX were assessed, as well as their antitumor effect in xenograft bearing mice. Results: (99m)Tc-MGNs (97.69% purity) showed good binding affinity to PC-3 cells, a specific recognition blocked by excess folic acid. Interestingly, MGN@DTX remained stable in human serum for 24 h, and exhibited higher mean cytotoxicity after NIR laser irradiation than free DTX. By day 28, tumor inhibition rates were higher in the MGN@DTXâ+âNIR laser irradiation group compared with the DTX and MGNsâ+âNIR laser irradiation groups. Conclusions: Loading chemotherapeutic drugs into MGNs can increase antitumor potency, reduce normal cell damage and decrease drug resistance, thus representing a promising approach for advanced prostate cancer treatment.


Title #113: A Predictive In Vitro Model of the Impact of Drugs with Anticholinergic Properties on Human Neuronal and Astrocytic Systems.

Abstract: The link between off-target anticholinergic effects of medications and acute cognitive impairment in older adults requires urgent investigation. We aimed to determine whether a relevant in vitro model may aid the identification of anticholinergic responses to drugs and the prediction of anticholinergic risk during polypharmacy. In this preliminary study we employed a co-culture of human-derived neurons and astrocytes (NT2.N/A) derived from the NT2 cell line. NT2.N/A cells possess much of the functionality of mature neurons and astrocytes, key cholinergic phenotypic markers and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). The cholinergic response of NT2 astrocytes to the mAChR agonist oxotremorine was examined using the fluorescent dye fluo-4 to quantitate increases in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. Inhibition of this response by drugs classified as severe (dicycloverine, amitriptyline), moderate (cyclobenzaprine) and possible (cimetidine) on the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, was examined after exposure to individual and pairs of compounds. Individually, dicycloverine had the most significant effect regarding inhibition of the astrocytic cholinergic response to oxotremorine, followed by amitriptyline then cyclobenzaprine and cimetidine, in agreement with the ACB scale. In combination, dicycloverine with cyclobenzaprine had the most significant effect, followed by dicycloverine with amitriptyline. The order of potency of the drugs in combination frequently disagreed with predicted ACB scores derived from summation of the individual drug scores, suggesting current scales may underestimate the effect of polypharmacy. Overall, this NT2.N/A model may be appropriate for further investigation of adverse anticholinergic effects of multiple medications, in order to inform clinical choices of suitable drug use in the elderly.

Title #116: Basic fibroblast growth factor lentiviral vector-transfected sheep bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and non-specific osteogenic gene expression.
PMID: 25738986
Authors: Yang Y. Hu, Qin Q. Zhang, Lei L. Zhang, Xiao-Xue XX. Tang, Hui-Yu HY. He
Abstract: In the present study, sheep bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)âlentivirus in order to investigate the influence of bFGF on osteogenic gene expression. bFGFâtransfected BMSCs (experimental group) and nonâtransfected BMSCs (control group) were also transfected with a green fluorescent protein gene in order to measure the transfection efficiency of the (bFGF)âlentivirus using flow cytometry. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays, the changes in expression from three genes (osteopontin, OPN; osteocalcin, OC; and collagenâI) in BMSCs from the experimental and control groups were measured. Transfection efficiency was 87.3% in the experimental group and 1.1% in the control group. OPNÂ gene expression was high in BMSCs from the experimental group. However, there was no significant difference in OPN expression between BMSCs from the control and experimental groupÂ (P>0.05). Collagenââ  expression was significantly lower in the experimental group compared with that in the control groupsÂ (P<0.05). By contrast, OC expression was significantly higher in BMSCs from the experimental group compared with that in the control groupÂ (P<0.05). Changes in osteogenic gene expression indicated that the BMSCs from the experimental group had better osteogenic ability, as compared with the control cells. Therefore, bFGFâtransfected cells may be useful seed cells for bone tissue engineering.


Title #117: A Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructure-Based MicroRNA Biosensor Coupled with Catalytic Recycling of the Analyte.
PMID: 25738985
Authors: Peng P. Miao, Bidou B. Wang, Xifeng X. Chen, Xiaoxi X. Li, Yuguo Y. Tang
Abstract: MicroRNAs are not only important regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, but also identified as promising disease biomarkers. Due to the low contents in serum, microRNAs are always difficult to be accurately detected. In this paper, an electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of microRNA based on tetrahedral DNA nanostructure is developed. Four DNA single strands are engineered to form a tetrahedral nanostructure with a pendant stem-loop, and modified on a gold electrode surface, which largely enhances the molecular recognition efficiency. Moreover, taking advantage of strand displacement polymerization, catalytic recycling of microRNA, as well as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based solid-state Ag/AgCl reaction, the proposed biosensor exhibits high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.4 fM. This biosensor shows great clinical value and may have practical utility in early diagnosis and prognosis of certain diseases.

Title #119: An investigation into the Mechanism and the Microstructure of Reaction Intermediates in the Two-phase Synthesis of Alkanethiol-capped Silver Nanoparticles.
PMID: 25738982
Authors: Farhad F. Faghihi, Paul P. Hazendonk, Tony T. Montina
Abstract: To gain better control over the characteristics of the alkanethiol-capped silver nanoparticles (SNP) prepared by the two-phase method, the intermediate stage of this reaction and the structure of the precursor compound were investigated. Samples taken from the intermediate stage of the reaction were analyzed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopies both in solution and after solvent removal. The 1H NMR chemical shifts of the complexes formed during the phase transfer step were used to detect any structural changes that occur upon introduction of nonanethiol. Moreover, the presence of the silver-thiolate was monitored by comparing the FTIR and Raman spectra of silver-nonanethiolate with the dried samples. Further insights into the microstructure of the intermediate compounds were sought by characterizing samples differing in molar ratios of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) to silver nitrate (AgNO3). 13C solid-state NMR chemical shifts, 13C relaxation times, and the DSC transitions of these samples revealed a dependence of their phase structure on the initial concentration of the reagents. At least two phases with distinct mobility and conformational ordering of their octyl chains were identified in the samples prepared with excess TOAB, which was associated with the presence of multiple anionic species. The observations regarding the composition of the phase transfer product were further related to the quality of the resulting nanoparticles. It was demonstrated that a large excess of TOAB, which is commonly used in two-phase methods, can be avoided without compromising the size and polydispersity of the silver nanoparticles produced. This modification to the synthetic procedure simplifies the purification of the product, mitigates the propensity of the nanoparticles for aggregation, and facilitates their resuspension.

Abstract: Based on evidence of survival benefit when initiating hemodialysis (HD) via arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) vs hemodialysis catheter (HC), the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative published practice guidelines in 1997 recommending 50% or greater AVF rates in incident HD patients. A decade after, lapses exist and the impact on HD outcomes is uncertain.


Title #121: Are the Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire Scales stable or transient?
PMID: 25738980
Authors: Alan M AM. Nevill, Andrew M AM. Lane, Michael J MJ. Duncan
Abstract: Body image is an important concept when assessing mental health and, thus, a target for intervention work. The common approach to assess body image is via self-report and, consequently, it is important to assess stability and susceptibility of items to random change. Participants (NÂ =Â 99, aged: 18-30Â years) completed the 34-item Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) twice, separated by two weeks. Stability was quantified by calculating the test-retest differences for each item, with a stable item showing 90% of respondents' differences within a criterion ofÂ â¤Â±1. This method was used in preference to correlation, which is a test of association rather than agreement. Analyses identified 29 stable items. Five items were found to be unstable including the entire "Appearance Evaluation" scale. One particular unstable question, Q9Â =Â "Most people would consider me good-looking", revealed strong associations with both gender and weight status. Forty-four per cent of "overweight" respondents changed their minds by more thanÂ Â±1 compared with only 10% of "normal-weight" participants, suggesting that being overweight is associated with uncertainty and instability. We suggest that future research is needed to investigate why such factors as being overweight appear to be linked to instability in self-report measures of body image.


Title #122: Engineering Enhanced Protein Disaggregases for Neurodegenerative Disease.
PMID: 25738979
Authors: Meredith E ME. Jackrel, James J. Shorter
Abstract: Protein misfolding and aggregation underpin several fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). There are no treatments that directly antagonize the protein-misfolding events that cause these disorders. Agents that reverse protein misfolding and restore proteins to native form and function could simultaneously eliminate any deleterious loss-of-function or toxic gain-of-function caused by misfolded conformers. Moreover, a disruptive technology of this nature would eliminate self-templating conformers that spread pathology and catalyze formation of toxic, soluble oligomers. Here, we highlight our efforts to engineer Hsp104, a protein disaggregase from yeast, to more effectively disaggregate misfolded proteins connected with PD, ALS, and FTD. Remarkably subtle modifications of Hsp104 primary sequence yielded large gains in protective activity against deleterious Î±-synuclein, TDP-43, FUS, and TAF15 misfolding. Unusually, in many cases loss of amino acid identity at select positions in Hsp104 rather than specific mutation conferred a robust therapeutic gain-of-function. Nevertheless, the misfolding and toxicity of EWSR1, an RNA-binding protein with a prion-like domain linked to ALS and FTD, could not be buffered by potentiated Hsp104 variants, indicating that further amelioration of disaggregase activity or sharpening of substrate specificity is warranted. We suggest that neuroprotection is achievable for diverse neurodegenerative conditions via surprisingly subtle structural modifications of existing chaperones.


Title #123: Sensory Integration and Response to Balance Perturbation in Overweight Physically Active Individuals.
PMID: 25738978
Authors: Peggy Py PP. Cheung, Liane B LB. Azevedo
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare sensory integration and response to balance perturbation between physically active normal weight and overweight adults. Physically active young adults were grouped into normal weight (n = 45) or overweight (n = 17) according to the World Health Organization body mass index classification for Asian adults. Participants underwent two balance tests: sensory organization and motor control. Overweight participants presented marginally lower somatosensory score compared to normal weight participants. However, they scored significantly higher in response to balance perturbation. There was no difference in the onset of participants' active response to balance perturbation. Physical activity might have contributed to improved muscle strength and improved the ability of overweight individuals to maintain balance.


Title #124: Buffer-Induced Swelling and Vesicle Budding in Binary Lipid Mixtures of Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:Lysophosphatidylcholine Using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering and (31)P Static NMR.
PMID: 25738977
Authors: Hanna M G HM. Barriga, Richard R. Bazin, Richard H RH. Templer, Robert V RV. Law, Oscar O. Ces
Abstract: A large variety of data exists on lipid phase behavior; however, it is mostly in nonbuffered systems over nonbiological temperature ranges. We present biophysical data on lipid mixtures of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) examining their behaviors in excess water and buffer systems over the temperature range 4-34 Â°C. These mixtures are commonly used to investigate the effects of spontaneous curvature on integral membrane proteins. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and (31)P NMR, we observed lamellar and vesicle phases, with the buffer causing an increase in the layer spacing. Increasing amounts of DOPE in a DOPC bilayer decreased the layer spacing of the mesophase, while the opposite trend was observed for increasing amounts of LysoPC. (31)P static NMR was used to analyze the DOPC:LysoPC samples to investigate the vesicle sizes present, with evidence of vesicle budding observed at LysoPC concentrations above 30 mol %. NMR line shapes were fitted using an adapted program accounting for the distortion of the lipids within the magnetic field. The distortion of the vesicle, because of magnetic susceptibility, varied with LysoPC content, and a discontinuity was found in both the water and buffer samples. Generally, the distortion increased with LysoPC content; however, at a ratio of DOPC:LysoPC 60:40, the sample showed a level of distortion of the vesicle similar to that of pure DOPC. This implies an increased flexibility in the membrane at this point. Commonly, the assumption is that for increasing LysoPC concentration there is a reduction in membrane tension, implying that estimations of membrane tension based on spontaneous curvature assumptions may not be accurate.


Title #125: Anti-inflammatory effects of methanol extract of Canarium lyi C.D. Dai & Yakovlev in RAW 264.7 macrophages and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury.
PMID: 25738976

Abstract: Canarium lyi C.D. Dai & Yakovlev (CL) is a member of the Anacardiaceae family. To the best of our knowledge, no studies on its anti-inflammatory effects have yet been reported. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of CL on inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mice. CL attenuated the production of LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1Î², and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, CL suppressed phosphorylation of the inhibitor ÎºB-Î± (IÎºB-Î±), p38, c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), as well as the translocation of the nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) p65 subunit into the nucleus. For the inÂ vivo efficacy, the effect of CL on a mouse model of LPS-induced acute lung injury was assessed. CL treatment of the mice significantly inhibited the inflammatory cell recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). CL-treated mice also showed a marked inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and phosphorylation of IÎºB and p65. In addition, CL attenuated lung histopathological changes in LPS-induced ALI mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that CL is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including pneumonia.


Title #126: Associations between muscle strength asymmetry and impairments in gait and posture in young brain-injured patients.
PMID: 25738975

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to deficits in gait and posture which are often asymmetric. A possible factor mediating these deficits may be asymmetry in strength of the leg muscles. However, muscle strength in the lower extremities has rarely been investigated in (young) TBI patients. Here, we investigated associations between lower extremity muscle weakness, strength asymmetry and impairments in gait and posture in young TBI patients. A group of young patients with moderate to severe TBI (n=19, age 14y 11m Â± 2y) and a group of typically developing subjects (n=31, age 14y 1m Â± 3y) participated in this study. A force platform was used to measure postural sway to quantify balance control during normal standing and during conditions of compromised visual and/or somatosensory feedback. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were assessed during comfortable and fast-speed walking, using an electronic walkway. Muscle strength in 4 lower extremity muscle groups was measured bilaterally using a hand-held dynamometer. Findings revealed that TBI patients had poorer postural balance scores across all sensory conditions as compared to typically developing subjects. During comfortable and fast gait, TBI patients demonstrated a lower gait velocity, longer double support phase and increased step length asymmetry. Furthermore, the TBI patients had a reduced strength of the leg muscles and an increased strength asymmetry. Correlation analyses revealed that asymmetry in muscle strength was predictive of a poorer balance control and a more variable and asymmetric gait. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure strength asymmetry in the leg muscles of a sample of TBI patients and to illustrate the importance of muscular asymmetry as a potential marker and possible risk factor of impairments in the control of posture and gait.


Title #127: Comparison of hIGF-1 Gene Transfection to the hBMSCs and Human Meniscal Fibrochondrocytes.
PMID: 25738974
Authors: Haining H. Zhang, Ping P. Leng, Tian T. He, Yingzhen Y. Wang
Abstract: Background Treatment strategies for meniscal injury are shifting from meniscectomy to repair, especially cell-based therapy. Delivering selected genes to donor cells can modify differentiation and proliferation. Efficiency of gene transfection and expression may relate to cell type. Material and Methods Full-length hIGF-1 cDNA was cloned into eukaryotic expression vector by PCR. Human BMSCs and meniscal fibrochondrocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro and hIGF-1 gene was transfected by FuGene 6. Expression of EGFP and hIGF-1 were determined. Biological activity of the hIGF-1 in medium was assessed by MTT chromatometry. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to assess the expression of exogenous genes. Efficacy of gene transfection was detected by immunohistochemistry staining and flow cytometry. Results Sequences of hIGF-1 were verified by sequence analysis. Expression of EGFP increased gradually and reached peak intensity 48 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency of BMSCs was higher than meniscal fibrochondrocytes. The population doubling time was decreased in both cell types. Peak concentration of hIGF-1 in the medium of BMSCs and meniscal cells was 32.5Â±4.8 ng/ml and 24.5Â±4.6 ng/ml, respectively. Secreted hIGF-1 possessed the ability to enhance proliferation of the cell line. Results of qPCR and Western blot confirmed the expression of hIGF-1. Type II collagen appeared within the cells, and percentage of cells in S stage was increased in both cell types after transfection. Conclusions hIGF-1 cDNA can be transfected into BMSCs and meniscal fibrochondrocytes, resulting in gene expression. Expression efficiency in BMSCs was higher than that in fibrochondrocytes.

Abstract: Manipulation of individual graphene sheets/films into specific architectures at macroscopic scales is crucially important for practical uses of graphene. We present herein a versatile and robust method based on annealing of solid carbon precursors on nickel templates and thermo-assisted removal of poly methyl methacrylate under low vacuum of ~0.6 Pa for fabrication of macroscopic, freestanding, and tubular graphene (TG) architectures. Specifically, the TG architectures can be obtained as individual and woven tubes with diameter of ~50 Âµm, wall thickness in the range of 2.1 - 2.9 nm, density of ~1.53 mgâcm-3, thermal stability up to 600 oC in air, electrical conductivity of ~1.48 Ã 106 Sâm-1, and field emission current densities in order of 104 Aâcm-2 at low applied electrical fields of 0.6 - 0.7 VâÂµm-1. These properties show great promise for applications in flexible and lightweight electronics, electron guns or X-ray tube sources.


Title #129: Mobile phone radiation causes brain tumors and should be classified as a probable human carcinogen (2A) (Review).
PMID: 25738972
Authors: L Lloyd LL. Morgan, Anthony B AB. Miller, Annie A. Sasco, Devra Lee DL. Davis
Abstract: Quickly changing technologies and intensive uses of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF)âemitting phones pose a challenge to public health. Mobile phone users and uses and exposures to other wireless transmitting devices (WTDs) have increased in the past few years. We consider that CERENAT, a French national study, provides an important addition to the literature evaluating the use of mobile phones and risk of brain tumors. The CERENAT finding of increased risk of glioma is consistent with studies that evaluated use of mobile phones for a decade or longer and corroborate those that have shown a risk of meningioma from mobile phone use. In CERENAT, exposure to RFâEMF from digitally enhanced cordless telephones (DECTs), used by over half the population of France during the period of this study, was not evaluated. If exposures to DECT phones could have been taken into account, the risks of glioma from mobile phone use in CERENAT are likely to be higher than published. We conclude that radiofrequency fields should be classified as a Group 2A ÌprobableÌ human carcinogen under the criteria used by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Lyon, France). Additional data should be gathered on exposures to mobile and cordless phones, other WTDs, mobile phone base stations and WiâFi routers to evaluate their impact on public health. We advise that the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle be adopted for uses of this technology, while a major crossâdisciplinary effort is generated to train researchers in bioelectromagnetics and provide monitoring of potential health impacts of RFâEMF.


Title #130: Antiproliferative effects of anastrozole on MCFâ7 human breast cancer cells inÂ vitro are significantly enhanced by combined treatment with testosterone undecanoate.
PMID: 25738971
Authors: Rong R. Chen, Junwei J. Cui, Qinqin Q. Wang, Peng P. Li, Xiaoling X. Liu, Hui H. Hu, Wei W. Wei
Abstract: The present study aimed to assess the effects of aromatase inhibitor anastrozole and testosterone undecanoate, separately and in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis in MCFâ7 human breast cancerÂ cells cultured inÂ vitro. The effects of various concentrations of these drugs on the proliferation of MCFâ7Â cells were evaluated by CCK8 assay, the levels of cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry with AnnexinâV/propidium iodide staining and androgen receptor (AR) protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. The results of the CCK8 assay indicated that greater antiproliferative activity was detected in the MCFâ7Â cells in the combined treatment groups, compared with those treated with anastrozole or testosterone undecanoate alone. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis revealed that treatment with a combination of the two drugs generated a higher percentage of apoptotic cells, particularly when the two drugs were applied for 48Â h, compared with single drug treatment. Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in AR protein expression in the combined treatment groups compared with MCF7Â cells treated with single drugs. The results of the present study provided evidence supporting the potential of a combination of anastrozole and testosterone undecanoate as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the antiproliferative effects of anastrozole were significantly enhanced by combined treatment with testosterone undecanoate via the AR signaling pathway.


Title #131: Afzelin attenuates asthma phenotypes by downregulation of GATA3 in a murine model of asthma.
PMID: 25738969
Authors: Wenbo W. Zhou, Xiuhong X. Nie
Abstract: Asthma is a serious health problem causing significant mortality and morbidity globally. Persistent airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, increased immunoglobulinÂ E (IgE) levels and mucus hypersecretion are key characteristics of the condition. Asthma is mediated via a dominant TâhelperÂ 2 (Th2) immune response, causing enhanced expression of Th2 cytokines. These cytokines are responsible for the various pathological changes associated with allergic asthma. To investigate the antiâasthmatic potential of afzelin, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved, its antiâasthmatic potential were investigated in a murine model of asthma. In the present study, BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized using ovalbumin (OVA) followed by aerosol allergen challenges. The effect of afzelin on airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic infiltration, Th2 cytokine and OVAâspecific IgE production in a mouse model of asthma were investigated. It was found that afzelinâtreated groups suppressed eosinophil infiltration, allergic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, OVAâspecific IgE and Th2 cytokine secretion. The results of the present study suggested that the therapeutic mechanism by which afzelin effectively treats asthma is based on reduction of Th2 cytokine via inhibition of GATAâbinding proteinÂ 3 transcription factor, which is the master regulator of Th2 cytokine differentiation and production.


Title #132: What Controls the Hybridization Thermodynamics of Spherical Nucleic Acids?
PMID: 25738968
Authors: Pratik S PS. Randeria, Matthew R MR. Jones, Kevin L KL. Kohlstedt, Resham J RJ. Banga, Monica M. Olvera de la Cruz, George C GC. Schatz, Chad A CA. Mirkin
Abstract: The hybridization of free oligonucleotides to densely packed, oriented arrays of DNA modifying the surfaces of spherical nucleic acid (SNA)-gold nanoparticle conjugates occurs with negative cooperativity; i.e., each binding event destabilizes subsequent binding events. DNA hybridization is thus an ever-changing function of the number of strands already hybridized to the particle. Thermodynamic quantification of this behavior reveals a 3 orders of magnitude decrease in the binding constant for the capture of a free oligonucleotide by an SNA conjugate as the fraction of pre-hybridized strands increases from 0 to â¼30%. Increasing the number of pre-hybridized strands imparts an increasing enthalpic penalty to hybridization that makes binding more difficult, while simultaneously decreasing the entropic penalty to hybridization, which makes binding more favorable. Hybridization of free DNA to an SNA is thus governed by both an electrostatic barrier as the SNA accumulates charge with additional binding events and an effect consistent with allostery, where hybridization at certain sites on an SNA modify the binding affinity at a distal site through conformational changes to the remaining single strands. Leveraging these insights allows for the design of conjugates that hybridize free strands with significantly higher efficiencies, some of which approach 100%.


Title #133: The origins of the quinolone class of antibacterials: an expanded "discovery story"
PMID: 25738967
Authors: Gregory Stuart GS. Bisacchi
Abstract: Published descriptions of the specific lines of research leading to the discovery of therapeutically important medicines, especially major new class medicines, have long provided value to the biopharmaceutical community as models of success, often influencing the strategies and methods of subsequent drug research. Quinolone antibacterials represent one of medicine's most important classes of anti-infective agents, yet in contrast to many other classes of anti-infectives, astonishingly few details concerning the origin of the class or the rationale leading to the selection of the first clinical agent, nalidixic acid, were ever published by the discoverers. Moreover, earlier disclosures of an independent discovery of the quinolone class of antibacterials have been almost entirely overlooked by the scientific literature. This review brings together all the available information from primary literature sources relating to both discoveries, and provides for the first time a much fuller, if still partially speculative, story of the earliest years of this important class of drugs.


Title #134: Sophorolipid biosurfactants: Possible uses as antibacterial and antibiofilm agent.
PMID: 25738966
Authors: Mayri A MA. DÃ­az De R, Ibrahim M IM. Banat, Ben B. Dolman, James J. Winterburn, Peter J PJ. Martin
Abstract: Biosurfactants are amphipathic, surface-active molecules of microbial origin which accumulate at interfaces reducing interfacial tension and leading to the formation of aggregated micellular structures in solution. Some biosurfactants have been reported to have antimicrobial properties, the ability to prevent adhesion and to disrupt biofilm formation. We investigated antimicrobial properties and biofilm disruption using sophorolipids at different concentrations. Growth of Gram negative Cupriavidus necator ATCC 17699 and Gram positive Bacillus subtilis BBK006 were inhibited by sophorolipids at concentrations of 5% v/v with a bactericidal effect. Sophorolipids (5% v/v) were also able to disrupt biofilms formed by single and mixed cultures of Bacillus subtilis BBK006 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 under static and flow conditions, as was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that sophorolipids may be promising compounds for use in biomedical application as adjuvants to other antimicrobial against some pathogens through inhibition of growth and/or biofilm disruption.


Title #135: Protective role of isoflurane pretreatment in rats with focal cerebral ischemia and the underlying molecular mechanism.
PMID: 25738964

Abstract: Inflammation and immunity are important in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Tollâlike receptorÂ 4 (TLR4) is involved in the inflammatory responses of injured brain tissues. Emerging studies have focused on the effect of isoflurane (ISO) pretreatment on cerebral ischemia, however, the association between ISO pretreatment and TLR4 during cerebral ischemia remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the protective role of ISO pretreatment in rats with focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion was investigated and the molecular mechanism was discussed. Using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was utilized to measure the infarct volume and brain edema and immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the MCAOâinduced TLR4 expression and localization. Western blot analyses were conducted to quantify the protein expression levels of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary responseÂ 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor (NF)âÎºB in ischemic brain tissue at different time points. The results demonstrated that, following ISO pretreatment, the neurological deficits, brain edema and cerebral infarct size caused by ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated. The astrocyte and microglial activation in the brain tissue was decreased. In addition, the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NFâÎºB were decreased. The present study indicated that ISO pretreatment may protect the brain from ischemic damage by downregulating the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NFâÎºB.

Abstract: Low vision in childhood is a significant barrier to learning and development, particularly for reading and education. Optical low vision aids may be used to maximise the child's functional vision. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously highlighted the importance of the use of low vision aids in managing children with visual impairment across the world.


Title #137: Sensing Cytosolic RpsL by Macrophages Induces Lysosomal Cell Death and Termination of Bacterial Infection.
PMID: 25738962
Authors: Wenhan W. Zhu, Lili L. Tao, Marsha L ML. Quick, Johanna A JA. Joyce, Jie-Ming JM. Qu, Zhao-Qing ZQ. Luo
Abstract: The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila provokes strong host responses and has proven to be a valuable model for the discovery of novel immunosurveillance pathways. Our previous work revealed that an environmental isolate of L. pneumophila induces a noncanonical form of cell death, leading to restriction of bacterial replication in primary mouse macrophages. Here we show that such restriction also occurs in infections with wild type clinical isolates. Importantly, we found that a lysine to arginine mutation at residue 88 (K88R) in the ribosome protein RpsL that not only confers bacterial resistance to streptomycin, but more importantly, severely attenuated the induction of host cell death and enabled L. pneumophila to replicate in primary mouse macrophages. Although conferring similar resistance to streptomycin, a K43N mutation in RpsL does not allow productive intracellular bacterial replication. Further analysis indicated that RpsL is capable of effectively inducing macrophage death via a pathway involved in lysosomal membrane permeabilization; the K88R mutant elicits similar responses but is less potent. Moreover, cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease that causes cell death after being released into the cytosol upon the loss of membrane integrity, is required for efficient RpsL-induced macrophage death. Furthermore, despite the critical role of cathepsin B in delaying RpsL-induced cell death, macrophages lacking cathepsin B do not support productive intracellular replication of L. pneumophila harboring wild type RpsL. This suggests the involvement of other yet unidentified components in the restriction of bacterial replication. Our results identified RpsL as a regulator in the interactions between bacteria such as L. pneumophila and primary mouse macrophages by triggering unique cellular pathways that restrict intracellular bacterial replication.


Title #138: Looking MÄori Predicts Decreased Rates of Home Ownership: Institutional Racism in Housing Based on Perceived Appearance.
PMID: 25738961
Authors: Carla A CA. Houkamau, Chris G CG. Sibley
Abstract: This study examined differences in rates of home ownership among MÄori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand). We identified systematic factors that predicted why some MÄori were more likely to own their own home (partially or fully) relative to other MÄori. Data were drawn from a large national postal sample of 561 self-identified MÄori collected as part of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. As predicted, our analyses indicated that self-reported appearance as MÄori, or the extent to which people thought they personally displayed features which visibly identified them as MÄori to others, significantly predicted decreased rates of home ownership. This association held when adjusting for numerous demographic covariates, such as education, level of deprivation of the immediate area, household income, age, relationship status, region of residence, and so forth. Our analyses suggest there is, or at least has been in the recent past, institutional racism against MÄori in New Zealand's home lending industry based on merely appearing more MÄori.


Title #139: Pregnant women's experiences of male partner involvement in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission in Khayelitsha, South Africa.

Abstract: Male partner involvement (MPI) has been identified as a priority intervention in programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, but rates of MPI remain low worldwide. This study used a quantitative survey (n = 170) and two focus group discussions (FGDs) with 16 HIV-positive pregnant women attending a public sector antenatal care service in Khayelitsha, South Africa, to examine the determinants of high levels of involvement and generate a broader understanding of women's experiences of MPI during pregnancy. Among survey participants, 74% had disclosed their status to their partner, and most reported high levels of communication around HIV testing and preventing partner transmission, as well as high levels of MPI. High MPI was significantly more likely among women who were cohabiting with their partner; who had reportedly disclosed their HIV status to their partner; and who reported higher levels of HIV-related communication with their partner. FGD participants discussed a range of ways in which partners can be supportive during pregnancy, not limited to male attendance of antenatal care. MPI appears to be a feasible intervention in this context, and MPI interventions should aim to encourage male partner attendance of antenatal care as well as greater involvement in pregnancy more generally. Interventions that target communication are needed to facilitate HIV-related communication and disclosure within couples. MPI should remain a priority intervention in PMTCT programmes, and increased efforts should be made to promote MPI in PMTCT.


Title #140: Rapid Evolution of Recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Xylose Fermentation through Formation of Extra-chromosomal Circular DNA.

Abstract: Circular DNA elements are involved in genome plasticity, particularly of tandem repeats. However, amplifications of DNA segments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported so far involve pre-existing repetitive sequences such as ribosomal DNA, Ty elements and Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs). Here, we report the generation of an eccDNA, (extrachromosomal circular DNA element) in a region without any repetitive sequences during an adaptive evolution experiment. We performed whole genome sequence comparison between an efficient D-xylose fermenting yeast strain developed by metabolic and evolutionary engineering, and its parent industrial strain. We found that the heterologous gene XylA that had been inserted close to an ARS sequence in the parent strain has been amplified about 9 fold in both alleles of the chromosomal locus of the evolved strain compared to its parent. Analysis of the amplification process during the adaptive evolution revealed formation of a XylA-carrying eccDNA, pXI2-6, followed by chromosomal integration in tandem arrays over the course of the evolutionary adaptation. Formation of the eccDNA occurred in the absence of any repetitive DNA elements, probably using a micro-homology sequence of 8 nucleotides flanking the amplified sequence. We isolated the pXI2-6 eccDNA from an intermediate strain of the evolutionary adaptation process, sequenced it completely and showed that it confers high xylose fermentation capacity when it is transferred to a new strain. In this way, we have provided clear evidence that gene amplification can occur through generation of eccDNA without the presence of flanking repetitive sequences and can serve as a rapid means of adaptation to selection pressure.


Title #141: Expression of Hypoxic Marker Carbonic Anhydrase IX Predicts Poor Prognosis in Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PMID: 25738958

Abstract: Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), a hypoxia marker, correlates with tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. However, the role of CA-IX in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) remains largely unknown. We examined the expression of 277 unifocal, resectable, primary HCC tumors using immunohistochemistry. The CA-IX protein was expressed in 110 of the 227 (48.5%) HCC tumors. The expression of CA-IX correlated with younger age (P = 0.0446), female sex (P = 0.0049), high serum Î±-fetoprotein levels (P<1x10-6), larger tumor size (P = 0.0031), high tumor grade P<1x10-6) and high tumor stage (P = 1.5x10-6). Patients with HCC tumors that expressed CA-IX were more likely to have lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS; P = 0.0001) and 5-year overall survival (OS; P<1x10-6). The multivariate analysis indicated that CA-IX expression was an independent predictor for high tumor stage (P = 0.0047) and DFS (P = 0.0456), and a borderline predictor for OS (P = 0.0762). Furthermore, CA-IX expression predicted poor DFS and OS in patients with high tumor stage (P = 0.0004 and P<1x10-6, respectively). Interestingly, CA-IX expression might contribute to the worse prognosis of female patients with advanced HCCs. Our study indicates the expression of the CA-IX protein is a crucial predictor of poor prognosis in resectable HCC, and it is also an unfavorable prognostic predictor in HCC patients with high tumor stage.


Title #142: Mapping Isoflavone QTL with Main, Epistatic and QTL Ã Environment Effects in Recombinant Inbred Lines of Soybean.

Abstract: Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) isoflavone is important for human health and plant defense system. To identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) and epistatic QTL underlying isoflavone content in soybean, F5:6, F5:7 and F5:8 populations of 130 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, derived from the cross of soybean cultivar 'Zhong Dou 27' (high isoflavone) and 'Jiu Nong 20' (low isoflavone), were analyzed with 95 new SSR markers. A new linkage map including 194 SSR markers and covering 2,312 cM with mean distance of about 12 cM between markers was constructed. Thirty four QTL for both individual and total seed isoflavone contents of soybean were identified. Six, seven, ten and eleven QTL were associated with daidzein (DZ), glycitein (GC), genistein (GT) and total isoflavone (TI), respectively. Of them 23 QTL were newly identified. The qTIF_1 between Satt423 and Satt569 shared the same marker Satt569 with qDZF_2, qGTF_1 and qTIF_2. The qGTD2_1 between Satt186 and Satt226 was detected in four environments and explained 3.41%-10.98% of the phenotypic variation. The qGTA2_1, overlapped with qGCA2_1 and detected in four environments, was close to the previously identified major QTL for GT, which were responsible for large a effects. QTL (qDZF_2, qGTF_1 and qTIF_2) between Satt144-Satt569 were either clustered or pleiotropic. The qGCM_1, qGTM_1 and qTIM_1 between Satt540-Sat_244 explained 2.02%-9.12% of the phenotypic variation over six environments. Moreover, the qGCE_1 overlapped with qGTE_1 and qTIE_1, the qTIH_2 overlapped with qGTH_1, qGCI_1 overlapped with qDZI_1, qTIL_1 overlapped with qGTL_1, and qTIO_1 overlapped with qGTO_1. In this study, some of unstable QTL were detected in different environments, which were due to weak expression of QTL, QTL by environment interaction in the opposite direction to a effects, and/or epistasis. The markers identified in multi-environments in this study could be applied in the selection of soybean cultivars for higher isoflavone content and in the map-based gene cloning.

Abstract: Periodic drug resistance surveillance provides useful information on trends of drug resistance and effectiveness of tuberculosis (TB) control measures. The present study determines the prevalence of drug resistance among new sputum smear positive (NSP) and previously treated (PT) pulmonary TB patients, diagnosed at public sector designated microscopy centers (DMCs) in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In this single-stage cluster-sampling prevalence survey, 70 of 700 DMCs were randomly selected using a probability-proportional to size method. A cluster size of 24 for NSP and a varying size of 0 to 99 for PT cases were fixed for each selected DMC. Culture and drug susceptibility testing was done on Lowenstein-Jensen medium using the economic variant of proportion sensitivity test for isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KAN). Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status was collected from patient records. From June 2011 to August 2012, 1524 NSP and 901 PT patients were enrolled. Any RMP resistance and any INH resistance were observed in 2.6% and 15.1%, and in 10.4% and 30% respectively in NSP and PT cases. Among PT patients, multi drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was highest in the treatment failure (35%) group, followed by relapse (13%) and treatment after default (10%) groups. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB) was seen in 4.3% of MDR-TB cases. Any OFX resistance was seen in 10.4% of NSP, 13.9% of PT and 29% of PT MDR-TB patients. The HIV status of the patient had no impact on drug resistance levels. RMP resistance was present in 2.6% of new and 15.1% of previously treated patients in Tamil Nadu. Rates of OFX resistance were high among NSP and PT patients, especially among those with MDR-TB, a matter of concern for development of new treatment regimens for TB.


Title #144: An Industry-Scale Mass Marking Technique for Tracing Farmed Fish Escapees.
PMID: 25738955
Authors: Fletcher F. Warren-Myers, Tim T. Dempster, Per Gunnar PG. Fjelldal, Tom T. Hansen, Stephen E SE. Swearer
Abstract: Farmed fish escape and enter the environment with subsequent effects on wild populations. Reducing escapes requires the ability to trace individuals back to the point of escape, so that escape causes can be identified and technical standards improved. Here, we tested if stable isotope otolith fingerprint marks delivered during routine vaccination could be an accurate, feasible and cost effective marking method, suitable for industrial-scale application. We tested seven stable isotopes, 134Ba, 135Ba, 136Ba, 137Ba, 86Sr, 87Sr and 26Mg, on farmed Atlantic salmon reared in freshwater, in experimental conditions designed to reflect commercial practice. Marking was 100% successful with individual Ba isotopes at concentrations as low as 0.001 Âµg. g-1 fish and for Sr isotopes at 1 Âµg. g-1 fish. Our results suggest that 63 unique fingerprint marks can be made at low cost using Ba (0.0002 - 0.02 $US per mark) and Sr (0.46 - 0.82 $US per mark) isotopes. Stable isotope fingerprinting during vaccination is feasible for commercial application if applied at a company level within the world's largest salmon producing nations. Introducing a mass marking scheme would enable tracing of escapees back to point of origin, which could drive greater compliance, better farm design and improved management practices to reduce escapes.

Abstract: HIV-related stigma undermines HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. Multipronged risk-reduction strategies may reduce stigma among African American adolescents. To test the effectiveness of a risk-reduction strategy in addressing stigma, 1613 African American adolescents from four mid-sized cities participated in a randomized control trial. Participants received a sexual-risk reduction [Focus on Youth (FOY)] or general health curriculum [Promoting Health Among Teens (PHAT)]. Two cities received a culturally-tailored media intervention. Participants completed baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month surveys to measure HIV-related stigma and knowledge. Analysis of covariance tested for stigma and knowledge differences by media city status and curriculum/media city status (PHAT media vs. PHAT non-media, FOY media vs. FOY non-media; FOY media vs. PHAT media; FOY non-media vs. PHAT non-media) at each measurement. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) determined stigma and knowledge differences over time. Media participants demonstrated greater HIV-related knowledge (p<0.10) at 6 months and lower stigma at 3 months (p<0.10). FOY media participants had lower 3-month (p<0.05) and 12-month (p<0.10) stigma scores than non-media FOY participants. FOY media and non-media participants had greater knowledge than PHAT for all intervals after baseline. FOY media had lower stigma than PHAT media after baseline for all intervals after baseline. HLM indicated greater knowledge slopes for the media group (p<0.05). FOY media participants had greater knowledge slopes (p<0.05) relative to non-media FOY participants and media PHAT participants (p<0.01). A combination of a HIV risk-reduction curriculum and culturally-tailored media demonstrated some effectiveness in reducing stigma. Future use of media in HIV-prevention should include and evaluate effects on stigma.


Title #147: Inhibitory effect of mammea E/BB from Mammea siamensis seed extract on Wilms' tumour 1 protein expression in a K562 leukaemic cell line.
PMID: 25738951

Abstract: Mammea siamensis is used in traditional Thai medicine. This study was designed to extract and isolate an active compound from the M. siamensis seeds and to investigate its activity on Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) protein expression in K562 cells. WT1 is a transcription factor that stimulates cell proliferation. The ethanol saraphi seed (ESS) extract was fractionated using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water to obtain n-hexane saraphi seed (HSS), ethyl acetate saraphi seed (EASS), n-butanol saraphi seed (BSS), and water saraphi seed (WSS) extracts, respectively. The ESS, HSS and EASS extracts had strong cytotoxic effects on K562 cells in the MTT assay. All three fractions decreased WT1 protein levels and decreased total cell numbers. The HSS extract decreased the WT1 protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. HPLC and NMR analyses indicated that the active compound of HSS was mammea E/BB. M. siamensis seeds are thus identified as a promising source of bioactive compounds for potential inhibition of WT1 protein expression.


Title #148: Australian academic primary health-care careers: a scoping survey.
PMID: 25738950
Authors: Christopher C. Barton, Joanne J. Reeve, Ann A. Adams, Ellen E. McIntyre
Abstract: This study was undertaken to provide a snapshot of the academic primary health-care workforce in Australia and to provide some insight into research capacity in academic primary health care following changes to funding for this sector. A convenience sample of individuals self-identifying as working within academic primary health care (n=405) completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents were identified from several academic primary health-care mailing lists. The survey explored workforce demographics, clarity of career pathways, career trajectories and enablers/barriers to 'getting in' and 'getting on'. A mix of early career (41%), mid-career (25%) and senior academics (35%) responded. Early career academics tended to be female and younger than mid-career and senior academics, who tended to be male and working in 'balanced' (teaching and research) roles and listing medicine as their disciplinary background. Almost three-quarters (74%) indicated career pathways were either 'completely' or 'somewhat unclear', irrespective of gender and disciplinary backgrounds. Just over half (51%) had a permanent position. Males were more likely to have permanent positions, as were those with a medical background. Less than half (43%) reported having a mentor, and of the 57% without a mentor, more than two-thirds (69%) would like one. These results suggest a lack of clarity in career paths, uncertainty in employment and a large number of temporary (contract) or casual positions represent barriers to sustainable careers in academic primary health care, especially for women who are from non-medicine backgrounds. Professional development or a mentoring program for primary health-care academics was desired and may address some of the issues identified by survey respondents.

Title #154: Metastasisâassociated in colon cancerâ1 is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, partly by promoting proliferation through enhanced glucose metabolism.
PMID: 25738944
Authors: Yaoqing Y. Li, Zhongtang Z. Lu, Zheyong Z. Liang, Dong D. Ji, Pengfei P. Zhang, Qingguang Q. Liu, Xin X. Zheng, Yingmin Y. Yao
Abstract: Metastasisâassociated in colon cancerâ1 (MACC1) is a newly identified gene that is involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however its investigation has not been comprehensive. In the present study, inÂ vitro techniques, including immunohistochemistry, western blotting, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, metabolic assay, MTT assay, colony formation assay and prognostic analysis were used to confirm the involvement of MACC1 in HCC. Histological examination confirmed that the protein expression of MACC1 was upregulated in HCC and was associated with the hexokinaseâ2 (HK2) protein, which also indicates a poor prognosis. Knockdown of MACC1 induced the reduction of glycogen consumption and lactate production, which then lead to a marked reduction of proliferation in the MHCCâ97H cells. However, the overexpression of MACC1 produced the opposite results in the HepG2 cells. These results suggested that MACC1 leads to a poor prognosis in HCC, partly by promoting proliferation via enhancement in glucose metabolism by HK2. Therefore, this pathway has the potential to become an important therapeutic target in HCC.


Title #155: Absence of Sex Differential Plasticity to Light Availability during Seed Maturation in Geranium sylvaticum.

Abstract: Sex-differential plasticity (SDP) hypothesis suggests that since hermaphrodites gain fitness through both pollen and seed production they may have evolved a higher degree of plasticity in their reproductive strategy compared to females which achieve fitness only through seed production. SDP may explain the difference in seed production observed between sexes in gynodioecious species in response to resource (nutrients or water) availability. In harsh environments, hermaphrodites decrease seed production whereas females keep it relatively similar regardless of the environmental conditions. Light availability can be also a limiting resource and thus could theoretically affect differently female and hermaphrodite seed output even though this ecological factor has been largely overlooked. We tested whether the two sexes in the gynodioecious species Geranium sylvaticum differ in their tolerance to light limitation during seed maturation in the field. We used a fully factorial block experiment exposing female and hermaphrodite plants to two different light environments (control and shade) after their peak flowering period. Specifically, we measured fruit and seed production in response to decreased light availability and compared it between the sexes. Shading reduced the number of fruits and seeds produced, but the decrease was similar between the sexes. Furthermore, shading delayed seed production by three days in both sexes, but did not affect seed mass, seed P content, or the probability of re-flowering the following year. Our results give no evidence for reproductive SDP in response to light during seed maturation.


Title #156: Indirect Short- and Long-Term Effects of Aboveground Invertebrate and Vertebrate Herbivores on Soil Microarthropod Communities.
PMID: 25738942

Abstract: Recognition is growing that besides ungulates, small vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores are important drivers of grassland functioning. Even though soil microarthropods play key roles in several soil processes, effects of herbivores-especially those of smaller body size-on their communities are not well understood. Therefore, we progressively excluded large, medium and small vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores for three growing seasons using size-selective fences in two vegetation types in subalpine grasslands; short-grass and tall-grass vegetation generated by high and low historical levels of ungulate grazing. Herbivore exclusions generally had few effects on microarthropod communities, but exclusion of all herbivore groups resulted in decreased total springtail and Poduromorpha richness compared with exclusion of only ungulates and medium-sized mammals, regardless of vegetation type. The tall-grass vegetation had a higher total springtail richness and mesostigmatid mite abundance than the short-grass vegetation and a different oribatid mite community composition. Although several biotic and abiotic variables differed between the exclusion treatments and vegetation types, effects on soil microarthropods were best explained by differences in nutrient and fibre content of the previous year's vegetation, a proxy for litter quality, and to a lesser extent soil temperature. After three growing seasons, smaller herbivores had a stronger impact on these functionally important soil microarthropod communities than large herbivores. Over longer time-scales, however, large grazers created two different vegetation types and thereby influenced microarthropod communities bottom-up, e.g. by altering resource quality. Hence, both short- and long-term consequences of herbivory affected the structure of the soil microarthropod community.

Abstract: Despite the important roles families play in the lives of many individuals with mental illness across cultures, there is a dearth of data worldwide on how family members perceive the process of cultural assessment as well as to how to best include them. This study addresses this gap in our knowledge through analysis of data collected across six countries as part of a DSM-5 Field Trial of the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI). At clinician discretion, individuals who accompanied patients to the clinic visit (i.e. patient companions) at the time the CFI was conducted were invited to participate in the cultural assessment and answer questions about their experience. The specific aims of this paper are (1) to describe patterns of participation of patient companions in the CFI across the six countries, and (2) to examine the comparative feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of the CFI from companion perspectives through analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Among the 321 patient interviews, only 86 (at four of 12 sites) included companions, all of whom were family members or other relatives. The utility, feasibility and acceptability of the CFI were rated favourably by relatives, supported by qualitative analyses of debriefing interviews. Cross-site differences in frequency of accompaniment merit further study.


Title #158: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) is associated with suppression of early carcinogenic events in human oral malignancies.
PMID: 25738940

Abstract: Inflammatory abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule that modulates the biological activity of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of IL1RN in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), and to determine its clinical significance. Expression levels of IL1RN in matched normal and tumor specimens from 39 OSCCs were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, and immunohistochemical analysis. Protein expression of IL1RN was also examined in 18 oral premalignant lesions (OPLs). Expression of IL1RN mRNA was significantly downregulated in OSCCs compared with normal tissues. Decreased expression of IL1RN protein was also observed in OPLs and OSCCs. The IL1RN expression level was lower in the OPL cases with severe dysplasia compared to those with mild/moderate dysplasia. Significantly downregulated IL1RN expression was observed in all OSCC lesion sites examined when compared with the matched normal tissues. However, the decreased level of IL1RN expression did not correspond with tumor progression. Noteworthy, IL1RN expression was higher in the advanced OSCC cases (T3/T4) compared to early cases (T1/T2). Among OSCC samples, relatively higher IL1RN expression was associated with active tumor development in the OSCCs occurring in the buccal mucosa, oral floor, fauces and gingiva, but not the tongue. These data suggest that IL1RN may exhibit opposing characteristics in oral malignancies depending on the stage of cancer development, suppressing early carcinogenic events, yet promoting tumor development in some lesion sites. Thus, IL1RN could represent a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis of OSCCs. Furthermore, IL1RN may possess unknown and complex functions in the developed OSCC.


Title #159: Involvement of CitCHX and CitDIC in Developmental-Related and Postharvest-Hot-Air Driven Citrate Degradation in Citrus Fruits.

Abstract: Citrate is the predominant organic acid associated with taste in citrus fruit. Although citrate metabolism has been widely studied in recent years, the potential contributions of transport proteins to citrate content remain unclear. In the present study, high-acid citrus fruit Gaocheng ('GC', Citrus sp.) and low-acid citrus fruit Satsuma mandarin ('SM', Citrus unshiu Marc.) were selected for study, and the degradation of citrate was deduced to be the main cause of the difference in acidity in fully mature fruits. RNA-seq analysis was carried out on 'GC' and 'SM' fruit samples over the same time course, and the results indicated that citrate degradation occurred mainly through the glutamine pathway, catalyzed by CitAco3-CitGS2-CitGDU1, and also two transport-related genes, CitCHX and CitDIC, were shown to be associated with citrate degradation. These results were confirmed by real-time PCR. In postharvest 'GC' fruit, the expressions of these two transport-related genes were induced by 2-fold under hot air treatment, accompanied by a reduction of 7%-9% in total acid degradation. Transient expression of CitCHX and CitDIC in tobacco leaves was performed, and the citrate content was reduced by 62%, 75% and 78% following CitCHX, CitDIC and CitCHX plus CitDIC treatments, respectively, as compared with expression of an empty vector. Overall, these data indicated that two transport proteins, CitCHX and CitDIC, are not only involved in citrate degradation during fruit development, but also involved in postharvest hot air triggered citrate reduction.


Title #160: Ear wax.
PMID: 25738938
Authors: Tony T. Wright
Abstract: Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented; for example, by the use of hearing aids, or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum, and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Abstract: RNA interference (RNAi) technology is currently being tested in clinical trials for a limited number of diseases. However, systemic delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to solid tumors has not yet been achieved in clinics. Here, we introduce an in vivo pH-sensitive delivery system for siRNA using super carbonate apatite (sCA) nanoparticles, which is the smallest class of nanocarrier. These carriers consist simply of inorganic ions and accumulate specifically in tumors, yet they cause no serious adverse events in mice and monkeys. Intravenously administered sCA-siRNA abundantly accumulated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells at 4 h, indicating quick achievement of endosomal escape. sCA-survivin-siRNA induced apoptosis in HT29 tumors and significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth of HCT116, to a greater extent than two other in vivo delivery reagents. With innovative in vivo delivery efficiency, sCA could be a useful nanoparticle for the therapy of solid tumors.


Title #162: N-Bromo-dimethylhydantoin-Polystyrene Resin for Water Microbial Decontamination.
PMID: 25738936
Authors: Oren O. Aviv, Shady S. Farah, Nir N. Amir, Natalia N. Laout, Stanislav S. Ratner, Abraham J AJ. Domb
Abstract: N-bromo dimethylhydantoin polystyrene beads were synthesized and tested as antimicrobial agent for water microbial decontamination. Optimization of synthetic process was thoroughly investigated, including: solvents used, ratio of reactants and reaction conditions, kilogram scale production and detailed spectral analysis. The microbial inactivation efficiency was studied according to NSF-231 Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. The tested resins maintained their activity for 550 liters. Thus, N-bromo-dimethyl hydantoin polystyrene beads synthesized under optimized conditions at Kg quantities have a potential use in water purification filters.

Title #164: H/D exchange in reactions of OH(-) with D2 and of OD(-) with H2 at low temperatures.
PMID: 25738934

Abstract: Using a cryogenic linear 22-pole rf ion trap, rate coefficients for H/D exchange reactions of OH(-) with D2 (1) and OD(-) with H2 (2) have been measured at temperatures between 11 K and 300 K with normal hydrogen. Below 60 K, we obtained k1 = 5.5 Ã 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) for the exoergic . Upon increasing the temperature above 60 K, the data decrease with a power law, k1(T) â¼ T(-2.7), reaching â1 Ã 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) at 200 K. This observation is tentatively explained with a decrease of the lifetime of the intermediate complex as well as with the assumption that scrambling of the three hydrogen atoms is restricted by the topology of the potential energy surface. The rate coefficient for the endoergic increases with temperature from 12 K up to 300 K, following the Arrhenius equation, k2 = 7.5 Ã 10(-11) exp(-92 K/T) cm(3) s(-1) over two orders of magnitude. The fitted activation energy, EA-Exp = 7.9 meV, is in perfect accordance with the endothermicity of 24.0 meV, if one accounts for the thermal population of the rotational states of both reactants. The low mean activation energy in comparison with the enthalpy change in the reaction is mainly due to the rotational energy of 14.7 meV contributed by ortho-H2 (J = 1). Nonetheless, one should not ignore the reactivity of pure para-H2 because, according to our model, it already reaches 43% of that of ortho-H2 at 100 K.


Title #165: Bromination of Olefins with HBr and DMSO.
PMID: 25738925
Authors: Megha M. Karki, Jakob J. Magolan
Abstract: A simple and inexpensive methodology is reported for the conversion of alkenes to 1,2-dibromo alkanes via oxidative bromination using HBr paired with dimethylsulfoxide which serves as the oxidant as well as co-solvent. The substrate scope includes 21 olefins brominated in good to excellent yields. Three of six styrene derivatives yielded bromohydrins under the reaction conditions.


Title #166: Normal Distribution of CD8+ T-Cell-Derived ELISPOT Counts within Replicates Justifies the Reliance on Parametric Statistics for Identifying Positive Responses.
PMID: 25738924
Authors: Alexey Y AY. Karulin, Richard R. Caspell, Marcus M. Dittrich, Paul V PV. Lehmann
Abstract: Accurate assessment of positive ELISPOT responses for low frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells is controversial. In particular, it is still unknown whether ELISPOT counts within replicate wells follow a theoretical distribution function, and thus whether high power parametric statistics can be used to discriminate between positive and negative wells. We studied experimental distributions of spot counts for up to 120 replicate wells of IFN-Î³ production by CD8+ T-cell responding to EBV LMP2A (426 - 434) peptide in human PBMC. The cells were tested in serial dilutions covering a wide range of average spot counts per condition, from just a few to hundreds of spots per well. Statistical analysis of the data using diagnostic Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test showed that in the entire dynamic range of ELISPOT spot counts within replicate wells followed a normal distribution. This result implies that the Student t-Test and ANOVA are suited to identify positive responses. We also show experimentally that borderline responses can be reliably detected by involving more replicate wells, plating higher numbers of PBMC, addition of IL-7, or a combination of these. Furthermore, we have experimentally verified that the number of replicates needed for detection of weak responses can be calculated using parametric statistics.


Title #167: Differential proteomic profiling of primary and recurrent chordomas.

Abstract: Chordomas are locally destructive tumors with high rates of recurrence and a poor prognosis. The mechanisms involved in chordoma recurrence remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the proteomic profile of a chordoma primary tumor (CSO) and a recurrent tumor (CSR) through mass spectrum in a chordoma patient who underwent surgery. Bioinformatic analysis of the profile showed that 359Â proteins had a significant expression difference and 21Â pathways had a striking alteration between the CSO and the CSR. The CSR showed a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed that the cancer stem cell marker activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM or CD166) expression level was higher in the recurrent than that in the primary tumor. The present study analyzed the proteomic profile change between CSO and CSR and identified a new biomarker ALCAM in recurrent chordomas. This finding sheds light on unraveling the pathophysiology of chordoma recurrence and on exploring more effective prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapies against this devastating disease.


Title #168: Martensitic transformation between competing phases in Ti-Ta alloys: a solid-state nudged elastic band study.
PMID: 25738922
Authors: Tanmoy T. Chakraborty, Jutta J. Rogal, Ralf R. Drautz
Abstract: A combined density functional theory and solid-state nudged elastic band study is presented to investigate the martensitic transformation between Î²Â âÂ (Î±â³, Ï) phases in the Ti-Ta system. The minimum energy paths along the transformation are calculated and the transformation mechanisms as well as relative stabilities of the different phases are discussed for various compositions. The analysis of the transformation paths is complemented by calculations of phonon spectra to determine the dynamical stability of the Î², Î±â³, and Ï phase. Our theoretical results confirm the experimental findings that with increasing Ta concentration there is a competition between the destabilisation of the Î±â³ and Ï phase and the stabilisation of the high-temperature Î² phase.
