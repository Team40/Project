Abstract: Understanding participants' preferences for the return of individual research results (IRR) in genomic research may allow for the implementation of more beneficial result disclosure methods. We tested four preference-setting models through cognitive interviews of parents to explore how parents conceptualize the process of setting preferences and which disease characteristics they believe to be most important when deciding what results to receive on their child. Severity and preventability of a condition were highly influential in decision making and certain groups of research results were anticipated by participants to have negative psychological effects. These findings informed the development of an educational tool and preference-setting model that can be scaled for use in the return of IRR from large biobank studies.

Abstract: Recently, there have been increasing numbers of activities labeled as either quality improvement (QI) or comparative effectiveness research (CER), both of which are designed to learn what works and what does not in routine clinical care settings. These activities can create confusion for researchers, Institutional Review Board members, and other stakeholders as they try to determine which activities or components of activities constitute clinical practices and which constitute clinical research requiring ethical oversight and informed consent. We conducted a series of semi-structured focus groups with QI and CER professionals to understand their experiences and views of the ethical and regulatory challenges that exist as well as the formal or informal practices and criteria they and their institutions use to address these issues. We found that most participants have experienced challenges related to the ethical oversight of QI and CER activities, and many believe that current regulatory criteria for distinguishing clinical practice from clinical research requiring ethical oversight are confusing. Instead, many participants described other criteria that they believe are more ethically appropriate. Many also described developing formal or informal practices at their institutions to navigate which activities require ethical oversight. However, these local solutions do not completely resolve the issues caused by the blurring of clinical practice and clinical research, raising the question of whether more foundational regulatory changes are needed.


Title #3: Analysis of Research Ethics Board Approval Times in an Academic Department of Medicine.
PMID: 25742673
Authors: Teresa S M TS. Tsang, Meaghan M. Jones, Graydon S GS. Meneilly
Abstract: As part of an ongoing effort to better understand barriers to academic research, we reviewed and analyzed the process of research ethics applications, focusing on ethics approval time, within the Department of Medicine from 2006 to 2011. A total of 1,268 applications for approval to use human subjects in research were included in our analysis. Three variables, risk category (minimal vs. non-minimal risk), type of funding, and year of submission, were statistically significant for prediction of ethics approval time, with risk status being the most important of these. The covariate-adjusted mean time for approval for minimal risk studies (35.7 days) was less than half that of non-minimal risk protocols (76.5 days). Studies funded through a for-profit sponsor had significantly longer approval times than those funded through other means but were also predominantly (87%) non-minimal risk protocols. Further investigations of the reasons underlying the observed differences are needed to determine whether improved training for research ethics board (REB) members and/or greater dialogue with investigators may reduce the lengthy approval times associated with non-minimal risk protocols.


Title #4: Measuring Voluntariness of Consent to Research: An Instrument Review.
PMID: 25742672
Authors: Nicole N. Mamotte, Douglas D. Wassenaar
Abstract: The conceptual complexity of the term voluntariness has resulted in relatively few empirical studies of the voluntariness component of consent to research. As the call for a formal assessment of voluntariness to be incorporated into the consent process intensifies, more researchers are responding to the challenge of developing a valid and reliable measure of voluntariness. The purpose of this article was to summarize and describe the empirical literature on voluntariness of consent. As part of a broader study on the voluntariness of consent to research, existing empirical studies of voluntariness of consent to research were reviewed to establish how voluntariness of consent to research has been assessed to date. Fifteen studies using different voluntariness assessment instruments were identified and included in the review. The review found that little attempt has been made to systematically collect data on the reliability and validity of voluntariness assessment instruments. No two instruments reviewed were found to be based on a shared conceptualization of voluntary consent to research.


Title #5: Parent Perspectives on Privacy and Governance for a Pediatric Repository of Non-Biological, Research Data.

Abstract: Research data repositories (RDRs) are data storage entities where data can be submitted, stored, and subsequently accessed for purposes beyond the original intent. There is little information relating to non-biological RDRs, nor considerations regarding pediatric data storage and re-use. We examined parent perspectives on pediatric, non-biological RDRs. Qualitative, descriptive methods including both interviews and focus groups were used. Purposive sampling of adult participants in two provincial birth cohorts yielded 19 interviewees and 18 focus group participants (4 groups). Transcripts were analyzed by thematic content analysis. Parent research participants strongly supported the sharing of their own, and their child's, non-biological research data. Four themes emerged: that altruism has limits, that participants have ongoing privacy concerns, that some participants need the assurance of congruent values between themselves and researchers/research questions, and that opinions diverge for some governance issues. The establishment of RDRs is important and maximizes participants', researchers', and funders' investments. Participants as data donors have concerns relating to privacy, relationships, and governance that must be considered in RDR development.


Title #6: Postpartum Women's Perspectives on the Donation of Placentas for Scientific Research in Campinas, Brazil.
PMID: 25742669
Authors: Rebecca Scott RS. Yoshizawa, Maria JosÃ© Duarte MJ. Osis, Simony Lira SL. Nascimento, Silvana Ferreira SF. Bento, Ana Carolina AC. Godoy, Suelene S. Coelho, JosÃ© Guilherme JG. Cecatti
Abstract: Little is known about public perspectives of scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas. Gaps in knowledge potentiate ethical and clinical problems regarding collection and applications. As such, this study sought to assess the perspectives of placenta donation of a sample of women. Postpartum women's perspectives on placental donation were assessed at the State University of Campinas in the Centro de AtenÃ§Ã¤o Integral a SaÃºde da Mulher (CAISM) maternity hospital using a cross-sectional survey (n = 384) and semi-structured interviews (n = 12). Surveys were analyzed quantitatively and interviews were analyzed qualitatively using grounded coding; results were compared. The average age of respondents was 27. Fifty-six percent had more than one child, 45% were Caucasian, 38% were mixed-race, 74% identified with a Christian faith, 52% had high school education or higher, 13% regarded the placenta as spiritually important, 72% felt that knowing what happens to the placenta after birth was somewhat or very important, 78% supported the use of the placenta in research and medicine, 59% reported that consent to collect the placenta was very or somewhat important, 78% preferred their doctor to invite donation, and only 7% preferred the researcher to invite donation. Interviews suggested women appreciate being part of research and that receiving information about studies was important to them. Informed by these results, we argue that women support scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas, want to be included in decision making, and desire information about the placenta. Placentas should not be viewed as "throwaway" organs that are poised for collection without the involvement and permission of women. Women want to be meaningfully included in research processes.


Title #7: Using "Clinical Trial Diaries" to Track Patterns of Participation for Serial Healthy Volunteers in U.S. Phase I Studies.
PMID: 25742668
Authors: Heather B HB. Edelblute, Jill A JA. Fisher
Abstract: Phase I testing of investigational drugs relies on healthy volunteers as research participants. Many U.S. healthy volunteers enroll repeatedly in clinical trials for the financial compensation. Serial participants are incentivized to ignore restrictions on their participation, and no centralized clinical trial registry prevents dual enrollment. Little is currently known about how healthy volunteers participate in studies over time, hampering the development of policies to protect this group. We detail a methodology developed as part of a longitudinal study to track in real-time healthy volunteers' Phase I participation. Illustrating these data through three case studies, we document how healthy volunteers use strategies, such as qualifying for studies at more than one clinic and traveling significant distances, to maximize their participation. Our findings suggest that "clinical trial diaries" can generate critical information about serial research participation and point to ethical issues unique to healthy volunteers' involvement in Phase I clinical trials.


Title #8: Motivational Factors for Participation in Biomedical Research: Evidence From a Qualitative Study of Biomedical Research Participation in Blantyre District, Malawi.
PMID: 25742667
Authors: Joseph J. Mfutso-Bengo, Lucinda L. Manda-Taylor, Francis F. Masiye
Abstract: Obtaining effective informed consent from research participants is a prerequisite to the conduct of an ethically sound research. Yet it is believed that obtaining quality informed consent is generally difficult in settings with low socioeconomic status. This is so because of the alleged undue inducements and therapeutic misconception among participants. However, there is a dearth of data on factors that motivate research participants to take part in research. Hence, this study was aimed at filling this gap in the Malawian context. We conducted 18 focus group discussions with community members in urban and rural communities of Blantyre in Malawi. Most participants reported that they accepted the invitation to participate in research because of better quality treatment during study also known as ancillary care, monetary and material incentives given to participants, and thorough medical diagnosis.


Title #9: Contrasting Views of Risk Perception and Influence of Financial Compensation Between Adolescent Research Participants and Their Parents.
PMID: 25742666
Authors: Lori L. Wiener, Adrienne A. Viola, Benjamin S BS. Wilfond, David D. Wendler, Christine C. Grady
Abstract: U.S. regulations governing pediatric research do not specify the assent process. To identify best practices, it is important to examine parents' and adolescents' views. The present study focuses on parents' and adolescents' views regarding possible research risks and the influence of financial compensation on their willingness to accept research procedures. Interviews were conducted with 177 adolescents participating in clinical research for a medical or psychiatric illness, or as healthy volunteers, and a parent. Significant discordance was found between how bothered the teen would feel from research-related side effects and procedures compared with parental report. Most teens were willing to accept non-beneficial procedures without compensation. Payment had significantly greater influence on healthy volunteers and their parents compared with those with a medical or psychiatric illness. Discordance between adolescent and parental views about risks recommends obtaining direct input from adolescents during the assent process. Modest payments should not raise concerns of undue inducement, especially in teens with pre-existing conditions.


Title #10: The MICHR Genomic DNA BioLibrary: An Empirical Study of the Ethics of Biorepository Development.
PMID: 25742665
Authors: Blake J BJ. Roessler, Nicholas H NH. Steneck, Lisa L. Connally
Abstract: In this article, we report on an effort to study the development and usefulness of a large, broad-use, opt-in biorepository for genomic research, focusing on three ethical issues: providing appropriate understanding, recruiting in ways that do not comprise autonomous decisions, and assessing costs versus benefits. We conclude the following: (a) Understanding can be improved by separating the task of informing subjects from documenting informed consent (Common Rule) and permission to use personal health information and samples for research (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]); however, regulations might have to be changed to accommodate this approach. (b) Changing recruiting methods increases efficiency but can interfere with subject autonomy. (c) Finally, we propose a framework for the objective evaluation of the utility of biorepositories and suggest that more attention needs to be paid to use and sustainability.


Title #11: An Analysis of Information Technology Adoption by IRBs of Large Academic Medical Centers in the United States.
PMID: 25742664
Authors: Shan S. He, Jeffrey R JR. Botkin, John F JF. Hurdle
Abstract: The clinical research landscape has changed dramatically in recent years in terms of both volume and complexity. This poses new challenges for Institutional Review Boards' (IRBs) review efficiency and quality, especially at large academic medical centers. This article discusses the technical facets of IRB modernization. We analyzed the information technology used by IRBs in large academic institutions across the United States. We found that large academic medical centers have a high electronic IRB adoption rate; however, the capabilities of electronic IRB systems vary greatly. We discuss potential use-cases of a fully exploited electronic IRB system that promise to streamline the clinical research work flow. The key to that approach utilizes a structured and standardized information model for the IRB application.


Title #12: Ethical Issues in Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and Comparative Effectiveness Research: A Pilot Study of Community Dialogue.
PMID: 25742663
Authors: Howard H. Brody, Sharon A SA. Croisant, Jerome W JW. Crowder, Jonathan P JP. Banda
Abstract: Community bioethics dialogues were held on the topic of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER). Participants were 65 and older and represented either a lower income, African American group (A) or a higher income White group (B). Participants were presented with a variety of background reading and study materials. Meetings were held 2 hr per week for 6 weeks. The groups showed both independence in judgment from the investigators and diversity of opinion between the two groups. Group B addressed more topics than Group A and in some instances explored additional policy nuances. Members of Group A appeared more cognizant of issues of social justice that affect vulnerable populations and appeared leery of approaches that suggested possible disrespect for their own personal experiences. Future plans call for both repeating the dialogue with additional, diverse community groups and repeating community bioethics dialogues on new topics with the same groups.


Title #13: Awareness of Federal Regulatory Mechanisms Relevant to Community-Engaged Research: Survey of Health Disparities-Oriented NIH-Funded Investigators.
PMID: 25742662
Authors: Stephanie M SM. Fullerton, Emily E EE. Anderson, Ketch K. Cowan, Rachel C RC. Malen, Doug D. Brugge
Abstract: Few studies or investigators involved in community-engaged research or community-based participatory research have examined awareness and adoption of federal regulatory mechanisms. We conducted a survey of investigators affiliated with the 10 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities. A questionnaire designed to capture experience with the conduct and oversight of community-engaged research, and awareness of pertinent regulatory mechanisms, including Federalwide Assurances (FWAs), Individual Investigator Agreements (IIAs), and Institutional Review Board Authorization Agreements (IAAs), was completed by 101 respondents (68% response rate). Although most were aware of FWAs, only a minority of those surveyed reported knowledge of IAAs and IIAs and even fewer had used them in their research with community partners. Implications for future training and oversight are discussed.


Title #14: Increasing Research Literacy: The Community Research Fellows Training Program.
PMID: 25742661
Authors: Jacquelyn V JV. Coats, Jewel D JD. Stafford, Vetta V. Sanders Thompson, Bethany B. Johnson Javois, Melody S MS. Goodman
Abstract: The Community Research Fellows Training (CRFT) Program promotes the role of underserved populations in research by enhancing the capacity for community-based participatory research (CBPR). CRFT consists of 12 didactic training sessions and 3 experiential workshops intended to train community members in research methods and evidence-based public health. The training (a) promotes partnerships between community members and academic researchers, (b) enhances community knowledge of public health research, and (c) trains community members to become critical consumers of research. Fifty community members participated in training sessions taught by multidisciplinary faculty. Forty-five (90%) participants completed the program. Findings demonstrate that the training increased awareness of health disparities, research knowledge, and the capacity to use CBPR as a tool to address disparities.


Title #15: Rapid Detection and Immune Characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus Infection in Cystic Fibrosis Patients.
PMID: 25742660

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis patients are highly susceptible to infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Especially Mycobacterium abscessus infections are common but reliable diagnosis is hampered by non-specific clinical symptoms and insensitive mycobacterial culture. In the present study we established novel methods for rapid detection and immune characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in cystic fibrosis patients. We performed Mycobacterium abscessus specific DNA-strip- and quantitative PCR-based analyses of non-cultured sputum samples to detect and characterize Mycobacterium abscessus infections. Concomitantly in vitro T-cell reactivation with purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from different mycobacterial species was used to determine Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cell cytokine expression of infected cystic fibrosis patients. Four of 35 cystic fibrosis patients (11.4%) were Mycobacterium abscessus culture positive and showed concordant DNA-strip-test results. Quantitative PCR revealed marked differences of mycobacterial burden between cystic fibrosis patients and during disease course. Tandem-repeat analysis classified distinct Mycobacterium abscessus strains of infected cystic fibrosis patients and excluded patient-to-patient transmission. Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cells were detected in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients with confirmed chronic infection and a subgroup of patients without evidence of Mycobacterium abscessus infection. Comparison of cytokine expression and phenotypic markers revealed increased proportions of CD40L positive T-cells that lack Interleukin-2 expression as a marker for chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Direct sputum examination enabled rapid diagnosis and quantification of Mycobacterium abscessus in cystic fibrosis patients. T-cell in vitro reactivation and cytokine expression analyses may contribute to diagnosis of chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infection.


Title #16: Outer Membrane Protein U (OmpU) Mediates Adhesion of Vibrio mimicus to Host Cells via Two Novel N-Terminal Motifs.
PMID: 25742659
Authors: Xueqin X. Liu, Huihui H. Gao, Nin N. Xiao, Yan Y. Liu, Jinnian J. Li, Lin L. Li
Abstract: Vibrio mimicus (V.mimicus) is a causative agent of ascites disease in aquatic animals. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the outer membrane protein U (OmpU) from V.mimicus is an immunoprotective antigen with six immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes. Although the N-terminus of OmpU contains potential binding motifs, it remained unclear whether OmpU possesses adhesion function. Here, the adhesive capacity of recombinant OmpU and V.mimicus to epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells was determined by immunofluorescence and adherence assay. The results showed that after co-incubated with rOmpU, an obvious visible green fluorescence could be observed on the EPC cell surface and the nuclei exhibited blue fluorescence; while the control cell surface did not show any signal, only nuclei exhibited blue fluorescence. The average number of wild-type strain adhered to each cell was 32.3 Â± 4.5. The average adhesion number of OmpU gene deletion mutant was significantly reduced to 10.8 Â± 0.5 (P < 0.01) and restored to 31.3 Â± 2.8 by complement strain (P >0.05). Pretreatment of cells with rOmpU reduced the average adhesion number of wild-type strain to 9.7 Â± 2.9 (P < 0.01). Likewise, binding was significantly decreased to 8.8 Â± 3.2 (P < 0.01) due to blocking role of OmpU antibodies. To determine binding motifs of OmpU, six immunodominant B-cell epitope peptides labeled with FITC were employed in flow cytometry-based binding assay. Two FITC-labeled epitope peptides (aa90-101 and aa173-192) showed strong binding to EPC cells (the fluorescence positive cell rate was 99 Â± 0.6% and 98 Â± 0.3%, respectively), which could be specifically competed by excess corresponding unlabeled peptides, whereas the remaining four showed a low level of background binding. This is the first demonstration that OmpU possesses adhesion function and its N terminal 90-101 and 173-192 amino acid regions are critical sites for cell surface binding.


Title #17: Development of a High-Throughput Resequencing Array for the Detection of Pathogenic Mutations in Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
PMID: 25742658
Authors: Yao Y. Wang, Yazhou Y. Cui, Xiaoyan X. Zhou, Jinxiang J. Han
Abstract: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inherited skeletal disease, characterized by bone fragility and low bone density. The mutations in this disorder have been widely reported to be on various exonal hotspots of the candidate genes, including COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, LEPRE1, and FKBP10, thus creating a great demand for precise genetic tests. However, large genome sizes make the process daunting and the analyses, inefficient and expensive. Therefore, we aimed at developing a fast, accurate, efficient, and cheaper sequencing platform for OI diagnosis; and to this end, use of an advanced array-based technique was proposed.

Title #20: Quantification of Cellular NEMO Content and Its Impact on NF-ÎºB Activation by Genotoxic Stress.

Abstract: NF-ÎºB essential modulator, NEMO, plays a key role in canonical NF-ÎºB signaling induced by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines and genotoxic agents. To dissect the different biochemical and functional roles of NEMO in NF-ÎºB signaling, various mutant forms of NEMO have been previously analyzed. However, transient or stable overexpression of wild-type NEMO can significantly inhibit NF-ÎºB activation, thereby confounding the analysis of NEMO mutant phenotypes. What levels of NEMO overexpression lead to such an artifact and what levels are tolerated with no significant impact on NEMO function in NF-ÎºB activation are currently unknown. Here we purified full-length recombinant human NEMO protein and used it as a standard to quantify the average number of NEMO molecules per cell in a 1.3E2 NEMO-deficient murine pre-B cell clone stably reconstituted with full-length human NEMO (C5). We determined that the C5 cell clone has an average of 4 x 105 molecules of NEMO per cell. Stable reconstitution of 1.3E2 cells with different numbers of NEMO molecules per cell has demonstrated that a 10-fold range of NEMO expression (0.6-6x105 molecules per cell) yields statistically equivalent NF-ÎºB activation in response to the DNA damaging agent etoposide. Using the C5 cell line, we also quantified the number of NEMO molecules per cell in several commonly employed human cell lines. These results establish baseline numbers of endogenous NEMO per cell and highlight surprisingly normal functionality of NEMO in the DNA damage pathway over a wide range of expression levels that can provide a guideline for future NEMO reconstitution studies.


Title #21: An Ex Vivo Model for Anti-Angiogenic Drug Testing on Intact Microvascular Networks.

Abstract: New models of angiogenesis that mimic the complexity of real microvascular networks are needed. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that cultured rat mesentery tissues contain viable microvascular networks and could be used to probe pericyte-endothelial cell interactions. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the rat mesentery culture model for anti-angiogenic drug testing by time-lapse quantification of network growth. Mesenteric windows were harvested from adult rats, secured in place with an insert, and cultured for 3 days according to 3 experimental groups: 1) 10% serum (angiogenesis control), 2) 10% serum + sunitinib (SU11248), and 3) 10% serum + bevacizumab. Labeling with FITC conjugated BSI-lectin on Day 0 and 3 identified endothelial cells along blood and lymphatic microvascular networks. Comparison between day 0 (before) and 3 (after) in networks stimulated by 10% serum demonstrated a dramatic increase in vascular density and capillary sprouting. Growing networks contained proliferating endothelial cells and NG2+ vascular pericytes. Media supplementation with sunitinib (SU11248) or bevacizumab both inhibited the network angiogenic responses. The comparison of the same networks before and after treatment enabled the identification of tissue specific responses. Our results establish, for the first time, the ability to evaluate an anti-angiogenic drug based on time-lapse imaging on an intact microvascular network in an ex vivo scenario.

Title #24: Binding of Subdomains 1/2 of PfEMP1-DBL1Î± to Heparan Sulfate or Heparin Mediates Plasmodium falciparum Rosetting.
PMID: 25742651
Authors: Davide D. Angeletti, Tatyana T. Sandalova, Mats M. Wahlgren, Adnane A. Achour
Abstract: The capacity of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) to adhere to the endothelial lining in the microvasculature and to red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the virulence of the parasite, the pathogenesis and development of severe malaria. Rosetting, the binding of uninfected RBC to pRBC, is frequently observed in individuals with severe malaria and is mediated by the N-terminal NTS-DBL1Î± domain of the adhesin Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed at the surface of the pRBC. Heparan sulfate has been suggested to be an important receptor for the NTS-DBL1Î± variant IT4var60 expressed by the parasite FCR3S1.2. Here, we have determined the binding site of NTS-DBL1Î± (IT4var60) to the RBC and heparin using a set of recombinant, mutated proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli. All the variants were studied for their ability to bind to RBC, their capacities to disrupt FCR3S1.2 rosettes, their affinities for heparin and their binding to rosette-disruptive mAbs. Our results suggest that NTS-DBL1Î± mediates binding to RBC through a limited number of basic amino acid residues localized on the surface of subdomains 1 (SD1) and 2 (SD2). The SD2-binding site is localized in close proximity to one of two previously identified binding sites in the rosetting PfEMP1 of the parasite PaloAlto-varO. The binding site in SD2 of NTS-DBL1Î± could represent a template for the development of anti-rosetting drugs.

Title #27: 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-Pyridyl)-1-Butanone Promotes Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Growth via Beta-Adrenoceptors In Vitro and In Vivo.
PMID: 25742648

Abstract: Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It contains several carcinogens known to initiate and promote tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is one of the strongest carcinogens in tobacco and our previous studies have shown its proliferation-promoting role in the progression of ESCC. Recently, NNK was identified as an agonist for both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Thus, we hypothesized that the cancer-promoting effect of NNK was likely mediated through beta-adrenoceptors in ESCC. Therefore, we investigated the comprehensive role of NNK in ESCC in vitro and in vivo, and found that NNK promoted many oncogenic features including ESCC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth as well as ESCC cell migration and invasion. Western blotting showed that NNK induced significant up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as down-regulation of Bax. Importantly, the oncogenic effects of NNK in ESCC and the altered protein expression were reversed to some extent by down-regulation of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with the beta2-adrenoceptor showing a greater rescue effect. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that NNK plays an oncogenic role in ESCC through beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, beta2-adrenoceptor might play a more important role in this process. Our findings might provide a chemoprevention and therapy strategy for cigarette smoke-related ESCC carcinogenesis.


Title #28: Transcriptomic Responses of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) to Environmental Enrichment during Juvenile Rearing.
PMID: 25742646
Authors: Melissa L ML. Evans, Tiago S TS. Hori, Matthew L ML. Rise, Ian A IA. Fleming
Abstract: Captive rearing programs (hatcheries) are often used in conservation and management efforts for at-risk salmonid fish populations. However, hatcheries typically rear juveniles in environments that contrast starkly with natural conditions, which may lead to phenotypic and/or genetic changes that adversely affect the performance of juveniles upon their release to the wild. Environmental enrichment has been proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficacy of population restoration efforts from captive-rearing programs; in this study, we examine the influence of environmental enrichment during embryo and yolk-sac larval rearing on the transcriptome of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Full siblings were reared in either a hatchery environment devoid of structure or an environment enriched with gravel substrate. At the end of endogenous feeding by juveniles, we examined patterns of gene transcript abundance in head tissues using the cGRASP-designed Agilent 4Ã44K microarray. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) indicated that 808 genes were differentially transcribed between the rearing environments and a total of 184 gene ontological (GO) terms were over- or under-represented in this gene list, several associated with mitosis/cell cycle and muscle and heart development. There were also pronounced differences among families in the degree of transcriptional response to rearing environment enrichment, suggesting that gene-by-environment effects, possibly related to parental origin, could influence the efficacy of enrichment interventions.


Title #29: Replicative DNA Polymerase Î´ but Not Îµ Proofreads Errors in Cis and in Trans.
PMID: 25742645

Abstract: It is now well established that in yeast, and likely most eukaryotic organisms, initial DNA replication of the leading strand is by DNA polymerase Îµ and of the lagging strand by DNA polymerase Î´. However, the role of Pol Î´ in replication of the leading strand is uncertain. In this work, we use a reporter system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure mutation rates at specific base pairs in order to determine the effect of heterozygous or homozygous proofreading-defective mutants of either Pol Îµ or Pol Î´ in diploid strains. We find that wild-type Pol Îµ molecules cannot proofread errors created by proofreading-defective Pol Îµ molecules, whereas Pol Î´ can not only proofread errors created by proofreading-defective Pol Î´ molecules, but can also proofread errors created by Pol Îµ-defective molecules. These results suggest that any interruption in DNA synthesis on the leading strand is likely to result in completion by Pol Î´ and also explain the higher mutation rates observed in Pol Î´-proofreading mutants compared to Pol Îµ-proofreading defective mutants. For strains reverting via ATâGC, TAâGC, CGâAT, and GCâAT mutations, we find in addition a strong effect of gene orientation on mutation rate in proofreading-defective strains and demonstrate that much of this orientation dependence is due to differential efficiencies of mispair elongation. We also find that a 3'-terminal 8 oxoG, unlike a 3'-terminal G, is efficiently extended opposite an A and is not subject to proofreading. Proofreading mutations have been shown to result in tumor formation in both mice and humans; the results presented here can help explain the properties exhibited by those proofreading mutants.


Title #30: The Nitric Oxide Production in the Moss Physcomitrella patens Is Mediated by Nitrate Reductase.

Abstract: During the last 20 years multiple roles of the nitric oxide gas (â¢NO) have been uncovered in plant growth, development and many physiological processes. In seed plants the enzymatic synthesis of â¢NO is mediated by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity performed by a still unknown enzyme(s) and nitrate reductase (NR). In green algae the â¢NO production has been linked only to NR activity, although a NOS gene was reported for Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus, no other Viridiplantae species has such gene. As there is no information about â¢NO synthesis neither for non-vascular plants nor for non-seed vascular plants, the interesting question regarding the evolution of the enzymatic â¢NO production systems during land plant natural history remains open. To address this issue the endogenous â¢NO production by protonema was demonstrated using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). The â¢NO signal was almost eliminated in plants treated with sodium tungstate, which also reduced the NR activity, demonstrating that in P. patens NR activity is the main source for â¢NO production. The analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed endogenous NO production and showed that â¢NO signal is accumulated in the cytoplasm of protonema cells. The results presented here show for the first time the â¢NO production in a non-vascular plant and demonstrate that the NR-dependent enzymatic synthesis of â¢NO is common for embryophytes and green algae.


Title #31: A Comparison of Near- and Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Methods for the Analysis of Several Nutritionally Important Chemical Substances in the Chinese Yam (Dioscorea opposita): Total Sugar, Polysaccharides, and Flavonoids.
PMID: 25742643
Authors: Hua H. Zhuang, Yongnian Y. Ni, Serge S. Kokot
Abstract: The Chinese yam (Dioscorea opposita) is a basic food in Asia and especially China. Consequently, an uncomplicated, reliable method should be available for the analysis of the quality and origin of the yams. Thus, near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopic methods were developed to discriminate among Chinese yam samples collected from four geographical regions. The yam samples were analyzed also for total sugar, polysaccharides, and flavonoids. These three analytes were used to compare the performance of the analytical methods. Overlapping spectra were resolved using chemometrics methods. Such spectra were compared qualitatively using principal component analysis (PCA) and quantitatively using partial least squares (PLS) and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. We discriminated among the four sets of yam data using PCA, and the NIR data performed somewhat better than the mid-IR data. We constructed the PLS and LS-SVM calibration models for the prediction of the three key variables, and the LS-SVM model produced better results. Also, the NIR prediction model produced better outcomes than the mid-IR prediction model. Thus, both infrared (IR) techniques performed well for the analysis of the three key analytes, and the samples were qualitatively discriminated according to their provinces of origin. Both techniques may be recommended for the analysis of Chinese yams, although the NIR technique would be preferred.


Title #32: Combined Treatment with Troglitazone and Lovastatin Inhibited Epidermal Growth Factor-Induced Migration through the Downregulation of Cysteine-Rich Protein 61 in Human Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Cells.
PMID: 25742642
Authors: Li-Han LH. Chin, Sung-Po SP. Hsu, Wen-Bin WB. Zhong, Yu-Chih YC. Liang
Abstract: Our previous studies have demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) can induce cell migration through the induction of cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) in human anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the inhibitory effects of combined treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³) ligand troglitazone and the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin at clinically achievable concentrations on ATC cell migration. Combined treatment with 5 Î¼M troglitazone and 1 Î¼M lovastatin exhibited no cytotoxicity but significantly inhibited EGF-induced migration, as determined using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. Cotreatment with troglitazone and lovastatin altered the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) -related marker gene expression of the cells; specifically, E-cadherin expression increased and vimentin expression decreased. In addition, cotreatment reduced the number of filopodia, which are believed to be involved in migration, and significantly inhibited EGF-induced Cyr61 mRNA and protein expression as well as Cyr61 secretion. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of 2 crucial signal molecules for EGF-induced Cyr61 expression, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), were decreased in cells cotreated with troglitazone and lovastatin. Performing a transient transfection assay revealed that the combined treatment significantly suppressed Cyr61 promoter activity. These results suggest that combined treatment with low doses of troglitazone and lovastatin effectively inhibits ATC cell migration and may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic ATC.


Title #33: The Tail Domain Is Essential but the Head Domain Dispensable for C. elegans Intermediate Filament IFA-2 Function.
PMID: 25742641
Authors: Kyle K. Williams, Kristen K. Williams, Hallie M HM. Baucher, John J. Plenefisch
Abstract: The intermediate filament protein IFA-2 is essential for the structural integrity of the Caenorhabditis elegans epidermis. It is one of the major components of the fibrous organelle, an epidermal structure comprised of apical and basal hemidesmosomes linked by cytoplasmic intermediate filaments that serve to transmit force from the muscle to the cuticle. Mutations of IFA-2 result in epidermal fragility and separation of the apical and basal epidermal surfaces during postembryonic growth. An IFA-2 lacking the head domain fully rescues the IFA-2 null mutant, whereas an IFA-2 lacking the tail domain cannot. Conversely, an isolated IFA-2 head was able to localize to fibrous organelles whereas the tail was not. Taken together these results suggest that the head domain contains redundant signals for IF localization, whereas non-redundant essential functions map to the IFA-2, tail, although the tail is unlikely to be directly involved in fibrous organelle localization.


Title #34: Probabilistic MRI Tractography of the Optic Radiation Using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution: A Feasibility Study.
PMID: 25742640

Abstract: Imaging the optic radiation (OR) is of considerable interest in studying diseases affecting the visual pathway and for pre-surgical planning of temporal lobe resections. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical feasibility of using probabilistic diffusion tractography based on constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to image the optic radiation. It was hypothesized that CSD would provide improved tracking of the OR compared with the widely used ball-and-stick model.


Title #35: Manipulation of a quasi-natural cell block for high-efficiency transplantation of adherent somatic cells.
PMID: 25742639
Authors: H J HJ. Chung, M M MM. Hassan, J O JO. Park, H J HJ. Kim, S T ST. Hong
Abstract: Recent advances have raised hope that transplantation of adherent somatic cells could provide dramatic new therapies for various diseases. However, current methods for transplanting adherent somatic cells are not efficient enough for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a novel method to generate quasi-natural cell blocks for high-efficiency transplantation of adherent somatic cells. The blocks were created by providing a unique environment in which cultured cells generated their own extracellular matrix. Initially, stromal cells isolated from mice were expanded in vitro in liquid cell culture medium followed by transferring the cells into a hydrogel shell. After incubation for 1 day with mechanical agitation, the encapsulated cell mass was perforated with a thin needle and then incubated for an additional 6 days to form a quasi-natural cell block. Allograft transplantation of the cell block into C57BL/6 mice resulted in perfect adaptation of the allograft and complete integration into the tissue of the recipient. This method could be widely applied for repairing damaged cells or tissues, stem cell transplantation, ex vivo gene therapy, or plastic surgery.


Title #36: Abundant immunohistochemical expression of dopamine D2 receptor and p53 protein in meningiomas: follow-up, relation to gender, age, tumor grade, and recurrence.
PMID: 25742638

Abstract: Meningiomas are common, usually benign tumors, with a high postoperative recurrence rate. However, the genesis and development of these tumors remain controversial. We aimed to investigate the presence and implications of a mutated p53 protein and dopamine D2 receptor in a representative series of meningiomas and to correlate these findings with age, gender, tumor grade, and recurrence. Tumor tissue samples of 157 patients diagnosed with meningioma (37 males and 120 females, mean age 53.6Â±14.3 years) who underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2012 at our institution were immunohistochemically evaluated for the presence of p53 protein and dopamine D2 receptor and were followed-up to analyze tumor recurrence or regrowth. Tumors were classified as grades I (n=141, 89.8%), II (n=13, 8.3%), or grade III (n=3, 1.9%). Dopamine D2 receptor and p53 protein expression were positive in 93.6% and 49.7% of the cases, respectively. Neither of the markers showed significant expression differences among different tumor grades or recurrence or regrowth statuses. Our findings highlight the potential role of p53 protein in meningioma development and/or progression. The high positivity of dopamine D2 receptor observed in this study warrants further investigation of the therapeutic potential of dopamine agonists in the evolution of meningiomas.


Title #37: Alternative chromatographic system for the quality control of lipophilic technetium-99m radiopharmaceuticals such as [99mTc(MIBI)6]+
PMID: 25742637
Authors: D P DP. Faria, C A CA. Buchpiguel, F L N FL. Marques
Abstract: Knowledge of the radiochemical purity of radiopharmaceuticals is mandatory and can be evaluated by several methods and techniques. Planar chromatography is the technique normally employed in nuclear medicine since it is simple, rapid and usually of low cost. There is no standard system for the chromatographic technique, but price, separation efficiency and short time for execution must be considered. We have studied an alternative system using common chromatographic stationary phase and alcohol or alcohol:chloroform mixtures as the mobile phase, using the lipophilic radiopharmaceutical [99mTc(MIBI)6]+ as a model. Whatman 1 modified phase paper and absolute ethanol, Whatman 1 paper and methanol:chloroform (25:75), Whatman 3MM paper and ethanol:chloroform (25:75), and the more expensive ITLC-SG and 1-propanol:chloroform (10:90) were suitable systems for the direct determination of radiochemical purity of [99mTc(MIBI)6]+ since impurities such as 99mTc-reduced-hydrolyzed (RH), 99mTcO4 - and [99mTc(cysteine)2]- complex were completely separated from the radiopharmaceutical, which moved toward the front of chromatographic systems while impurities were retained at the origin. The time required for analysis was 4 to 15 min, which is appropriate for nuclear medicine routines.


Title #38: Peroxiredoxin isoforms are associated with cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PMID: 25742636
Authors: E. E. El Eter, A A AA. Al-Masri
Abstract: The production of oxygen free radicals in type 2 diabetes mellitus contributes to the development of complications, especially the cardiovascular-related ones. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are antioxidant enzymes that combat oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the levels of PRDX isoforms (1, 2, 4, and 6) and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fifty-three patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (28F/25M) and 25 healthy control subjects (7F/18M) were enrolled. We measured the plasma levels of each PRDX isoform and analyzed their correlations with cardiovascular risk factors. The plasma PRDX1, -2, -4, and -6 levels were higher in the diabetic patients than in the healthy control subjects. PRDX2 and -6 levels were negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1c. In contrast, PRDX1 levels were positively correlated with low-density lipoprotein and C-reactive protein levels. PRDX4 levels were negatively correlated with triglycerides. In conclusion, PRDX1, -2, -4, and -6 showed differential correlations with a variety of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These results should encourage further research into the crosstalk between PRDX isoforms and cardiovascular risk factors.

Title #40: Kidney paired donation: a plea for a Swiss National Programme.

Abstract: Growing incidence of end-stage renal disease, shortage of kidneys from deceased donors and a better outcome for recipients of kidneys from living donor have led many centres worldwide to favour living donor kidney transplantation programmes. Although criteria for living donation have greatly evolved in recent years with acceptance of related and unrelated donors, an immunological incompatibility, either due to ABO incompatibility and/or to positive cross-match, between a living donor and the intended recipient, could impede up to 40% of such procedures. To avoid refusal of willing and healthy living donors, a number of strategies have emerged to overcome immunological incompatibilities. Kidney paired donation is the safest way for such patients to undergo kidney transplantation. Implemented with success in many countries either as national or multiple regional independent programmes, it could include simple exchanges between any number of incompatible pairs, incorporate compatible pairs and non-directed donors (NDDs) to start a chain of compatible transplantations, lead to acceptance of ABO-incompatible matching, and integrate desensitising protocols. Incorporating all variations of kidney paired donation, the Australian programme has been able to facilitate kidney transplantation in 49% of registered incompatible pairs. This review is a plea for implementing a national kidney paired donation programme in Switzerland.


Title #41: The Influence of Acute Pulmonary Hypertension on Cardiac Output Measurements: Calibrated Pulse Contour Analysis, Transpulmonary and Pulmonary Artery Thermodilution Against a Modified Fick Method in an Animal Model.
PMID: 25742632

Abstract: In critically ill patients with significant pulmonary hypertension (PH), close perioperative cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory, considering the increased morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Although the pulmonary artery catheter is still the standard for the diagnosis of PH, its use to monitor cardiac output (CO) in patients with PH is decreasing as a result of increased morbidity and possible influence of tricuspid regurgitation on the measurements. However, continuous CO measurement methods have never been evaluated under PH regarding their agreement and trending ability. In this study, we evaluated the influence of acute PH and different CO states on transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) and calibrated pulse contour analysis (PiCCO; both assessed with PiCCO plusâ¢), intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution (PATD), and continuous thermodilution (CCO) compared with a modified Fick method (FICK) in an animal model.

Title #43: Electrokinetic preconcentration of particles and cells in microfluidic reservoirs.

Abstract: Preconcentrating samples of dilute particles or cells to a detectable level is required in many chemical, environmental and biomedical applications. A variety of force fields have thus far been demonstrated to capture and accumulate particles and cells in microfluidic devices, which, however, all take place within the region of microchannels and may potentially cause channel clogging. This work presents a new method for the electrokinetic preconcentration of 1 Î¼m-diameter polystyrene particles and E. coli cells in a very-low-conductivity medium inside a microfluidic reservoir. The entire microchannel can hence be saved for a post-concentration analysis. This method exploits the strong recirculating flows of induced-charge electroosmosis to concentrate particles and cells near the corners of the reservoir-microchannel interface. Positive dielectrophoresis is found to also play a role when small microchannels are used at high electric fields. Such an in-reservoir electrokinetic preconcentration method can be easily implemented in a parallel mode to increase the flow throughput, which may potentially be used to preconcentrate bacterial pathogens in water.


Title #44: Stable Isotope Anatomy of Tropical Cyclone Ita, North-Eastern Australia, April 2014.
PMID: 25742628

Abstract: The isotope signatures registered in speleothems during tropical cyclones (TC) provides information about the frequency and intensity of past TCs but the precise relationship between isotopic composition and the meteorology of TCs remain uncertain. Here we present continuous Î´18O and Î´2H data in rainfall and water vapour, as well as in discrete rainfall samples, during the passage of TC Ita and relate the evolution in isotopic compositions to local and synoptic scale meteorological observations. High-resolution data revealed a close relationship between isotopic compositions and cyclonic features such as spiral rainbands, periods of stratiform rainfall and the arrival of subtropical and tropical air masses with changing oceanic and continental moisture sources. The isotopic compositions in discrete rainfall samples were remarkably constant along the ~450 km overland path of the cyclone when taking into account the direction and distance to the eye of the cyclone at each sampling time. Near simultaneous variations in Î´18O and Î´2H values in rainfall and vapour and a near-equilibrium rainfall-vapour isotope fractionation indicates strong isotopic exchange between rainfall and surface inflow of vapour during the approach of the cyclone. In contrast, after the passage of spiral rainbands close to the eye of the cyclone, different moisture sources for rainfall and vapour are reflected in diverging d-excess values. High-resolution isotope studies of modern TCs refine the interpretation of stable isotope signatures found in speleothems and other paleo archives and should aim to further investigate the influence of cyclone intensity and longevity on the isotopic composition of associated rainfall.

Title #46: Post-Amputation Pain Is Associated with the Recall of an Impaired Body Representation in Dreams-Results from a Nation-Wide Survey on Limb Amputees.

Abstract: The experience of post-amputation pain such as phantom limb pain (PLP) and residual limb pain (RLP), is a common consequence of limb amputation, and its presence has negative effects on a person's well-being. The continuity hypothesis of dreams suggests that the presence of such aversive experiences in the waking state should be reflected in dream content, with the recalled body representation reflecting a cognitive proxy of negative impact. In the present study, we epidemiologically assessed the presence of post-amputation pain and other amputation-related information as well as recalled body representation in dreams in a sample of 3,234 unilateral limb amputees. Data on the site and time of amputation, residual limb length, prosthesis use, lifetime prevalence of mental disorders, presence of post-amputation pain, and presence of non-painful phantom phenomena were included in logistic regression analyses using recalled body representation in dreams (impaired, intact, no memory) as dependent variable. The effects of age, sex, and frequency of dream recall were controlled for. About 22% of the subjects indicated that they were not able to remember their body representation in dreams, another 24% of the amputees recalled themselves as always intact, and only a minority of less than 3% recalled themselves as always impaired. Almost 35% of the amputees dreamed of themselves in a mixed fashion. We found that lower-limb amputation as well as the presence of PLP and RLP was positively associated with the recall of an impaired body representation in dreams. The presence of non-painful phantom phenomena, however, had no influence. These results complement previous findings and indicate complex interactions of physical body appearance and mental body representation, probably modulated by distress in the waking state. The findings are discussed against the background of alterations in cognitive processes after amputation and hypotheses suggesting an innate body model.


Title #47: Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Profiling Analysis of ZmPIN, ZmPILS, ZmLAX and ZmABCB Auxin Transporter Gene Families in Maize (Zea mays L.) under Various Abiotic Stresses.

Abstract: The auxin influx carriers auxin resistant 1/like aux 1 (AUX/LAX), efflux carriers pin-formed (PIN) (together with PIN-like proteins) and efflux/conditional P-glycoprotein (ABCB) are major protein families involved in auxin polar transport. However, how they function in responses to exogenous auxin and abiotic stresses in maize is largely unknown. In this work, the latest updated maize (Zea mays L.) reference genome sequence was used to characterize and analyze the ZmLAX, ZmPIN, ZmPILS and ZmABCB family genes from maize. The results showed that five ZmLAXs, fifteen ZmPINs, nine ZmPILSs and thirty-five ZmABCBs were mapped on all ten maize chromosomes. Highly diversified gene structures, nonconservative transmembrane helices and tissue-specific expression patterns suggested the possibility of function diversification for these genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression patterns of ZmLAX, ZmPIN, ZmPILS and ZmABCB genes under exogenous auxin and different environmental stresses. The expression levels of most ZmPIN, ZmPILS, ZmLAX and ZmABCB genes were induced in shoots and were reduced in roots by various abiotic stresses (drought, salt and cold stresses). The opposite expression response patterns indicated the dynamic auxin transport between shoots and roots under abiotic stresses. Analysis of the expression patterns of ZmPIN, ZmPILS, ZmLAX and ZmABCB genes under drought, salt and cold treatment may help us to understand the possible roles of maize auxin transporter genes in responses and tolerance to environmental stresses.


Title #48: Constitutively Active Signaling by the G Protein Î²Î³-Subunit Mediates Intrinsically Increased Phosphodiesterase-4 Activity in Human Asthmatic Airway Smooth Muscle Cells.
PMID: 25742624
Authors: Aihua A. Hu, Barry L BL. Diener, Maureen B MB. Josephson, Michael M MM. Grunstein
Abstract: Signaling by the GÎ²Î³ subunit of Gi protein, leading to downstream c-Src-induced activation of the Ras/c-Raf1/MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and its upregulation of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) activity, was recently shown to mediate the heightened contractility in proasthmatic sensitized isolated airway smooth muscle (ASM), as well as allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in an in vivo animal model of allergic asthma. This study investigated whether cultured human ASM (HASM) cells derived from asthmatic donor lungs exhibit constitutively increased PDE activity that is attributed to intrinsically upregulated GÎ²Î³ signaling coupled to c-Src activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 cascade. We show that, relative to normal cells, asthmatic HASM cells constitutively exhibit markedly increased intrinsic PDE4 activity coupled to heightened GÎ²Î³-regulated phosphorylation of c-Src and ERK1/2, and direct co-localization of the latter with the PDE4D isoform. These signaling events and their induction of heightened PDE activity are acutely suppressed by treating asthmatic HASM cells with a GÎ²Î³ inhibitor. Importantly, along with increased GÎ²Î³ activation, asthmatic HASM cells also exhibit constitutively increased direct binding of the small Rap1 GTPase-activating protein, Rap1GAP, to the Î±-subunit of Gi protein, which serves to cooperatively facilitate Ras activation and, thereby, enable enhanced GÎ²Î³-regulated ERK1/2-stimulated PDE activity. Collectively, these data are the first to identify that intrinsically increased signaling via the GÎ²Î³ subunit, facilitated by Rap1GAP recruitment to the Î±-subunit, mediates the constitutively increased PDE4 activity detected in asthmatic HASM cells. These new findings support the notion that interventions targeted at suppressing GÎ²Î³ signaling may lead to novel approaches to treat asthma.

Abstract: Several obesity related factors are reported to exacerbate premature arterial stiffening, including inactivity and metabolic disarray. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between physical activity, arterial stiffness and adiposity using objective methods. To further explore the role of adiposity in this complex process, obesity associated anthropometric and humoral biomarkers were measured.


Title #50: Partition and Poliomyelitis: An Investigation of the Polio Disparity Affecting Muslims during India's Eradication Program.
PMID: 25742622
Authors: Rashid S RS. Hussain, Stephen T ST. McGarvey, Lina M LM. Fruzzetti
Abstract: Significant disparities in the incidence of polio existed during its eradication campaign in India. In 2006, Muslims, who comprise 16% of the population in affected states, comprised 70% of paralytic polio cases. This disparity was initially blamed on the Muslims and a rumor that the vaccination program was a plot to sterilize their children. Using the framework of structural violence, this paper describes how the socio-political and historical context of Muslim populations in India shaped the polio disparity.

Title #52: Application of VEGFA and FGF-9 Enhances Angiogenesis, Osteogenesis and Bone Remodeling in Type 2 Diabetic Long Bone Regeneration.

Abstract: Although bone regeneration is typically a reliable process, type 2 diabetes is associated with impaired or delayed healing processes. In addition, angiogenesis, a crucial step in bone regeneration, is often altered in the diabetic state. In this study, different stages of bone regeneration were characterized in an unicortical bone defect model comparing transgenic type 2 diabetic (db-/db-) and wild type (WT) mice in vivo. We investigated angiogenesis, callus formation and bone remodeling at early, intermediate and late time points by means of histomorphometry as well as protein level analyses. In order to enhance bone regeneration, defects were locally treated with recombinant FGF-9 or VEGFA. Histomorphometry of aniline blue stained sections indicated that bone regeneration is significantly decreased in db-/db- as opposed to WT mice at intermediate (5 days post operation) and late stages (7 days post operation) of bone regeneration. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly decreased levels of RUNX-2, PCNA, Osteocalcin and PECAM-1 in db-/db- defects. In addition, osteoclastogenesis is impaired in db-/db- indicating altered bone remodeling. These results indicate significant impairments in angiogenesis and osteogenesis in type 2 diabetic bones. Importantly, angiogenesis, osteogenesis and bone remodeling could be reconstituted by application of recombinant FGF-9 and, in part, by VEGFA application. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that type 2 diabetes affects angiogenesis, osteogenesis and subsequently bone remodeling, which in turn leads to decreased bone regeneration. These effects could be reversed by local application of FGF-9 and to a lesser degree VEGFA. These data could serve as a basis for future therapeutic applications aiming at improving bone regeneration in the type 2 diabetic patient population.


Title #53: Schisandrin B Prevents Doxorubicin Induced Cardiac Dysfunction by Modulation of DNA Damage, Oxidative Stress and Inflammation through Inhibition of MAPK/p53 Signaling.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (Dox) is a highly effective antineoplastic drug. However, Dox-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes leads to irreversible degenerative cardiomyopathy, which limits Dox clinical application. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, has been shown to protect against oxidative damage in liver, heart and brain tissues in rodents. In current study, we investigated possible protective effects of Sch B against Dox-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. Mice received a single injection of Dox (20 mg/kg IP). Five days after Dox administration, left ventricular (LV) performance was significantly depressed and was improved by Sch B treatment. Sch B prevented the Dox-induced increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrotyrosine formation, and metalloproteinase activation in the heart. In addition, the increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-MAPK activated mitogen kinase 2 levels by Dox were significantly suppressed by Sch B treatment. Sch B also attenuated Dox-induced higher expression of LV proinflammatory cytokines, cardiomyocyte DNA damage, myocardial apoptosis, caspase-3 positive cells and phopho-p53 levels in mice. Moreover, LV expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and reactive oxygen species were significantly less in Sch B treatment mice after Dox injection. These findings suggest that Sch B attenuates Dox-induced cardiotoxicity via antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.

Abstract: Some studies have recently focused on the association between glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) null polymorphisms and hypertension; however, results have been inconsistent.


Title #55: Metagenome of a Microbial Community Inhabiting a Metal-Rich Tropical Stream Sediment.
PMID: 25742617

Abstract: Here, we describe the metagenome and functional composition of a microbial community in a historically metal-contaminated tropical freshwater stream sediment. The sediment was collected from the Mina Stream located in the Iron Quadrangle (Brazil), one of the world's largest mining regions. Environmental DNA was extracted and was sequenced using SOLiD technology, and a total of 7.9 Gbp was produced. A taxonomic profile that was obtained by comparison to the Greengenes database revealed a complex microbial community with a dominance of Proteobacteria and Parvarcheota. Contigs were recruited by bacterial and archaeal genomes, especially Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii and Nitrosopumilus maritimus, and their presence implicated them in the process of N cycling in the Mina Stream sediment (MSS). Functional reconstruction revealed a large, diverse set of genes for ammonium assimilation and ammonification. These processes have been implicated in the maintenance of the N cycle and the health of the sediment. SEED subsystems functional annotation unveiled a high degree of diversity of metal resistance genes, suggesting that the prokaryotic community is adapted to metal contamination. Furthermore, a high metabolic diversity was detected in the MSS, suggesting that the historical arsenic contamination is no longer affecting the prokaryotic community. These results expand the current knowledge of the microbial taxonomic and functional composition of tropical metal-contaminated freshwater sediments.

Abstract: Obesity is associated with poor asthma control, increased asthma morbidity, and decreased response to inhaled corticosteroids. We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with decreased bronchodilator responsiveness in children and adolescents with asthma. In addition, we hypothesized that subjects who were obese and bronchodilator unresponsive would have worse asthma control and require more asthma controller medications.


Title #60: Unpacking the 'structural' in a structural approach for HIV prevention among female sex workers: A case study from China.
PMID: 25742611
Authors: Yingying Y. Huang, Kathryn E KE. Muessig, Ning N. Zhang, Suzanne S. Maman
Abstract: Interventions for HIV prevention among female sex workers (FSWs) in China focus on HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) and individual behaviour change. An occupational health framework facilitates intervention across an array of health issues FSWs face including HIV/STI, violence, reproductive health, stigma and substance use. Through a case study of a community-based Jiaozhou (JZ) FSW programme, we developed a conceptual framework incorporating global discussions of structural approaches to HIV prevention with the specific social and structural contexts identified among FSWs in China. Based on ethnographic fieldwork between August 2010 and May 2013, we describe the evolution of this programme to its current occupational health focus and unpack the intervention strategies. We describe the critical features of the programme that have fostered success among FSWs including high-quality clinical services provided within a welcoming setting, responsive outreach work through staff and trained FSW peers, interpersonal and community-level engagement aimed at changing the local social and structural environments of sex work and tailored health education materials. This intervention differs from other projects in China by adopting a more holistic approach to FSW health that incorporates social issues. It also demonstrates the feasibility of structural interventions among FSWs even within an environment that has strong anti-prostitution policies.

This study aimed to examine insurance retention and utilization by children initially referred to insurance by our ED insurance linkage program.


Title #65: Induction of Excessive Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in the Drosophila Male Accessory Gland Results in Infertility.
PMID: 25742606
Authors: Clement Y CY. Chow, Frank W FW. Avila, Andrew G AG. Clark, Mariana F MF. Wolfner
Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER. A cell responds to ER stress with the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex program of transcriptional and translational changes aimed at clearing misfolded proteins. Secretory tissues and cells are particularly well adapted to respond to ER stress because their function requires high protein production and secretory load. The insect male accessory gland (AG) is a secretory tissue involved in male fertility. The AG secretes many seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) essential for male reproduction. Among adult Drosophila tissues, we find that genes upregulated by ER stress are most highly expressed in the AG, suggesting that the AG is already undergoing high levels of ER stress due to its normal secretory functions. We hypothesized that induction of excessive ER stress in the AG above basal levels, would perturb normal function and provide a genetic tool for studying AG and SFP biology. To test this, we genetically induced excessive ER stress in the AG by conditional 1) expression of a misfolded protein or 2) knockdown of the UPR regulatory protein, BiP. Both genetic manipulations induced excessive ER stress in the AG, as indicated by the increase in Xbp1 splicing, a marker of ER stress. Both models resulted in a large decrease in or loss of SFP production and male infertility. Sperm production, motility, and transfer appeared unaffected. The induction of strong ER stress in the insect male AG may provide a simple way for studying or manipulating male fertility, as it eliminates AG function while preserving sperm production.


Title #66: Auxin regulates SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphology restricting cell size.
PMID: 25742605
Authors: Christian C. LÃ¶fke, Kai K. DÃ¼nser, David D. Scheuring, JÃ¼rgen J. Kleine-Vehn
Abstract: The control of cellular growth is central to multicellular patterning. In plants, the encapsulating cell wall literally binds neighbouring cells to each other and limits cellular sliding/migration. In contrast to its developmental importance, growth regulation is poorly understood in plants. Here we reveal that the phytohormone auxin impacts on the shape of the biggest plant organelle, the vacuole. TIR1/AFBs-dependent auxin signalling posttranslationally controls the protein abundance of vacuolar SNARE components. Genetic and pharmacological interference with the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs interrelates with auxin-resistant vacuolar morphogenesis and cell size regulation. Vacuolar SNARE VTI11 is strictly required for auxin-reliant vacuolar morphogenesis and loss of function renders cells largely insensitive to auxin-dependent growth inhibition. Our data suggests that the adaptation of SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphogenesis allows auxin to limit cellular expansion, contributing to root organ growth rates.


Title #67: The prenyltransferase UBIAD1 is the target of geranylgeraniol in degradation of HMG CoA reductase.
PMID: 25742604
Authors: Marc M MM. Schumacher, Rania R. Elsabrouty, Joachim J. Seemann, Youngah Y. Jo, Russell A RA. DeBose-Boyd
Abstract: Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder in humans characterized by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in the cornea. SCD-associated mutations have been identified in the gene encoding UBIAD1, a prenyltransferase that synthesizes vitamin K2. Here, we show that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase, which is subject to sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation augmented by the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol through an unknown mechanism. Geranylgeraniol inhibits binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, allowing its degradation and promoting transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase degradation. SCD-associated mutations in UBIAD1 block its displacement from reductase in the presence of geranylgeraniol, thereby preventing degradation of reductase. The current results identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in reductase degradation, the inhibition of which may contribute to accumulation of cholesterol in SCD.


Title #68: Death following traumatic brain injury in Drosophila is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Unfavorable TBI outcomes result from primary mechanical injuries to the brain and ensuing secondary non-mechanical injuries that are not limited to the brain. Our Genome-wide Association study of Drosophila melanogaster revealed that the probability of death following TBI is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in tissue barrier function and glucose homeostasis. We found that TBI causes intestinal and blood-brain barrier dysfunction and that intestinal barrier dysfunction is highly correlated with the probability of death. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of glucose after a primary injury increases the probability of death through a secondary injury mechanism that exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction. Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is due in part to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Authors: Yuri Y. Gori, Ron R. Wehrens, Nicola N. La Porta, Federica F. Camin
Abstract: Tracking timber is necessary in order to prevent illegal logging and protect local timber production, but there is as yet no suitable analytical traceability method. Stable isotope ratios in plants are known to reflect geographical variations. In this study we analysed four stable isotope ratios in order to develop a model able to identify the geographic origin of Norway spruce in the European Alps.

Abstract: China is considered a country of low HIV prevalence (780,000 people living with HIV), however, HIV infections among high-risk populations continue to grow at alarming rates. Voluntary Counseling and Testing services were first implemented in 2003, and oral rapid HIV testing (ORHT) began in 2012. Dentists, as oral health experts, would be well placed to conduct ORHT. We assessed willingness of dentists to undertake ORHT in their clinical practice.


Title #72: Function through Synthesis-Informed Design.
PMID: 25742599
Authors: Paul A PA. Wender, Ryan V RV. Quiroz, Matthew C MC. Stevens
Abstract: Conspectus In 1996, a snapshot of the field of synthesis was provided by many of its thought leaders in a Chemical Reviews thematic issue on "Frontiers in Organic Synthesis". This Accounts of Chemical Research thematic issue on "Synthesis, Design, and Molecular Function" is intended to provide further perspective now from well into the 21st century. Much has happened in the past few decades. The targets, methods, strategies, reagents, procedures, goals, funding, practices, and practitioners of synthesis have changed, some in dramatic ways as documented in impressive contributions to this issue. However, a constant for most synthesis studies continues to be the goal of achieving function with synthetic economy. Whether in the form of new catalysts, reagents, therapeutic leads, diagnostics, drug delivery systems, imaging agents, sensors, materials, energy generation and storage systems, bioremediation strategies, or molecules that challenge old theories or test new ones, the function of a target has been and continues to be a major and compelling justification for its synthesis. While the targets of synthesis have historically been heavily represented by natural products, increasingly design, often inspired by natural structures, is providing a new source of target structures exhibiting new or natural functions and new or natural synthetic challenges. Complementing isolation and screening approaches to new target identification, design enables one to create targets de novo with an emphasis on sought-after function and synthetic innovation with step-economy. Design provides choice. It allows one to determine how close a synthesis will come to the ideal synthesis and how close a structure will come to the ideal function. In this Account, we address studies in our laboratory on function-oriented synthesis (FOS), a strategy to achieve function by design and with synthetic economy. By starting with function rather than structure, FOS places an initial emphasis on target design, thereby harnessing the power of chemists and computers to create new structures with desired functions that could be prepared in a simple, safe, economical, and green, if not ideal, fashion. Reported herein are examples of FOS associated with (a) molecular recognition, leading to the first designed phorbol-inspired protein kinase C regulatory ligands, the first designed bryostatin analogs, the newest bryologs, and a new family of designed kinase inhibitors, (b) target modification, leading to highly simplified but functionally competent photonucleases-molecules that cleave DNA upon photoactivation, (c) drug delivery, leading to cell penetrating molecular transporters, molecules that ferry other attached or complexed molecules across biological barriers, and (d) new reactivity-regenerating reagents in the form of functional equivalents of butatrienes, reagents that allow for back-to-back three-component cycloaddition reactions, thus achieving structural complexity and value with step-economy. While retrosynthetic analysis seeks to identify the best way to make a target, retrofunction analysis seeks to identify the best targets to make. In essence, form (structure) follows function.


Title #73: Molecular responses of Frankia sp. strain QA3 to naphthalene.
PMID: 25742598
Authors: Ethan E. Baker, Yang Y. Tang, Feixia F. Chu, Louis S LS. Tisa
Abstract: The Frankia-actinorhizal plant symbiosis plays a significant role in plant colonization in soils contaminated with heavy metals and toxic aromatic hydrocarbons. The molecular response of Frankia upon exposure to soil contaminants is not well understood. To address this issue, we subjected Frankia sp. strain QA3 to naphthalene stress and showed that it could grow on naphthalene as a sole carbon source. Bioinformatic analysis of the Frankia QA3 genome identified a potential operon for aromatic compound degradation as well as several ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. Under naphthalene stress, the expression of these genes was upregulated. Proteome analysis showed a differential protein profile for cells under naphthalene stress. Several protein spots were analyzed and used to identify proteins involved in stress response, metabolism, and energy production, including a lignostilbene dioxygenase. These results provide a model for understanding the molecular response of Frankia to common soil pollutants, which may be required for survival and proliferation of the bacterium and their hosts in polluted environments.


Title #74: Surgical treatment of type I Chiari malformation: the role of Magendie's foramen opening e tonsils manipulation.
PMID: 25742596
Authors: Claudio Henrique Fernandes CH. Vidal
Abstract: The treatment for type 1 Chiari malformation (CM 1) is one of the most controversial topics in the neurosurgical field. The present study evaluated two of the most applied surgical techniques to treat CM 1. Method 32 patients were evaluated and divided in two groups: group 1 had 16 patients that were submitted to decompression of occipital bone and dura mater of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ); group 2 also had 16 patients and in addition to the previous procedure, they were submitted to Magendie's foramen opening e tonsils manipulation. The comparison between the groups included neurological exam and cerebrospinal fluid flow imaging during pre and postoperative periods. Results Both techniques were equivalents in terms of neurological improvement of the patients (p > 0.05), but the group 2 had more surgical complications, with relative risk of 2.45 (CI 1.55-3.86) for adverse events. Whatever the cerebrospinal fluid flow at CVJ, the patients of the group 1 achieved greater amount of flow than the group 2 (p < 0.05) during the postoperative period. Conclusion The cranial and dural decompression of the CVJ without arachnoidal violation was the best surgical intervention for treatment of CM 1, between these two compared techniques.


Title #75: Neurology at Escola Paulista de Medicina (1933-1995). From Fausto Guerner to JosÃ© Geraldo Camargo Lima.
PMID: 25742589
Authors: Henrique Ballalai HB. Ferraz, Afonso Carlos AC. Neves
Abstract: Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM) was founded in 1933 and the first Professor of Neurology was Fausto Guerner, who could not effectively assume the teaching activities due to his premature death in 1938. Professor Guerner had had his neurological training at Paris. Professor Longo was his successor. Longo was one of the founders of Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria the foremost journal of neurosciences in Latin American. Longo died in 1967 and Professor Paulo Pupo succeeded him. Pupo introduced electroencephalography in Brazil. After his death in 1970, Professor Dante Giorgi succeeded him until 1974. Professor JosÃ© Geraldo Camargo Lima took over the position after Giorgi's death. He created the Neurological Emergency unit, initiated the Post-Graduation in Neurology and divided the Discipline in specialized units. During the 1980's and until his retirement in 1995, EPM had become one of most important centers of Brazil training neurologists and researchers in neurological sciences.

PMID: 25742588
Authors: Eduardo E. Wilson
Abstract: Aloysio de Castro, when Director of the School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro, and AmÃ©rico Ricaldoni, when Dean of the School of Medicine of Montevideo, Uruguay, started a period of intense collaboration between both institutions. In this period, Aloysio visited Montevideo in many occasions, giving lectures, donating scientific material and publishing papers in Uruguay. Ricaldoni retributed his visits, distinguishing Aloysio as the first foreign Honorary Professor of the Medical School of Uruguay, participating in the inauguration of the new building of the School in Rio. Even after Ricaldoni's death in 1928, for many years, Aloysio continued with his visits. A poem by Aloysio de Castro dedicated to Montevideo is attached.


Title #77: Alzheimer's 100th anniversary of death and his contribution to a better understanding of Senile dementia.
PMID: 25742587
Authors: Eliasz E. Engelhardt, Marleide da Mota MD. Gomes
Abstract: Initially the trajectory of the historical forerunners and conceptions of senile dementia are briefly presented, being highlighted the name of Alois Alzheimer who provided clinical and neuropathological indicators to differentiate a group of patients with Senile dementia. Alzheimer's examination of Auguste D's case, studied by him with Bielschowsky's silver impregnation technique, permitted to identify a pathological marker, the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, characterizing a new disease later named after him by Kraepelin - Alzheimer's disease. Over the time this disorder became one of the most important degenerative dementing disease, reaching nowadays a status that may be considered as epidemic.


Title #78: Andreas Vesalius as a renaissance innovative neuroanatomist: his 5th centenary of birth.
PMID: 25742586
Authors: Marleide da Mota MD. Gomes, Mauricio M. Moscovici, Eliasz E. Engelhardt
Abstract: Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) is considered the Father of Modern Anatomy, and an authentic representative of the Renaissance. His studies, founded on dissection of human bodies, differed from Galeno, who based his work on dissection of animals, constituted a notable scientific advance. Putting together science and art, Vesalius associated himself to artists of the Renaissance, and valued the images of the human body in his superb work De Humani Corporis Fabrica.This paper aims to honor this extraordinary European Renaissance physician and anatomist, who used aesthetic appeal to bind text and illustration, science and art. His achievements are highlighted, with an especial attention on neuroanatomy. Aspects about his personal life and career are also focused.


Title #79: Sleep deprivation, pain and prematurity: a review study.
PMID: 25742585
Authors: Kelly Cristina Santos de Carvalho KC. Bonan, JoÃ£o da Costa JD. Pimentel Filho, Rosana Maria RM. TristÃ£o, JosÃ© Alfredo Lacerda de JA. Jesus, DioclÃ©cio D. Campos Junior
Abstract: The aim was to describe current reports in the scientific literature on sleep in the intensive care environment and sleep deprivation associated with painful experiences in premature infant. A systematic search was conducted for studies on sleep, pain, premature birth and care of the newborn. Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, VHL and SciELO databases were consulted. The association between sleep deprivation and pain generates effects that are observed in the brain and the behavioral and physiological activity of preterm infants. Polysomnography in intensive care units and pain management in neonates allow comparison with the first year of life and term infants. We have found few references and evidence that neonatal care programs can influence sleep development and reduce the negative impact of the environment. This evidence is discussed from the perspective of how hospital intervention can improve the development of premature infants.


Title #80: Neurological examination: pioneering authors and their books.
PMID: 25742584
Authors: PÃ©ricles P. MaranhÃ£o-Filho, Maurice Borges MB. Vincent, Marcos Martins da MM. Silva
Abstract: The objective of this article is to highlight some of the most important pioneering books specifically focused on the neurological examination and their authors. During the XIX Century, Alexander Hammond, William Gowers and Charles Mills pioneered the neurological literature, followed in the XX Century by Aloysio de Castro, Monrad-Krohn, Derek Denny-Brown, Robert Wartenberg, Gordon Holmes, and Russel DeJong. With determination and a marked sense of observation and research, they competently developed and spread the technique and art of the neurological exam.


Title #81: Tamoxifen antagonizes the effects of ovarian hormones to induce anxiety and depression-like behavior in rats.
PMID: 25742583
Authors: Hamid H. Azizi-Malekabadi, Masoume M. Pourganji, Hoda H. Zabihi, Mohsen M. Saeedjalali, Mahmoud M. Hosseini
Abstract: The effects of tamoxifen (TAM) on anxiety and depression-like behavior in ovariectomized (OVX) and naÃ¯ve female rats were investigated. The animals were divided into Sham-TAM, OVX-TAM, Sham and OVX groups. Tamoxifen (1 mg/kg) was administered for 4 weeks. In the forced swimming test, the immobility times in the OVX and Sham-TAM groups were higher than in the Sham group. In the open field, the numbers of central crossings in the OVX and Sham-TAM groups were lower than the number in the Sham group, and the number of peripheral crossings in the OVX group was lower than the number in the Sham group. In the elevated plus maze, the numbers of entries to the open arm among the animals in the Sham-TAM and OVX groups were lower than the number in the Sham group, while the number of entries to the open arm in the OVX-TAM group was higher than the number in the OVX group. It was shown that deletion of ovarian hormones induced anxiety and depression-like behavior. Administration of tamoxifen in naÃ¯ve rats led to anxiety and depression-like behavior that was comparable with the effects of ovarian hormone deletion. It can be suggested that tamoxifen antagonizes the effects of ovarian hormones. It also seems that tamoxifen has anxiolytic effects on ovariectomized rats.


Title #82: Effects of iodinated contrast media in a novel model for cerebral vasospasm.
PMID: 25742582
Authors: Tatiana T. Nikitina, Olga O. Zavaritskaya, Vladimir V. Semenyutin, Pontus B PB. Persson, Andreas A. Patzak, Mauricio M. Sendeski
Abstract: Objective We developed an in vitro model for vasospasm post subarachnoid hemorrhage that was suitable for investigating brain vessel autoregulation. We further investigated the effects of iodinated contrast medium on the vascular tone and the myogenic response of spastic cerebral vessels. Method We isolated and perfused the superior cerebellar arteries of rats. The vessels were pressurized and studied under isobaric conditions. Coagulated blood was used to simulate subarachnoid hemorrhage. The contrast medium iodixanol was applied intraluminally. Results Vessels exposed to blood developed significantly stronger myogenic tone (65.7 Â± 2.0% vs 77.1 Â± 1.2% of the maximum diameter, for the blood and the control group, respectively) and significantly decreased myogenic response, compared with the control groups. The contrast medium did not worsen the myogenic tone or the myogenic response in any group. Conclusion Our results show that deranged myogenic response may contribute to cerebral blood flow disturbances subsequent to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The contrast medium did not have any negative influence on vessel tone or myogenic response in this experimental setting.


Title #83: A Case-Control study of the prevalence of neurological diseases in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
PMID: 25742581
Authors: Francisco de Assis Aquino FA. Gondim, Gisele Ramos de GR. Oliveira, Benedito Cadorno V BC. Teles, Marcellus H L P MH. Souza, Lucia L B C LL. Braga, Erick L EL. Messias
Abstract: Neurological diseases are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, but their exact prevalence is unknown. Method We prospectively evaluated the presence of neurological disorders in 121 patients with IBD [51 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 70 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 50 controls (gastritis and dyspepsia) over 3 years. Results Our standard neurological evaluation (that included electrodiagnostic testing) revealed that CD patients were 7.4 times more likely to develop large-fiber neuropathy than controls (p = 0.045), 7.1 times more likely to develop any type of neuromuscular condition (p = 0.001) and 5.1 times more likely to develop autonomic complaints (p = 0.027). UC patients were 5 times more likely to develop large-fiber neuropathy (p = 0.027) and 3.1 times more likely to develop any type of neuromuscular condition (p = 0.015). Conclusion In summary, this is the first study to prospectively establish that both CD and UC patients are more prone to neuromuscular diseases than patients with gastritis and dyspepsia.


Title #84: Piribedil and Pathological Gambling in six Parkinsonian patients.
PMID: 25742580
Authors: Federico E FE. Micheli, Juan C JC. Giugni, Micke E De Arco ME. Espinosa, Daniela S DS. Calvo, Gabriela B GB. Raina
Abstract: Impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have attracted increasing interest. They are characterized by the inability to control the impulse to perform an act that can be detrimental to them or to others. Although dopamine agonists (DA), as a group, have been associated with impulse control disorders (ICD), piribedil has rarely been reported to cause them. Method Case reports of six parkinsonian patients on piribedil presenting pathological gambling (PG). Results All of the patients presented ICD associated with piribedil use. Two of them received this medication as first treatment and four of them who had developed ICDs secondary to other DA that reappeared with piribedil. Conclusion Despite piribedil is commercially available in only a few countries, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PG in patients with PD.


Title #85: Artificial gait in complete spinal cord injured subjects: how to assess clinical performance.
PMID: 25742579
Authors: Karla Rocha KR. Pithon, Daniela Cristina Carvalho de DC. Abreu, Renata R. Vasconcelos-Neto, Luiz Eduardo Barreto LE. Martins, Alberto A. Cliquet-Jr
Abstract: Objective Adapt the 6 minutes walking test (6MWT) to artificial gait in complete spinal cord injured (SCI) patients aided by neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Method Nine male individuals with paraplegia (AIS A) participated in this study. Lesion levels varied between T4 and T12 and time post injured from 4 to 13 years. Patients performed 6MWT 1 and 6MWT 2. They used neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and were aided by a walker. The differences between two 6MWT were assessed by using a paired t test. Multiple r-squared was also calculated. Results The 6MWT 1 and 6MWT 2 were not statistically different for heart rate, distance, mean speed and blood pressure. Multiple r-squared (r2 = 0.96) explained 96% of the variation in the distance walked. Conclusion The use of 6MWT in artificial gait towards assessing exercise walking capacity is reproducible and easy to apply. It can be used to assess SCI artificial gait clinical performance.

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effect of waiting time (WT) to radiotherapy (RT) on overall survival (OS) of glioblastoma (GBM) patients as a reliable prognostic variable in Brazil, a scenario of medical disparities. Method Retrospective study of 115 GBM patients from two different health-care institutions (one public and one private) in Brazil who underwent post-operative RT. Results Median WT to RT was 6 weeks (range, 1.3-17.6). The median OS for WT â¤ 6 weeks was 13.5 months (95%CI , 9.1-17.9) and for WT > 6 weeks was 14.2 months (95%CI, 11.2-17.2) (HR 1.165, 95%CI 0.770-1.762; p = 0.470). In the multivariate analysis, the variables associated with survival were KPS (p < 0.001), extent of resection (p = 0.009) and the adjuvant treatment (p = 0.001). The KPS interacted with WT to RT (HR 0.128, 95%CI 0.034-0.476; p = 0.002), showing that the benefit of KPS on OS depends on the WT to RT. Conclusion No prognostic impact of WT to RT could be detected on the OS. Although there are no data to ensure that delays to RT are tolerable, we may reassure patients that the time-length to initiate treatment does not seem to influence the control of the disease, particularly in face of other prognostic factors.

Abstract: Children with epilepsy present significant problems concerning attention and comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Objective To determine the prevalence of attention complaints, ADHD diagnosis and attention profile in a sample of children and adolescents with idiopathic epilepsy. Method 36 children and adolescents with idiopathic epilepsy and 37 genre and age matched healthy controls underwent several procedures to diagnose their neuropsychological profile and comorbidity with ADHD. Results The prevalence of ADHD was higher in patients with epilepsy [Ï2= 4.1, p = 0.043, 6 (16.7%) vs 1 (2.7%)], with worse results in attention related WISC items and factors in patients with epilepsy comparing to the controls, but not between patients with and without ADHD. Clinical characteristics did not influence those results. Conclusion This study found a greater prevalence of problems wih attention in pediatric patients with idiopathic epilepsy, but not a distinct profile between those with or without ADHD.

Abstract: Objective This study will evaluate how decreasing depression severity via group psychotherapy affects the cognitive function of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are also diagnosed with depression and cognitive dysfunction. Method MS patients completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The group members diagnosed with depression and cognitive dysfunction underwent group psychotherapy for 3 months. Upon completion of psychotherapy, both tests were readministered. Results Depression and cognitive dysfunction were comorbid in 15 (13.9%) of patients. Although improvement was detected at the end of the 3-month group psychotherapy intervention, it was limited to the BDI and the Paced Auditory Test. Conclusion Group psychotherapy might decrease cognitive impairment in MS patients.

PMID: 25742575
Authors: Telma Rocha de TR. Assis, Aroldo A. Bacellar, Gersonita G. Costa, Osvaldo J M OJ. Nascimento
Abstract: Epilepsy in the elderly has high incidence and prevalence and is often underecognized. Objective To describe etiological prevalence of epilepsy and epileptic seizures in elderly inpatients. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed on elderly patients who had epilepsy or epileptic seizures during hospitalization, from January 2009 to December 2010. One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled. They were divided into two age subgroups (median 75 years) with the purpose to compare etiologies. Results The most common etiology was ischemic stroke (36.7%), followed by neoplasias (13.3%), hemorrhagic stroke (11.7%), dementias (11.4%) and metabolic disturbances (5.5%). The analysis of etiological association showed that ischemic stroke was predominant in the younger subgroup (45% vs 30%), and dementias in the older one (18.9% vs 3.8%), but with no statistical significance (p = 0.23). Conclusion This study suggests that epilepsy and epileptic seizures in the elderly inpatients have etiological association with stroke, neoplasias and dementias.

Abstract: Objective Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) may present unstable pattern of seizures. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of relapse-remitting seizures in MTLE with (MTLE-HS) and without (MTLE-NL) hippocampal sclerosis. Method We evaluated 172 patients with MTLE-HS (122) or MTLE-NL (50). Relapse-remitting pattern was defined as periods longer than two years of seizure-freedom intercalated with seizure recurrence. "Infrequent seizures" was considered as up to three seizures per year and "frequent seizures" as any period of seizures higher than that. Results Thirty-seven (30%) MTLE-HS and 18 (36%) MTLE-NL patients had relapse-remitting pattern (X2, p = 0.470). This was more common in those with infrequent seizures (X2, p < 0.001). Twelve MTLE-HS and one MTLE-NL patients had prolonged seizure remission between the first and second decade of life (X2, p = 0.06). Conclusion Similar proportion of MTLE-HS or MTLE-NL patients present relapse-remitting seizures and this occurs more often in those with infrequent seizures.


Title #91: Removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions using waste iron columns inoculated with iron bacteria.
PMID: 25742571
Authors: Abooalfazl A. Azhdarpoor, Roya R. Nikmanesh, Mohammad Reza MR. Samaei
Abstract: Arsenic contamination of water resources is one of the serious risks threatening natural ecosystems and human health. This study investigates arsenic removal using waste iron column with and without iron bacteria in continuous and batch phases. In batch experiments, the effects of pH, contact time, initial concentration of arsenic and adsorbent dose were investigated. Results indicated that the highest arsenate removal efficiency occurred at pH 7 (96.76%). With increasing the amount of waste iron from 0.25 to 1 g, the removal rate changed from about 42.37% to 96.70%. The results of continuous experiments on the column containing waste iron showed that as the empty bed contact time (EBCT) increased from 5 to 60 min, the secondary arsenate concentration changed from 23 to 6 Âµg/l. In experiments involving waste iron column with iron bacteria, an increase in residence time from 5 to 60 minutes decreased the secondary arsenate concentration from 14.97 to 4.86 Âµg/l. The results of this study showed that wastes iron containing iron bacteria is a good adsorbent for removal of arsenic from contaminated water.


Title #92: Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons and Differentiated Adipose-derived Stem Cells: An In Vitro Co-culture Model to Study Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.
PMID: 25742570
Authors: Alba C AC. de Luca, Alessandro A. Faroni, Adam J AJ. Reid
Abstract: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, located in the intervertebral foramina of the spinal column, can be used to create an in vitro system facilitating the study of nerve regeneration and myelination. The glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells (SC), are key facilitators of these processes; it is therefore crucial that the interactions of these cellular components are studied together. Direct contact between DRG neurons and glial cells provides additional stimuli sensed by specific membrane receptors, further improving the neuronal response. SC release growth factors and proteins in the culture medium, which enhance neuron survival and stimulate neurite sprouting and extension. However, SC require long proliferation time to be used for tissue engineering applications and the sacrifice of an healthy nerve for their sourcing. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) differentiated into SC phenotype are a valid alternative to SC for the set-up of a co-culture model with DRG neurons to study nerve regeneration. The present work presents a detailed and reproducible step-by-step protocol to harvest both DRG neurons and ASC from adult rats; to differentiate ASC towards a SC phenotype; and combines the two cell types in a direct co-culture system to investigate the interplay between neurons and SC in the peripheral nervous system. This tool has great potential in the optimization of tissue-engineered constructs for peripheral nerve repair.

Abstract: Cocaine abuse remains a devastating medical problem for our society. Current concepts suggest that both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, particularly in young people, can result as a consequence of cocaine exposure. We provide an analysis of mechanisms of injury and a discussion of the pharmacological management of stroke following cocaine use. Preclinical research suggests that the cause of cocaine-mediated stroke is multifactorial and involves vasospasm, changes in cerebral vasculature, and platelet aggregation. We suggest that drugs able to induce vasospastic, thrombogenic, or neurotoxic effects of cocaine could be suitable as therapeutic agents. In contrast caution should be exerted when using anti-platelet and thrombolytic agents in cocaine users with stroke.


Title #95: Low Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate is Associated with High Recurrence Rate and Poor Prognosis of Hemorrhage Stroke.
PMID: 25742567
Authors: Sun S. Kai, Q U QU. Jiaoyan, Song S. Weihua, Zhang Z. Yinhui, Zhang Z. Channa, Song S. Li, Song S. Yan, Hui H. Rutai, Chen C. Jingzhou
Abstract: This study investigated whether a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) leads to a higher risk of stroke recurrence and a poor prognosis in hemorrhagic stroke patients. A total of 2000 stroke patients were recruited during 2000-2001 and prospectively followed up for a median of 4.5 years. The independent association of a low eGFR with stroke recurrence and poor prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. Among the hemorrhagic stroke patients, the incidence rate of a low eGFR for the compound endpoints (stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality) was greater than that of a normal eGFR (P=0.012). A similar result was observed for the incidence rate of recurrence and death caused by cardiovascular disease or stroke (Csdeath) (P=0.013, and P=0.001, respectively). After adjustment for age, sex, and other cardiovascular risk factors, a low eGFR was associated with a 2.93-fold increased risk of the compound endpoints (P=0.001, RR=2.93, 95% CI=1.58-5.43), 3.06-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke (P=0.003, RR=3.06, 95% CI=1.46-6.40), and 3.57-fold increased risk of Csdeath (P=0.005, RR=3.57, 95% CI=1.46-8.70) among hemorrhagic stroke patients. Among the hemorrhagic stroke patients, a low eGFR was a strong predictor of stroke recurrence and a poor prognosis.


Title #96: Programming Apoptosis and Autophagy with Novel Approaches for Diabetes Mellitus.
PMID: 25742566
Authors: Kenneth K. Maiese
Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, diabetes mellitus (DM) in the year 2030 will be ranked the seventh leading cause of death in the world. DM impacts all systems of the body with oxidant stress controlling cell fate through endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in uncoupling proteins, and the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Multiple treatment approaches are being entertained for DM with Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 (S. cerevisiae) (SIRT1) generating significant interest as target pathways that can address maintenance of glucose homeostasis as well as prevention of cellular pathology by controlling insulin resistance, stem cell proliferation, and the programmed cell death pathways of apoptosis and autophagy. WISP1, mTOR, and SIRT1 can rely upon similar pathways such as AMP activated protein kinase as well as govern cellular metabolism through cytokines such as EPO and oral hypoglycemics such as metformin. Yet, these pathways require precise biological control to exclude potentially detrimental clinical outcomes. Further elucidation of the ability to translate the roles of WISP1, mTOR, and SIRT1 into effective clinical avenues offers compelling prospects for new therapies against DM that can benefit hundreds of millions of individuals throughout the globe.

Title #98: Use of the Open Field Maze to Measure Locomotor and Anxiety-like Behavior in Mice.
PMID: 25742564
Authors: Michael L ML. Seibenhener, Michael C MC. Wooten
Abstract: Animal models have proven to be invaluable to researchers trying to answer questions regarding the mechanisms of behavior. The Open Field Maze is one of the most commonly used platforms to measure behaviors in animal models. It is a fast and relatively easy test that provides a variety of behavioral information ranging from general ambulatory ability to data regarding the emotionality of the subject animal. As it relates to rodent models, the procedure allows the study of different strains of mice or rats both laboratory bred and wild-captured. The technique also readily lends itself to the investigation of different pharmacological compounds for anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects. Here, a protocol for use of the open field maze to describe mouse behaviors is detailed and a simple analysis of general locomotor ability and anxiety-related emotional behaviors between two strains of C57BL/6 mice is performed. Briefly, using the described protocol we show Wild Type mice exhibited significantly less anxiety related behaviors than did age-matched Knock Out mice while both strains exhibited similar ambulatory ability.


Title #99: Evolution and Phenotypic Selection of Cancer Stem Cells.
PMID: 25742563
Authors: Jan J. Poleszczuk, Philip P. Hahnfeldt, Heiko H. Enderling
Abstract: Cells of different organs at different ages have an intrinsic set of kinetics that dictates their behavior. Transformation into cancer cells will inherit these kinetics that determine initial cell and tumor population progression dynamics. Subject to genetic mutation and epigenetic alterations, cancer cell kinetics can change, and favorable alterations that increase cellular fitness will manifest themselves and accelerate tumor progression. We set out to investigate the emerging intratumoral heterogeneity and to determine the evolutionary trajectories of the combination of cell-intrinsic kinetics that yield aggressive tumor growth. We develop a cellular automaton model that tracks the temporal evolution of the malignant subpopulation of so-called cancer stem cells(CSC), as these cells are exclusively able to initiate and sustain tumors. We explore orthogonal cell traits, including cell migration to facilitate invasion, spontaneous cell death due to genetic drift after accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations, symmetric cancer stem cell division that increases the cancer stem cell pool, and telomere length and erosion as a mitotic counter for inherited non-stem cancer cell proliferation potential. Our study suggests that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation potential yields larger populations of non-stem cancer cells(CC) that compete with CSC and thus inhibit CSC division while a reduction in proliferation potential loosens such inhibition and facilitates frequent CSC division. The sub-population of cancer stem cells in itself becomes highly heterogeneous dictating population level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. Our study suggests that the clonal diversity that is captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes.


Title #100: Bio-directed synthesis and nanostructural characterization of anisotropic gold nanoparticles.
PMID: 25742562
Authors: GermÃ¡n G. Plascencia-Villa, Daniel D. Torrente, Marcelo M. Marucho, Miguel M. JosÃ©-YacamÃ¡n
Abstract: Gold nanoparticles with anisotropic structures have tunable absorption properties and diverse bio-applications as image contrast agents, plasmonics and as therapeutic-diagnostic materials. Amino acids with electrostatically charged side chains possess inner affinity for metal ions. Lysine (Lys) efficiently controlled the growing into star-shape nanoparticles with controlled narrow sizes (30-100 nm) and produced in high yields (85-95%). Anisotropic nanostructures showed tunable absorbance from UV to NIR range, with extraordinary colloidal stability (-26 to -42 mV) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering properties. Advanced electron microscopy characterization through ultra-high resolution SEM, STEM and HR-TEM confirmed the size, nanostructure, crystalline structure and chemical composition. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that Lys interacted preferentially with Au(I) through the -COOH group instead of their positive side chains with a binding free energy (BFE) of 3.4 kcal mol-1. These highly monodisperse and colloidal stable anisotropic particles prepared with biocompatible compounds may be employed in biomedical applications.

PMID: 25742558
Authors: Kurt K. Schicho, Rudolf R. Seemann, Michael M. Binder, Michael M. Figl
Abstract: As the subcutaneous course of the hair follicle cannot be extrapolated from the angle of hair emergence, the follicular unit extraction (FUE) method bears the risk of follicle transsection potentially affecting the success of the whole intervention. Histological examination can provide this angle information but are too time consuming and invasive to be integrated in the workflow.

Abstract: Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a rare malignancy of the eccrine sweat glands that is locally aggressive with a high propensity to metastasize. Most cases have been treated by wide local excision (WLE) with 20% local recurrence rate. There have been 20 cases of EPC treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) in the literature.


Title #108: Bleeding and Thrombotic Events in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support: A Review of Literature.
PMID: 25742553
Authors: Mate M. Petricevic, Davor D. Milicic, Marko M. Boban, Martina Zrno MZ. Mihaljevic, Zeljko Z. Baricevic, Kresimir K. Kolic, Kresimir K. Dolic, Lucija L. Konosic, Tomislav T. Kopjar, Bojan B. Biocina
Abstract: Bleeding and thrombotic events are among the most common complications detected in patients with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Herein, we reviewed the available evidence on the prevalence, etiology, and management of bleeding and thrombotic events in patients following MCS procedures, such as implantation of both intra- and paracorporeal devices that generate either pulsatile or nonpulsatile flow. Extracorporeal life support procedures providing support to the failing heart and lungs were also reviewed. Most bleeding and thromboembolic events occur despite appropriate hemostatic and anticoagulation management based on conventional coagulation laboratory parameters. Prevalence of bleeding events in this population ranges between 5 and 81%. Wide range in prevalence of bleeding reported in literature may be explained by different devices with different anticoagulation protocols being used, as well as different definitions of bleeding outcomes. Although bleeding events are more common than thromboembolic events, the consequences of thrombotic events are often detrimental. Management of bleeding events remains challenging and measures to prevent and treat bleeding events are often followed by thromboembolic events. Therefore, a personalized approach based on point-of-care hemostatic tests and adjusted to device type and patient comorbidities is therefore warranted. To provide advanced understanding of hemostatic disturbances during MCS, prospective trials focused on bleeding and thromboembolic events as primary endpoints should be conducted. Better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and a shift towards a personalized approach based on functional point-of-care hemostatic properties assessment may provide more favorable clinical outcomes. This should, however, be coupled with further technological improvements providing better device surface hemocompatibility as interaction between blood and device surface affects the hemostatic equilibrium.


Title #109: Survival following Pulmonary Metastasectomy for Sarcoma.

Abstract: ObjectivesâThe aim of this study is to report the overall survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with metastatic sarcoma and prognostic factors for survival. MethodsâThis is a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients having pulmonary metastasectomy for sarcoma over a 5-year period. Survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. ResultsâBetween August 2007 and January 2014, a total of 80 pulmonary metastasectomies were performed on 66 patients with metastatic sarcoma. There were no postoperative in-hospital deaths. The median age was 51 years (range, 16-79) and 39 (59%) patients were male. Fourteen patients had bilateral lung operations and surgical access was by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 48 (73%) cases. The median number of metastases resected was 3 (range, 1-9). The median disease-free interval was 25 months (range, 0-156). Median overall survival was 25.5 months (range, 1-60). At follow-up, 19 patients (29%) were dead with a median follow-up of 31 months (range, 1-60). Recurrence of metastases significantly affected survival: median of 25.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.7-33.4) versus 48.4 months (95% CI, 42.5-54.4) in patients with no recurrent metastases (pâ=â0.004). There was no significant difference in survival between patients with high-grade versus low-grade tumors (pâ=â0.13), histological type (osteosarcoma vs. other soft tissue sarcoma types, pâ=â0.14), unilateral versus bilateral lung metastases (pâ=â0.48), or lung metastases alone versus lung and other sites of metastases (pâ=â0.5). ConclusionâIn selected patients, pulmonary metastasectomy for sarcoma is safe and may confer a good medium-term survival. Recurrent metastasis after resection confers a poor prognosis.


Title #110: Painful Chest Wall Swellings: Tietze Syndrome or Chest Wall Tumor?
PMID: 25742551
Authors: Tevfik T. Kaplan, Nesimi N. Gunal, Gultekin G. Gulbahar, Bulent B. Kocer, Serdar S. Han, Mehmet Ali MA. Eryazgan, Arzu A. Ozsoy, Seniha S. Naldoken, AslÄ±han A. Alhan, Unal U. Sakinci
Abstract: ObjectiveâTietze syndrome (TS) is an inflammatory condition characterized by chest pain and swelling of costochondral junction. Primary chest wall tumors may mimic TS. In this article, we report our experience of approximately 121 patients initially diagnosed as TS and determined chest wall tumor in some cases at the follow-up. MethodsâThis is a retrospective review of patients diagnosed as TS by clinical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, routine laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT) of chest: all treated and followed up between March 2001 and July 2012. There were 121 cases (41 males and 80 females; mean age, 39.6âÂ±â3.2 years) of TS. ResultsâIn 27 patients with initial normal radiological findings, the size of swellings had doubled during the follow-up period (mean, 8.51âÂ±â2.15 months). These patients were reevaluated with chest CT and bone scintigraphy and then early diagnostic biopsy was performed. Pathologic examination revealed primary chest wall tumor in 13 patients (5 malignant, 8 benign). CT had a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 64.2% in detection of tumors (kappa: 0.56, pâ=â0.002), whereas the sensitivity and the specificity of bone scan were 84.6 and 35.7%, respectively (kappa: 0.199, pâ=â0.385). ConclusionâPrimary chest wall tumors could mimic TS. Bone scintigraphy or CT is not specific enough to determine malignant and other benign disorders of costochondral junction. Therefore, clinicians should follow TS patients more closely, and in case of increasing size of swelling, early diagnostic biopsy should be considered.


Title #111: The Midterm Results of Radiofrequency Ablation and Vagal Denervation in the Surgical Treatment of Long-Standing Atrial Fibrillation Associated with Rheumatic Heart Disease.
PMID: 25742550

Abstract: BackgroundâThough maze III procedure is an effective surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), the complexity and complications prevent its widespread application. Radiofrequency ablation (RA) has become an accepted therapy, but its chronic effects are still unclear. This retrospective clinical study describes our experience of RA and vagal denervation (VD) in surgical treatment of long-standing AF associated with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) during a 5-year follow-up. MethodsâBetween June 2006 and December 2007, a total of 173 consecutive patients with long-standing AF-associated RHD underwent mitral valve replacement and ablation maze procedure. In total, 92 cases had RA alone and 81 had RAâ+âVD. Patients were followed up with clinical examination and electrocardiography, and the data were analyzed by multivariable analysis with Cox hazard model. ResultsâThe average follow-up time was 5.0âÂ±â0.6 years. Multivariable analysis with Cox hazard model revealed that the duration of AF, the size of the left atrium, and tricuspid regurgitation are risk factors for AF recurrence. In addition, long-standing AFââ¥â7 years, left atrium diameterââ¥â58âmm, and severe tricuspid regurgitation may increase the risk of AF recurrence by 2.16-, 2.37-, and 2.67-fold, respectively. Although the freedom from AF during 2 to 5 postoperative years in the RA and RAâ+âVD groups were similar, the percentage of antiarrhythmic drug therapy was higher in the RA group during the early postoperative period (4th month, 54.1 vs. 34.7%, pâ=â0.017; 5th month, 39.2 vs. 21.3%, pâ=â0.018; 6th month, 23.0 vs. 10.7%, pâ=â0.044). Furthermore, the percentage of those free from AF was lower during the 1st year (6th month, 82.2 vs 93.8%, pâ=â0.023; 1st year, 76.1 vs. 89.9%, pâ=â0.019). ConclusionâRA is effective for the surgical treatment of long-standing AF associated with rheumatic valve disease. Though vagal denervation helped to maintain a stable sinus rhythm at an early stage, there was no additional benefit after the 1st year of follow-up.


Title #112: Use of del Nido Cardioplegia in Adult Cardiac Surgery.
PMID: 25742549
Authors: Rajesh R. Ramanathan, Dan W DW. Parrish, Trygve K TK. Armour, Derek R DR. Brinster
Abstract: Backgroundâdel Nido cardioplegia was developed to protect pediatric hearts, and similar to pediatric hearts, older adult hearts tolerate ischemia-reperfusion poorly. This study investigates the feasibility of del Nido cardioplegia as an alternative to conventional Buckberg cardioplegia in adult cardiac surgery. MethodsâA total of 142 adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with del Nido cardioplegia and conventional Buckberg cardioplegia were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsâFewer doses of cardioplegia and fewer defibrillations were noted with del Nido cardioplegia, and there were no significant differences in incidence of postoperative events. Conclusionâdel Nido cardioplegia may be a feasible alternative to conventional Buckberg cardioplegia.

Abstract: BackgroundâTraditionally, patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are sedated and mechanically ventilated, which increases risk of complications related to immobility and mechanical ventilation. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and highlight the benefits of a bridge to lung transplant (LTx) using "awake ECMO" support. MethodsâThe peripheral venovenous or venoarterial ECMO was implanted at a bedside. A retrospective study of patients undergoing LTx between January 2007 and March 2013 was performed. Outcomes in patients supported on ECMO as a bridge to LTx and kept "awake" (Group 1) were compared with the rest of the LTx patients (Group 2). ResultsâIn this period, 249 LTx were performed and in them 7 patients were bridged to LTx using "awake ECMO" strategy. Two patients were awake at ECMO implantation and throughout the therapy, and two patients were on ventilator support at the time of ECMO implantation who were extubated later and maintained awake until LTx. The remaining three patients were awake for some time during the ECMO. There was no statistically significant difference in most donor characteristics and recipient baseline characteristics as well as post-LTx parameters between the two groups. One-year survival estimate was not different between the groups: Group 1, 85.7% vs. Group 2, 86.3% (log rank pâ=â0.99). ConclusionâIn end-stage lung disease, the ECMO can be commenced in "awake" patients and patients can be awakened on ECMO. The "awake ECMO" strategy may avoid complications related to mechanical ventilation, sedation, and immobilization and provide comparable outcomes in the high-risk LTx patients.

Abstract: BackgroundâMinimally invasive cardiac surgery via right lateral minithoracotomy is a well-described approach. However, reports on isolated tricuspid valve surgery (TVS) in this technique are rare. Therefore, we like to give a contribution by reporting our experience. MethodsâWe retrospectively reviewed 25 tricuspid valve operations via right lateral minithoracotomy with femoral cannulation between August 2009 and September 2013 (18 repairs, 7 replacements, and 72% repair rate). Three patients (12%) presented for a re-do operation, and nine patients (36%) suffered from active endocarditis at admission. All patients underwent TVS as single valve procedure. Ten patients received additional procedures such as removal of infected leads, resection of atrial tumors, or closure of atrial septal defects. An annuloplasty ring was inserted in 12 cases. We investigated the short-term morbidity and mortality with regard to the surgical procedure. ResultsâRepair rate was 72%. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality were 4 and 20%, respectively. The only patient with early mortality received the surgical procedure on the tricuspid valve as fourth cardiac-related surgery and postoperative mortality was due to intracranial air embolism. Perioperative morbidity included reoperation for bleeding (8%) and stroke (4%). No disturbance of wound healing occurred. Durations of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay were 2.3âÂ±â2.4 and 17.4âÂ±â13.1 days, respectively. Endocarditis-caused surgery did not reveal any significant difference in the intra- or perioperative course compared with other indications. ConclusionâMinimally invasive TVS via right lateral minithoracotomy is feasible with good results. Even in a cohort of patients suffering from elevated rate of active endocarditis, a high repair rate can be achieved.


Title #115: Rapid Genotyping of Animals Followed by Establishing Primary Cultures of Brain Neurons.
PMID: 25742545
Authors: Jin-Young JY. Koh, Sadahiro S. Iwabuchi, Zhengmin Z. Huang, N Charles NC. Harata
Abstract: High-resolution analysis of the morphology and function of mammalian neurons often requires the genotyping of individual animals followed by the analysis of primary cultures of neurons. We describe a set of procedures for: labeling newborn mice to be genotyped, rapid genotyping, and establishing low-density cultures of brain neurons from these mice. Individual mice are labeled by tattooing, which allows for long-term identification lasting into adulthood. Genotyping by the described protocol is fast and efficient, and allows for automated extraction of nucleic acid with good reliability. This is useful under circumstances where sufficient time for conventional genotyping is not available, e.g., in mice that suffer from neonatal lethality. Primary neuronal cultures are generated at low density, which enables imaging experiments at high spatial resolution. This culture method requires the preparation of glial feeder layers prior to neuronal plating. The protocol is applied in its entirety to a mouse model of the movement disorder DYT1 dystonia (ÎE-torsinA knock-in mice), and neuronal cultures are prepared from the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum of these mice. This protocol can be applied to mice with other genetic mutations, as well as to animals of other species. Furthermore, individual components of the protocol can be used for isolated sub-projects. Thus this protocol will have wide applications, not only in neuroscience but also in other fields of biological and medical sciences.

Abstract: In recent years, new products have entered the marketplace that complicate decisions about tobacco control policies and prevention in the workplace. These products, called electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or electronic nicotine delivery systems, most often deliver nicotine as an aerosol for inhalation, without combustion of tobacco. This new mode of nicotine delivery raises several questions about the safety of the product for the user, the effects of secondhand exposure, how the public use of these products should be handled within tobacco-free and smoke-free air policies, and how their use affects tobacco cessation programs, wellness incentives, and other initiatives to prevent and control tobacco use. In this article, we provide a background on e-cigarettes and then outline key policy recommendations for employers on how the use of these new devices should be managed within worksite tobacco prevention programs and control policies.

Title #129: An Optogenetic Approach for Assessing Formation of Neuronal Connections in a Co-culture System.
PMID: 25742527
Authors: Colin T E CT. Su, Su-In SI. Yoon, Guillaume G. Marcy, Eunice W M EW. Chin, George J GJ. Augustine, Eyleen L K EL. Goh
Abstract: Here we describe a protocol to generate a co-culture consisting of 2 different neuronal populations. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are reprogrammed from human fibroblasts using episomal vectors. Colonies of iPSCs can be observed 30 days after initiation of fibroblast reprogramming. Pluripotent colonies are manually picked and grown in neural induction medium to permit differentiation into neural progenitor cells (NPCs). iPSCs rapidly convert into neuroepithelial cells within 1 week and retain the capability to self-renew when maintained at a high culture density. Primary mouse NPCs are differentiated into astrocytes by exposure to a serum-containing medium for 7 days and form a monolayer upon which embryonic day 18 (E18) rat cortical neurons (transfected with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)) are added. Human NPCs tagged with the fluorescent protein, tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato), are then seeded onto the astrocyte/cortical neuron culture the following day and allowed to differentiate for 28 to 35 days. We demonstrate that this system forms synaptic connections between iPSC-derived neurons and cortical neurons, evident from an increase in the frequency of synaptic currents upon photostimulation of the cortical neurons. This co-culture system provides a novel platform for evaluating the ability of iPSC-derived neurons to create synaptic connections with other neuronal populations.


Title #130: Innervated Reverse Digital Artery Island Flap through Bilateral Neurorrhaphy using Direct Small Branches of the Proper Digital Nerve.
PMID: 25742525
Authors: Jihyeung J. Kim, Young Ho YH. Lee, Min Bom MB. Kim, Seung Hoo SH. Lee, Goo Hyun GH. Baek
Abstract: The reverse digital artery flap uses the radial or ulnar surface of the proximal phalanx of the involved digit, and has been applied to sensate flaps using the superficial sensory nerve branch and the dorsal branch of the proper digital nerve. However, as these nerve branches innervate the dorsal surface of the finger, hypesthesia of the dorsal side of the middle phalanx is inevitable.

Title #134: Synergetic Use of Neural Precursor Cells and Self-assembling Peptides in Experimental Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.
PMID: 25742521
Authors: Klaus K. Zweckberger, Yang Y. Liu, Jian J. Wang, Nicole N. Forgione, Michael G MG. Fehlings
Abstract: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause serious neurological impairment and psychological, economic, and social consequences for patients and their families. Clinically, more than 50% of SCI affect the cervical spine(1). As a consequence of the primary injury, a cascade of secondary mechanisms including inflammation, apoptosis, and demyelination occur finally leading to tissue scarring and development of intramedullary cavities(2,3). Both represent physical and chemical barriers to cell transplantation, integration, and regeneration. Therefore, shaping the inhibitory environment and bridging cavities to create a supportive milieu for cell transplantation and regeneration is a promising therapeutic target(4). Here, a contusion/compression model of cervical SCI using an aneurysm clip is described. This model is more clinically relevant than other experimental models, since complete transection or ruptures of the cord are rare. Also in comparison to the weight drop model, which in particular damage the dorsum columns, circumferential compression of the spinal cord appears advantageous. Clip closing force and duration can be adjusted to achieve different injury severity. A ring spring facilitates precise calibration and constancy of clip force. Under physiological conditions, synthetic self-assembling peptides (SAP) self-assemble into nanofibers and thus, are appealing for application in SCI(5). They can be injected directly into the lesion minimizing damage to the cord. SAPs are biocompatible structures erecting scaffolds to bridge intramedullary cavities and thus, equip the damaged cord for regenerative treatments. K2(QL)6K2 (QL6) is a novel SAP introduced by Dong et al.(6) In comparison to other peptides, QL6 self-assembles into Î²-sheets at neutral pH(6).14 days after SCI, after the acute stage, SAPs are injected into the center of the lesion and neural precursor cells (NPC) are injected into adjacent dorsal columns. In order to support cell survival, transplantation is combined with continuous subdural administration of growth factors by osmotic micro pumps for 7 days.


Title #135: In Vivo Tractography of Fetal Association Fibers.
PMID: 25742520
Authors: Christian C. Mitter, Daniela D. Prayer, Peter C PC. Brugger, Michael M. Weber, Gregor G. Kasprian
Abstract: Association fibers connect different cortical areas within the same hemisphere and constitute an essential anatomical substrate for a diverse range of higher cognitive functions. So far a comprehensive description of the prenatal in vivo morphology of these functionally important pathways is lacking. In the present study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography were used to visualize major association fiber tracts and the fornix in utero in preselected non-motion degraded DTI datasets of 24 living unsedated fetuses between 20 and 34 gestational weeks (GW). The uncinate fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were depicted as early as 20 GW, while in vivo 3D visualization of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum and fornix was successful in older fetuses during the third trimester. Provided optimal scanning conditions, in utero DTI and tractography have the potential to provide a more accurate anatomical definition of developing neuronal networks in the human fetal brain. Knowledge about the normal prenatal 3D association tract morphology may serve as reference for their assessment in common developmental diseases.


Title #136: An XRCC4 splice mutation is associated with severe short stature, gonadal failure, and early-onset metabolic syndrome.
PMID: 25742519

Kuang, Dan D. Hanson, Peter P. Clayton, Dik C DC. van Gent, Jan M JM. Wit, Vivian V. Hwa, Andrew A. Dauber
Abstract: Context: Severe short stature can be caused by defects in numerous biological processes including defects in IGF-1 signaling, centromere function, cell cycle control and DNA damage repair. Many syndromic causes of short stature are associated with medical co-morbidities including hypogonadism and microcephaly. Objective: To identify an underlying genetic etiology in two siblings with severe short stature and gonadal failure. Design: Clinical phenotyping, genetic analysis, complemented by in vitro functional studies of candidate gene Setting: Academic pediatric endocrinology clinic Patients or Other Participants: Two adult siblings (male P1 and female P2) presented with a history of severe postnatal growth failure (adult heights P1: -6.8, P2: -4 SDS), microcephaly, primary gonadal failure and early-onset metabolic syndrome in late adolescence. In addition, P2 developed a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor at age 28. Intervention(s): SNP microarray and exome sequencing Results: Combined microarray analysis and whole exome sequencing of the two affected and one unaffected siblings identified a homozygous variant in XRCC4 as the probable candidate variant. Sanger sequencing and mRNA studies revealed a splice variant resulting in an in-frame deletion of 23 amino acids. Primary fibroblasts (P1) showed a DNA damage repair defect. Conclusions: In this study we have identified a novel pathogenic variant in XRCC4, a gene which plays a critical role in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair. This finding expands the spectrum of DNA damage repair syndromes to include XRCC4 deficiency causing severe postnatal growth failure, microcephaly, gonadal failure, metabolic syndrome and possibly tumor predisposition.


Title #137: Obesity, Diabetes, and Associated Costs of Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union.
PMID: 25742518

Abstract: Context: Obesity and diabetes are epidemic in the European Union (EU). Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is increasingly recognized as a contributor, independent of diet and physical activity. Objective: To estimate obesity, diabetes, and associated costs that can be reasonably attributed to EDC exposures in the EU. Design: An expert panel evaluated evidence for probability of causation using weight-of-evidence characterization adapted from that applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated for relevant EDCs, and biomarker data were organized from peer-reviewed studies to represent European exposure and burden of disease. Cost estimation as of 2010 utilized published cost estimates for childhood obesity, adult obesity, and adult diabetes. Setting, Patients and Participants, and Intervention: Cost estimation was performed from the societal perspective. Results: The panel identified a 40% to 69% probability of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene causing 1555 cases of overweight at age 10 (sensitivity analysis: 1555-5463) in 2010 with associated costs of â¬24.6 million (sensitivity analysis: â¬24.6-86.4 million). A 20% to 39% probability was identified for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene causing 28 200 cases of adult diabetes (sensitivity analysis: 28 200-56 400) with associated costs of â¬835 million (sensitivity analysis: â¬835 million-16.6 billion). The panel also identified a 40% to 69% probability of phthalate exposure causing 53 900 cases of obesity in older women and â¬15.6 billion in associated costs. Phthalate exposure was also found to have a 40% to 69% probability of causing 20 500 new-onset cases of diabetes in older women with â¬607 million in associated costs. Prenatal bisphenol A exposure was identified to have a 20% to 69% probability of causing 42 400 cases of childhood obesity, with associated lifetime costs of â¬1.54 billion. Conclusions: EDC exposures in the EU contribute substantially to obesity and diabetes, with a moderate probability of >â¬18 billion costs per year. This is a conservative estimate; the results emphasize the need to control EDC exposures.

Abstract: Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute to male reproductive diseases and disorders. Purpose: To estimate the incidence/prevalence of selected male reproductive disorders/diseases and associated economic costs that can be reasonably attributed to specific EDC exposures in the European Union (EU). Methods: An expert panel evaluated evidence for probability of causation using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change weight-of-evidence characterization. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated, and biomarker data were organized from carefully identified studies from the peer-reviewed literature to represent European exposure and approximate burden of disease as it occurred in 2010. The cost-of-illness estimation utilized multiple peer-reviewed sources. Results: The expert panel identified low epidemiological and strong toxicological evidence for male infertility attributable to phthalate exposure, with a 40-69% probability of causing 618 000 additional assisted reproductive technology procedures, costing â¬4.71 billion annually. Low epidemiological and strong toxicological evidence was also identified for cryptorchidism due to prenatal polybrominated diphenyl ether exposure, resulting in a 40-69% probability that 4615 cases result, at a cost of â¬130 million (sensitivity analysis, â¬117-130 million). A much more modest (0-19%) probability of causation in testicular cancer by polybrominated diphenyl ethers was identified due to very low epidemiological and weak toxicological evidence, with 6830 potential cases annually and costs of â¬848 million annually (sensitivity analysis, â¬313-848 million). The panel assigned 40-69% probability of lower T concentrations in 55- to 64-year-old men due to phthalate exposure, with 24 800 associated deaths annually and lost economic productivity of â¬7.96 billion. Conclusions: EDCs may contribute substantially to male reproductive disorders and diseases, with nearly â¬15 billion annual associated costs in the EU. These estimates represent only a few EDCs for which there were sufficient epidemiological studies and those with the highest probability of causation. These public health costs should be considered as the EU contemplates regulatory action on EDCs.


Title #139: Estimating Burden and Disease Costs of Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union.
PMID: 25742516
Authors: Leonardo L. Trasande, R Thomas RT. Zoeller, Ulla U. Hass, Andreas A. Kortenkamp, Philippe P. Grandjean, John Peterson JP. Myers, Joseph J. DiGangi, Martine M. Bellanger, Russ R. Hauser, Juliette J. Legler, Niels E NE. Skakkebaek, Jerrold J JJ. Heindel
Abstract: Context: Rapidly increasing evidence has documented that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute substantially to disease and disability. Objective: The objective was to quantify a range of health and economic costs that can be reasonably attributed to EDC exposures in the European Union (EU). Design: A Steering Committee of scientists adapted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change weight-of-evidence characterization for probability of causation based upon levels of available epidemiological and toxicological evidence for one or more chemicals contributing to disease by an endocrine disruptor mechanism. To evaluate the epidemiological evidence, the Steering Committee adapted the World Health Organization Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria, whereas the Steering Committee adapted definitions recently promulgated by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency for evaluating laboratory and animal evidence of endocrine disruption. Expert panels used the Delphi method to make decisions on the strength of the data. Results: Expert panels achieved consensus at least for probable (>20%) EDC causation for IQ loss and associated intellectual disability, autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, childhood obesity, adult obesity, adult diabetes, cryptorchidism, male infertility, and mortality associated with reduced testosterone. Accounting for probability of causation and using the midpoint of each range for probability of causation, Monte Carlo simulations produced a median cost of â¬157 billion (or $209 billion, corresponding to 1.23% of EU gross domestic product) annually across 1000 simulations. Notably, using the lowest end of the probability range for each relationship in the Monte Carlo simulations produced a median range of â¬109 billion that differed modestly from base case probability inputs. Conclusions: EDC exposures in the EU are likely to contribute substantially to disease and dysfunction across the life course with costs in the hundreds of billions of Euros per year. These estimates represent only those EDCs with the highest probability of causation; a broader analysis would have produced greater estimates of burden of disease and costs.


Title #140: Neurobehavioral Deficits, Diseases and Associated Costs of Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union.

Authors: Martine M. Bellanger, Barbara B. Demeneix, Philippe P. Grandjean, R Thomas RT. Zoeller, Leonardo L. Trasande
Abstract: Context: Epidemiological studies and animal models demonstrate that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute to cognitive deficits and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Objective: To estimate neurodevelopmental disability and associated costs that can be reasonably attributed to EDC exposure in the European Union. Design: An expert panel applied a weight-of-evidence characterization adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated for relevant EDCs, and biomarker data were organized from peer-reviewed studies to represent European exposure and approximate burden of disease. Cost estimation as of 2010 utilized lifetime economic productivity estimates, lifetime cost estimates for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and annual costs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Setting, Patients and Participants and Intervention: Cost estimation was carried out from a societal perspective, i.e. including direct costs (e.g. treatment costs) and indirect costs such as productivity loss. Results: The panel identified 70-100% probability that polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and organophosphate (OP) exposures contribute to IQ loss in the European population. PBDE exposures were associated with 873,000 (sensitivity analysis: 148,000-2.02 million) lost IQ points and 3,290 (sensitivity analysis: 3,290-8,080) cases of intellectual disability, at costs of â¬9.59 billion (sensitivity analysis: â¬1.58-22.4 billion). OP exposures were associated with 13.0 billion (sensitivity analysis: 4.24-17.1 billion) lost IQ points and 59,300 (sensitivity analysis: 16,500-84,400) cases of intellectual disability, at costs of â¬146 billion (sensitivity analysis: â¬46.8-194 billion). ASD causation by multiple EDCs was assigned a 20-39% probability, with 316 (sensitivity analysis: 126-631) attributable cases at a cost of â¬199 million (sensitivity analysis: â¬79.7-399 million). ADHD causation by multiple EDCs was assigned a 20-69% probability, with 19,300-31,200 attributable cases at a cost of â¬1.21-2.86 billion. Conclusions: EDC exposures in Europe contribute substantially to neurobehavioral deficits and disease, with a high probability of >â¬150 billion costs/year. These results emphasize the advantages of controlling EDC exposure.


Title #141: Recovery of the Incretin Effect in Type 2 Diabetic Patients After Biliopancreatic Diversion.

Abstract: Context: Bariatric surgery often results in remission of the diabetic state in obese patients. Increased incretin effect seems to play an important role in the glycemic improvements after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but the impact of biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) remains unexplored. Objective: To elucidate the effect of BPD on the incretin effect and its interplay with beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity (IS) in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Design, Setting and Patients: Twenty-three women were studied: a control group of 13 lean, normal glucose-tolerant women (lean NGT) studied once and 10 obese patients with T2DM studied before, 1 and 12 months after BPD. Intervention: The ObeseT2DM group underwent BPD. Main Outcome Measures: The change in incretin effect as measured by the isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion test. Secondary outcomes encompassed IS and beta-cell function. Results: At baseline, the incretin effect was lower in obese T2DM compared to lean NGT (p<0.05). One month after BPD, the incretin effect was not changed, but at 12 months it reached the level of the lean NGT group (p>0.05). IS improved (p<0.05) 1 month after BPD and at 12 months it resembled the levels of the lean NGT group. Insulin secretory rate and beta-cell glucose sensitivity increased after BPD and achieved levels similar to lean NGT group 1 month after BPD and even higher levels at 12 months (p<0.05). Conclusions: BPD has no acute impact on the reduced incretin effect, but 12 months after surgery the incretin effect normalizes alongside normalization of glucose control, IS and beta-cell function.

Abstract: Context: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is an important public health problem worldwide for its increasing prevalence and potential deleterious effects, while its etiology has not been fully elucidated. Lipotoxicity exerts extensive and serious impact on human health, but so far, the potential effect of lipotoxicity on thyroid is unclear. Objective: To assess the association between serum triglyceride levels and the risk for SCH. Design, participants and methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study. A total of 24,100 subjects with similar and stable iodine nutrition status were recruited from China. Cases of 5,033 SCH patients were identified and equal controls were matched by age, gender and region. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the association between serum triglyceride levels and risk for SCH. Results: Hypertriglyceridemia was associated with approximately a 35% increased risk for SCH in both men (odds ratio [OR], 1.325; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.002-1.753) and women (OR, 1.397; 95% CI, 1.217-1.604) even after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the risk for SCH increased progressively following the elevation of serum triglyceride levels. Compared with individuals with serum triglyceride levels < 0.97 mmol/L, the risk for SCH increased approximately 1.9-fold in men and 1.4-fold in women, respectively, when triglyceride levels were greater than 1.99 mmol/L. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that hypertriglyceridemia was positively associated with the risk for SCH.

Abstract: Context: The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is still incompletely understood. In-depth phenotyping of young individuals at risk for T2D can contribute to the understanding of this process. Objective: To metabolically characterize women with recent gestational diabetes (GDM), an at-risk cohort for T2D. Study participants: 147 consecutively recruited women 3-16 months after pregnancy, women who had GDM and women after a normoglycemic pregnancy (controls) in a 2:1 ratio Design: Mono-center cross-sectional analysis (PPS-Diab study) Methods: 5-point OGTT with calculation of insulin sensitivity (ISI) and disposition index (DI; validation by euglycemic clamp and IVGTT), anthropometrics, medical and family history, clinical chemistry and biomarkers, statistical modelling, MRI/MRS substudy (body fat distribution, liver and muscle fat; n=66) Results: Compared to control subjects, women post GDM had a reduced DI, higher levels of plasma fetuin-A and a lower ISI. A low ISI was also the major determinant of pathologic glucose tolerance after GDM. The factors most strongly predictive of low insulin sensitivity were high plasma leptin, BMI, triglycerides, and waist circumference. Ectopic lipids showed no BMI-independent associations with having had GDM or low insulin sensitivity in an MRI substudy. Conclusions: We found that beta cell function is already impaired in women with recent GDM, a young at-risk cohort for T2D. Additionally, our data suggest that fetuin-A and leptin signaling may be important early contributors to the pathogenesis of T2D, at this disease stage equally or more relevant than ectopic lipids and low-grade inflammation.


Title #144: Annotated Differentially Expressed Salivary Proteins of Susceptible and Insecticide-Resistant Mosquitoes of Anopheles stephensi.

Abstract: Vector control is one of the major global strategies for control of malaria. However, the major obstacle for vector control is the development of multiple resistances to organochlorine, organophosphorus insecticides and pyrethroids that are currently being used in public health for spraying and in bednets. Salivary glands of vectors are the first target organ for human-vector contact during biting and parasite-vector contact prior to parasite development in the mosquito midguts. The salivary glands secrete anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory biologically active molecules to facilitate blood feeding from the host and also inadvertently inject malaria parasites into the vertebrate host. The Anopheles stephensi mosquito, an urban vector of malaria to both human and rodent species has been identified as a reference laboratory model to study mosquito-parasite interactions. In this study, we adopted a conventional proteomic approach of 2D-electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to identify putative differentially expressed annotated functional salivary proteins between An. stephensi susceptible and multiresistant strains with same genetic background. Our results show 2D gel profile and MALDI-TOF comparisons that identified 31 differentially expressed putative modulated proteins in deltamethrin/DDT resistant strains of An. stephensi. Among these 15 proteins were found to be upregulated and 16 proteins were downregulated. Our studies interpret that An. stephensi (multiresistant) caused an upregulated expression of proteins and enzymes like cytochrome 450, short chain dehyrdogenase reductase, phosphodiesterase etc that may have an impact in insecticide resistance and xenobiotic detoxification. Our study elucidates a proteomic response of salivary glands differentially regulated proteins in response to insecticide resistance development which include structural, redox and regulatory enzymes of several pathways. These identified proteins may play a role in regulating mosquito biting behavior patterns and may have implications in the development of malaria parasites in resistant mosquitoes during parasite transmission.

Abstract: Crescentic glomerulonephritis (CresGN), an uncommon rapidly progressive disease, is characterized by severe glomerular inflammation with fibrin deposition. The lack of specific CresGN biomarkers delays diagnosis and threatens life. Because fibrin deposits in CresGN glomeruli indicate thrombin generation, we hypothesized that thrombin is excreted in urine and is a specific CresGN biomarker.


Title #147: Effect of Substrate Temperature on Pattern Formation of Nanoparticles from Volatile Drops.

Abstract: This study investigates pattern formation during evaporation of water based nanofluid sessile droplets placed on a smooth silicon surface at various temperatures. An infrared thermography technique was employed to observe the temperature distribution along the air-liquid interface of evaporating droplets. In addition, an optical interferometry technique is used to quantify and characterize the deposited patterns. Depending on the substrate temperature, three distinctive deposition patterns are observed; a nearly uniform coverage pattern, a "dual-ring" pattern and multiple rings corresponding to "stick-slip" pattern. At all substrate temperatures, the internal flow within the drop builds a ring-like cluster of the solute on the top region of drying droplets, which is found essential for the formation of the secondary ring deposition onto the substrate for the deposits with the "dual-ring" pattern. The size of the secondary ring is found to be dependent on the substrate temperature. For the deposits with the rather uniform coverage pattern, the ring-like cluster of the solute does not deposit as a distinct secondary ring instead it is deformed by the contact line depinning. In the case of the "stick-slip" pattern, the internal flow behavior is complex and found to be vigorous with rapid circulating flow appears near the edge of the drop.


Title #148: Tracing copper derived from pig manure in calcareous soils and soil leachates by 65Cu labeling.

Abstract: Copper is used as a growth promoter in animal husbandry, resulting in high Cu concentrations in animal manure. We tested whether Cu would be mobilized in soils receiving excessive loads of manure, both from recently added and from aged fractions. To discriminate between these Cu sources, manure was labelled with 65Cu. After soil application of 0, 15, and 30 Mg manure ha-1, leachate was collected in free-draining lysimeters (40 cm depth) under undisturbed soil over a 53 day period. Determining total amounts of Cu, and the fractions of 65Cu in leachate and soil profile enabled us to trace the translocation of Cu deriving from labelled manure. More than 84% of the applied Cu was retained in the top 2 cm of soil. Less than 0.01% of the applied Cu were overall detected in the leachate. Of this amount, however, 38% (Â±8.9 SE) was leached within 8 days after application. The total Cu concentration in leachates (32-164 Âµg l-1) frequently exceeded the Chinese groundwater quality standard of 50 Âµg l-1. The added 65Cu however, accounted for less than 3.6% of the total Cu leaching load, suggesting that Cu from older sources and/or geological background controls contamination, regardless of current land management.


Title #149: Operant Procedures for Assessing Behavioral Flexibility in Rats.
PMID: 25742506
Authors: Anne Marie AM. Brady, Stan B SB. Floresco
Abstract: Executive functions consist of multiple high-level cognitive processes that drive rule generation and behavioral selection. An emergent property of these processes is the ability to adjust behavior in response to changes in one's environment (i.e., behavioral flexibility). These processes are essential to normal human behavior, and may be disrupted in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, alcoholism, depression, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding of the neurobiology of executive functions has been greatly advanced by the availability of animal tasks for assessing discrete components of behavioral flexibility, particularly strategy shifting and reversal learning. While several types of tasks have been developed, most are non-automated, labor intensive, and allow testing of only one animal at a time. The recent development of automated, operant-based tasks for assessing behavioral flexibility streamlines testing, standardizes stimulus presentation and data recording, and dramatically improves throughput. Here, we describe automated strategy shifting and reversal tasks, using operant chambers controlled by custom written software programs. Using these tasks, we have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex governs strategy shifting but not reversal learning in the rat, similar to the dissociation observed in humans. Moreover, animals with a neonatal hippocampal lesion, a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, are selectively impaired on the strategy shifting task but not the reversal task. The strategy shifting task also allows the identification of separate types of performance errors, each of which is attributable to distinct neural substrates. The availability of these automated tasks, and the evidence supporting the dissociable contributions of separate prefrontal areas, makes them particularly well-suited assays for the investigation of basic neurobiological processes as well as drug discovery and screening in disease models.


Title #150: The Effect of Meteorological Variables on the Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Four Major Cities of Shanxi Province, China: A Time Series Data Analysis (2009-2013).
PMID: 25742504

Abstract: Increased incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been recognized as a critical challenge to communicable disease control and public health response. This study aimed to quantify the association between climate variation and notified cases of HFMD in selected cities of Shanxi Province, and to provide evidence for disease control and prevention. Meteorological variables and HFMD cases data in 4 major cities (Datong, Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng) of Shanxi province, China, were obtained from the China Meteorology Administration and China CDC respectively over the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Correlations analyses and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to identify and quantify the relationship between the meteorological variables and HFMD. HFMD incidence varied seasonally with the majority of cases in the 4 cities occurring from May to July. Temperatures could play important roles in the incidence of HFMD in these regions. The SARIMA models indicate that a 1Â° C rise in average, maximum and minimum temperatures may lead to a similar relative increase in the number of cases in the 4 cities. The lag times for the effects of temperatures were identified in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng. The numbers of cases were positively associated with average and minimum temperatures at a lag of 1 week in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng, and with maximum temperature at a lag of 2 weeks in Yuncheng. Positive association between the temperature and HFMD has been identified from the 4 cities in Shanxi Province, although the role of weather variables on the transmission of HFMD varied in the 4 cities. Relevant prevention measures and public health action are required to reduce future risks of climate change with consideration of local climatic conditions.

Title #153: Evidence of Water Molecules - A Statistical Evaluation of Water Molecules Based on Electron Density.
PMID: 25742501
Authors: Eva E. Nittinger, Nadine N. Schneider, Gudrun G. Lange, Matthias M. Rarey
Abstract: Water molecules play important roles in many biological processes, especially when mediating protein-ligand interactions. Dehydration and the hydrophobic effect are of central importance for estimating binding affinities. Due to the specific geometric characteristics of hydrogen bond functions of water molecules, meaning two acceptor and two donor functions in a tetrahedral arrangement, they have to be modeled accurately. Despite many attempts in the past years, accurate prediction of water molecules - structurally as well as energetically - remains a grand challenge. One reason is certainly the lack of experimental data, since energetic contributions of water molecules can only be measured indirectly. However, on the structural side the electron density clearly shows the positions of stable water molecules. This information has the potential to improve models on water structure and energy in proteins and protein interfaces. Based on a high-resolution subset of the Protein Data Bank, we have conducted an extensive statistical analysis of 2.3 million water molecules, discriminating those water molecules that are well resolved and those without much evidence of electron density. In order to perform this classification, we introduce a new measurement of electron density around an individual atom enabling the automatic quantification of experimental support. Based on this measurement, we present an analysis of water molecules with a detailed profile of geometric and structural features. This data, which is freely available, can not only be applied to modeling and validation of new water models in structural biology but also in molecular design.

Title #155: miR-186 and 326 Predict the Prognosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Affect the Proliferation and Migration of Cancer Cells.
PMID: 25742499

Abstract: MicroRNAs can function as key tumor suppressors or oncogenes and act as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Although high-throughput assays have revealed many miRNA biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), only a few have been validated in independent populations or investigated for functional significance in PDAC pathogenesis. In this study, we correlated the expression of 36 potentially prognostic miRNAs within PDAC tissue with clinico-pathological features and survival in 151 Chinese patients. We then analyzed the functional roles and target genes of two miRNAs in PDAC development. We found that high expression of miR-186 and miR-326 predict poor and improved survival, respectively. miR-186 was over-expressed in PDAC patients compared with controls, especially in patients with large tumors (>2 cm), lymph node metastasis, or short-term survival (< 24 months). In contrast, miR-326 was down-regulated in patients compared with controls and displayed relatively increased expression in the patients with long-term survival or without venous invasion. Functional experiments revealed that PDAC cell proliferation and migration was decreased following inhibition and enhanced following over-expression of miR-186. In contrast, it was enhanced following inhibition and decreased after over-expression of miR-326. A luciferase assay indicated that miR-186 can bind directly to the 3'-UTR of NR5A2 to repress gene expression. These findings suggest that miR-186 over-expression contributes to the invasive potential of PDAC, likely via suppression of NR5A2, thereby leading to a poor prognosis; high miR-326 expression prolongs survival likely via the decreasing invasive potential of PDAC cells. These two miRNAs can be used as markers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis, and they represent therapeutic targets for PDAC.


Title #156: NMR studies of the equilibria and reaction rates in aqueous solutions of formaldehyde.
PMID: 25742498
Authors: Michal M. Rivlin, Uzi U. Eliav, Gil G. Navon
Abstract: Formaldehyde has an important role in the chemical industry and in biological sciences. In dilute aqueous solutions of formaldehyde only traces of the molecular formaldehyde are present and the predominant species are methylene glycol and in lower concentrations, dimethylene glycol. The chemical equilibria and reaction rates of the hydration of formaldehyde in H2O and D2O solutions at low concentrations were studied by (1)H and (13)C NMR at various conditions of pH (1.8-7.8) and temperature (278-333K). These measurements became possible by direct detection of formaldehyde (13)C and (1)H peaks. The equilibrium and rate constants of the dimerization reaction of methylene glycol were also measured. The rate constants for both the hydration and the dimerization reactions were measured by a new version of the conventional selective inversion transfer method. This study, together with previous published work, completes the description of dynamics and equilibria of all the processes occurring in dilute aqueous formaldehyde solutions.

Abstract: The formation of blood vessels is a vital process in embryonic development and in normal physiology. Current vascular modelling is mainly based on animal biology leading to species-to-species variation when extrapolating the results to humans. Although there are a few human cell based vascular models available these assays are insufficiently characterized in terms of culture conditions and developmental stage of vascular structures. Therefore, well characterized vascular models with human relevance are needed for basic research, embryotoxicity testing, development of therapeutic strategies and for tissue engineering. We have previously shown that the in vitro vascular model based on co-culture of human adipose stromal cells (hASC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is able to induce an extensive vascular-like network with high reproducibility. In this work we developed a defined serum-free vascular stimulation medium (VSM) and performed further characterization in terms of cell identity, maturation and structure to obtain a thoroughly characterized in vitro vascular model to replace or reduce corresponding animal experiments. The results showed that the novel vascular stimulation medium induced intact and evenly distributed vascular-like network with morphology of mature vessels. Electron microscopic analysis assured the three-dimensional microstructure of the network containing lumen. Additionally, elevated expressions of the main human angiogenesis-related genes were detected. In conclusion, with the new defined medium the vascular model can be utilized as a characterized test system for chemical testing as well as in creating vascularized tissue models.

Abstract: Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the first committed step in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. In this study, the cDNA (FhCHS1) encoding CHS from Freesia hybrida was successfully isolated and analyzed. Multiple sequence alignments showed that both the conserved CHS active site residues and CHS signature sequence were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of FhCHS1. Meanwhile, crystallographic analysis revealed that protein structure of FhCHS1 is highly similar to that of alfalfa CHS2, and the biochemical analysis results indicated that it has an enzymatic role in naringenin biosynthesis. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the transcript levels of FhCHS1 in flowers and different tissues, and patterns of FhCHS1 expression in flowers showed significant correlation to the accumulation patterns of anthocyanin during flower development. To further characterize the functionality of FhCHS1, its ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana tt4 mutants and Petunia hybrida was performed. The results showed that overexpression of FhCHS1 in tt4 mutants fully restored the pigmentation phenotype of the seed coats, cotyledons and hypocotyls, while transgenic petunia expressing FhCHS1 showed flower color alteration from white to pink. In summary, these results suggest that FhCHS1 plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of flavonoid in Freesia hybrida and may be used to modify the components of flavonoids in other plants.

Abstract: A series of N-ethyl phthalimide esters 4(a-n) were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic studies. Further, the molecular structure of majority of compounds were analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The X-ray analysis revealed the importance of substituents on the crystal stability and molecular packing. All the synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro antioxidant activity by DPPH radical scavenging, FRAP and CUPRAC methods. Few of them have shown good antioxidant activity.


Title #161: Bora Downregulation Results in Radioresistance by Promoting Repair of Double Strand Breaks.
PMID: 25742493
Authors: Junmei J. Cairns, Yi Y. Peng, Vivien C VC. Yee, Zhenkun Z. Lou, Liewei L. Wang
Abstract: Following DNA double-strand breaks cells activate several DNA-damage response protein kinases, which then trigger histone H2AX phosphorylation and the accumulation of proteins such as MDC1, p53-binding protein 1, and breast cancer gene 1 at the damage site to promote DNA double-strand breaks repair. We identified a novel biomarker, Bora (previously called C13orf34), that is associated with radiosensitivity. In the current study, we set out to investigate how Bora might be involved in response to irradiation. We found a novel function of Bora in DNA damage repair response. Bora down-regulation increased colony formation in cells exposed to irradiation. This increased resistance to irradiation in Bora-deficient cells is likely due to a faster rate of double-strand breaks repair. After irradiation, Bora-knockdown cells displayed increased G2-M cell cycle arrest and increased Chk2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Bora specifically interacted with the tandem breast cancer gene 1 C-terminal domain of MDC1 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, and overexpression of Bora could abolish irradiation induced MDC1 foci formation. In summary, Bora may play a significant role in radiosensitivity through the regulation of MDC1 and DNA repair.

Title #163: An in situ growth approach to the fabrication of zeolite imidazolate framework-90 bonded capillary column for gas chromatography separation.
PMID: 25742491
Authors: Ye-Yu YY. Wu, Cheng-Xiong CX. Yang, Xiu-Ping XP. Yan
Abstract: The unique properties of metal-organic frameworks, such as diversity in structures and pore sizes, high surface area, shape selectivity and available to functionality make them as potential materials of the stationary phase for gas chromatography. Here we show an in situ growth approach to the fabrication of zeolite imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) bonded capillary column for gas chromatography separation. ZIF-90 was directly grown onto the inner wall of the carboxyl modified capillary via the coordination between Zn(ii) and carboxyl group. The fabricated ZIF-90 bonded capillary column acted as a weak polar stationary phase. It not only exhibits high capacity in the separation of linear molecules, but also offers excellent features for the separation of 2- and 3-substituted ketones.


Title #164: Palladium-Catalyzed Intramolecular Aminoacetoxylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Hydrogen Peroxide as Oxidant.

Authors: Haitao H. Zhu, Pinhong P. Chen, Guosheng G. Liu
Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed intramolecular aminoacetoxylation of unactivated alkenes was developed in which H2O2 was used as the sole oxidant. A variety of 3-acetoxylated piperidines were obtained in good yields with good to excellent regio- and diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic study revealed that the addition of di(2-pyridyl) ketone (dpk) ligand was crucial to promote the oxidative cleavage of the C-Pd(II) bond by H2O2 to give the C-OAc bond.

Title #166: Mechanism and Functional Implications of Heme-induced Binding Promiscuity of IgE.

Abstract: A fraction of antibodies from healthy immune repertoires binds to heme and acquires ability to recognize multiple antigens. The mechanism and functional consequences of heme-mediated antigen binding promiscuity (polyreactivity) are not understood. Here, we used SPE7, a mouse monoclonal IgE specific for dinitrophenyl that has been thoroughly characterized at the molecular level, as a model antibody to elucidate the mechanism and functional consequences of heme-mediated polyreactivity. We first demonstrate that exposure of SPE7 to heme results in a substantial increase in its antigen-binding polyreactivity. Comparison of the binding kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction of the native and heme-bound SPE7 indicates that the binding of heme to SPE7 confers binding affinities in the low nanomolar range towards several antigens, but has no influence on the mechanism of recognition of dinitrophenyl. In vitro cellular assays further demonstrate that heme-bound SPE7 does not promote the degranulation of basophils in the presence of new target antigens, while degranulation is observed in the presence of dinitrophenyl. Molecular docking and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed binding of heme to the variable region of SPE7 at distance from the conventional binding site for dinitrophenyl, explaining the extension of binding polyreactivity without abrogation of the interaction with its cognate antigen. In addition, our data suggest that heme, when bound to IgE, is solvent-exposed and may serve as an interfacial cofactor mediating binding to diverse proteins. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of heme-induced antibody polyreactivity. It also paves the way towards the delineation of the functional impact of polyreactivity and cross-reactivity of IgE.

Abstract: Skin moisturization is an important function of cosmetics in dermatology, and acquisition of two-dimensional information about the water content of facial skin is of great interest. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging using the water OH band centered near 1460 nm has been applied to the evaluation of water in skin. However, detection of small changes in the water content of skin water is difficult using this band because of the low absorption coefficient of water at that wavelength and inadequate optical units. We developed a high sensitivity water imaging system using strong water bands centered near 1920 nm. This system can be used for the entire face. With the water imaging system, time-dependent changes in the water content of moisturizer-treated skin and hair were visualized with high sensitivity. In this study, we performed a water distribution analysis, with the aim of understanding the water distribution in facial skin under different environmental conditions. The water imaging system combines a diffuse illumination unit and an extended-range indium-gallium arsenide NIR camera with a detection range of 1100-2200 nm. The skin water distributions for multiple subjects with different facial shapes and sizes were compared using averaged NIR image data and a mesh partition analysis using a developed algorithm. Changes in the facial skin water content with season and humidity were visualized by the algorithm. The water content decreased in autumn, especially near the eyes and upper-cheek. Compared to other areas on the face, the water content around the eyes decreased more during an 85 min stay in a room at 10% relative humidity. The proposed method for water distribution analysis provides a powerful tool for facial skin hydration research in dermatological and cosmetics fields.

Abstract: Background:Whether females have better survival than males in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is barely acknowledged and the exact explanations remain unknown.Methods:Overall, 5929 patients receiving treatment between January 2005 and December 2010 were separately stratified by stage into early and advanced stage groups, and by age into premenopausal (â©½45 years), menopausal (46-54 years) and postmenopausal (â©¾55 years) groups. Matched males and females in each group were identified using the propensity score matching method. Differences in disease-free survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.Results:Overall, 398, 923, 744, 319 and 313 pairs of males and females were matched in early stage, advanced stage, premenopausal, menopausal and postmenopausal group, respectively. Females showed significant advantage over males across all end points in both early and advanced stage groups (Pâ©½0.042). However, this advantage persisted at premenopausal age (Pâ©½0.042), declined during menopause (DMFS, P=0.021; DSS, P=0.100; OS, P=0.693; LRFS, P=0.330) and totally disappeared at postmenopausal age (Pâ©¾0.344).Conclusions:Sex significantly affects NPC survival, with a definite female advantage regardless of tumour stage. Intrinsic biologic traits appear to be the exact explanation according to the declining magnitude of sex effect with age.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.70 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #170: Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors alters the metabolism of human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells and xenograft tumours.

Abstract: Background:Acquired resistance to molecularly targeted therapeutics is a key challenge in personalised cancer medicine, highlighting the need for identifying the underlying mechanisms and early biomarkers of relapse, in order to guide subsequent patient management.Methods:Here we use human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) models and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess the metabolic changes that follow acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and which could serve as potential metabolic biomarkers of drug resistance.Results:Comparison of NMR metabolite profiles obtained from control (CAL(S)) and EGFR TKI-resistant (CAL(R)) cells grown as 2D monolayers, 3D spheroids or xenograft tumours in athymic mice revealed a number of differences between the sensitive and drug-resistant models. In particular, we observed elevated levels of glycerophosphocholine (GPC) in CAL(R) relative to CAL(S) monolayers, spheroids and tumours, independent of the growth rate or environment. In addition, there was an increase in alanine, aspartate and creatine+phosphocreatine in resistant spheroids and xenografts, and increased levels of lactate, branched-chain amino acids and a fall in phosphoethanolamine only in xenografts. The xenograft lactate build-up was associated with an increased expression of the glucose transporter GLUT-1, whereas the rise in GPC was attributed to inhibition of GPC phosphodiesterase. Reduced glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and phosphocholine were observed in a second HNSCC model probably indicative of a different drug resistance mechanism.Conclusions:Our studies reveal metabolic signatures associated not only with acquired EGFR TKI resistance but also growth pattern, microenvironment and contributing mechanisms in HNSCC models. These findings warrant further investigation as metabolic biomarkers of disease relapse in the clinic.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.86 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #171: Incidence and relevance of QTc-interval prolongation caused by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
PMID: 25742483

Abstract: Background:Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are associated with prolongation of the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The QTc-interval prolongation increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. However, studies evaluating the effects of TKIs on QTc intervals are limited and only consist of small patient numbers.Methods:In this multicentre trial in four centres in the Netherlands and Italy we screened all patients who were treated with any TKI. To evaluate the effects of TKIs on the QTc interval, we investigated ECGs before and during treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, or vemurafenib.Results:A total of 363 patients were eligible for the analyses. At baseline measurement, QTc intervals were significantly longer in females than in males (QTcfemales=404âms vs QTcmales=399âms, P=0.027). A statistically significant increase was observed for the individual TKIs sunitinib, vemurafenib, sorafenib, imatinib, and erlotinib, after the start of treatment (median ÎQTc ranging from +7 to +24âms, P<0.004). The CTCAE grade for QTc intervals significantly increased after start of treatment (P=0.0003). Especially patients who are treated with vemurafenib are at increased risk of developing a QTc of â©¾470âms, a threshold associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias.Conclusions:These observations show that most TKIs significantly increase the QTc interval. Particularly in vemurafenib-treated patients, the incidence of patients at risk for arrhythmias is increased. Therefore, especially in case of combined risk factors, ECG monitoring in patients treated with TKIs is strongly recommended.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.82 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #172: Novel therapeutic strategy targeting the Hedgehog signalling and mTOR pathways in biliary tract cancer.
PMID: 25742482

Abstract: Background:Activation of the PI3K/mTOR and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathways occurs frequently in biliary tract cancer (BTC). Crosstalk between these pathways occurs in other gastrointestinal cancers. The respective signalling inhibitors rapamycin and vismodegib may inhibit BTC synergistically and suppress cancer stem cells (CSCs).Methods:Gene expression profiling for p70S6k and Gli1 was performed with BTC cell lines. Tumour and pathway inhibitory effects of rapamycin and vismodegib were investigated in BTC preclinical models and CSCs.Results:Rapamycin and vismodegib synergistically reduced BTC cell viability and proliferation. This drug combination arrested BTC Mz-ChA-1 cells in the G1 phase but had no significant effect on the cell cycle of BTC Sk-ChA-1 cells. Combined treatment inhibited the proliferation of CSCs and ALDH-positive cells. Nanog and Oct-4 expression in CSCs was decreased by the combination treatment. Western blotting results showed the p-p70S6K, p-Gli1, p-mTOR, and p-AKT protein expression were inhibited by the combination treatment in BTC cells. In an Mz-ChA-1 xenograft model, combination treatment resulted in 80% inhibition of tumour growth and prolonged tumour doubling time. In 4 of 10 human BTC specimens, tumour p-p70S6K and Gli1 protein expression levels were decreased with the combination treatment.Conclusions:Targeted inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR and Hhpathways indicates a new avenue for BTC treatment with combination therapy.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.625 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #173: Age-specific risk of breast cancer in women with neurofibromatosis type 1.
PMID: 25742481
Authors: O O OO. Seminog, M J MJ. Goldacre
Abstract: Background:Young women with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are reported to have a higher risk of breast cancer than others, and this might have implications for screening programmes. Our aim was to calculate this risk.Methods:An all-England linked data set of hospital admissions and deaths was analysed to determine age-specific rates of breast cancer in women with NF1 and controls.Results:The age-specific excess risk of breast cancer, comparing the NF1 cohort with the control cohort, was elevated 6.5-fold (95% confidence interval 2.6-13.5) in women aged 30-39 years. There was a 4.4 (2.5-7.0) times higher risk among women aged 40-49.Conclusions:Women with NF1 develop breast cancer at younger ages than the general population.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.78 www.bjcancer.com.

Abstract: Background:Vegetable and/or fruit intakes in association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk have been investigated in case-control studies conducted in specific European countries and cohort studies conducted in Asia, with inconclusive results. No multi-centre European cohort has investigated the indicated associations.Methods:In 486â799 men/women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition, we identified 201 HCC cases after 11 years median follow-up. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC incidence for sex-specific quintiles and per 100âgâd(-1) increments of vegetable/fruit intakes.Results:Higher vegetable intake was associated with a statistically significant, monotonic reduction of HCC risk: HR (100âgâd(-1) increment): 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.98. This association was consistent in sensitivity analyses with no apparent heterogeneity across strata of HCC risk factors. Fruit intake was not associated with HCC incidence: HR (100âgâd(-1) increment): 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92-1.11.Conclusions:Vegetable, but not fruit, intake is associated with lower HCC risk with no evidence for heterogeneity of this association in strata of important HCC risk factors. Mechanistic studies should clarify pathways underlying this association. Given that HCC prognosis is poor and that vegetables are practically universally accessible, our results may be important, especially for those at high risk for the disease.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.654 www.bjcancer.com.

Terry, D. D. Cramer, R. R. Kaaks
Abstract: Background:Ovarian cancer has a high case-fatality ratio, largely due to late diagnosis. Epidemiologic risk prediction models could help identify women at increased risk who may benefit from targeted prevention measures, such as screening or chemopreventive agents.Methods:We built an ovarian cancer risk prediction model with epidemiologic risk factors from 202â206 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study.Results:Older age at menopause, longer duration of hormone replacement therapy, and higher body mass index were included as increasing ovarian cancer risk, whereas unilateral ovariectomy, longer duration of oral contraceptive use, and higher number of full-term pregnancies were decreasing risk. The discriminatory power (overall concordance index) of this model, as examined with five-fold cross-validation, was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57, 0.70). The ratio of the expected to observed number of ovarian cancer cases occurring in the first 5 years of follow-up was 0.90 (293 out of 324, 95% CI: 0.81-1.01), in general there was no evidence for miscalibration.Conclusion:Our ovarian cancer risk model containing only epidemiological data showed modest discriminatory power for a Western European population. Future studies should consider adding informative biomarkers to possibly improve the predictive ability of the model.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.22 www.bjcancer.com.

Abstract: Background:Somatic mutations affecting components of the Ras-MAPK pathway are a common feature of cancer, whereas germline Ras pathway mutations cause developmental disorders including Noonan, Costello, and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. These 'RASopathies' also represent cancer-prone syndromes, but the quantitative cancer risks remain unknown.Methods:We investigated the occurrence of childhood cancer including benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system in a group of 735 individuals with germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes by matching their information with the German Childhood Cancer Registry.Results:We observed 12 cases of cancer in the entire RASopathy cohort vs 1.12 expected (based on German population-based incidence rates). This corresponds to a 10.5-fold increased risk of all childhood cancers combined (standardised incidence ratio (SIR)=10.5, 95% confidence interval=5.4-18.3). The specific cancers included juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia=4; brain tumour=3; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia=2; rhabdomyosarcoma=2; and neuroblastoma=1. The childhood cancer SIR in Noonan syndrome patients was 8.1, whereas that for Costello syndrome patients was 42.4.Conclusions:These data comprise the first quantitative evidence documenting that the germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes are associated with increased risks of both childhood leukaemia and solid tumours.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.75 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #177: Mitochondrial dysfunction and risk of cancer.
PMID: 25742477
Authors: M. M. Lund, M. M. Melbye, L J LJ. Diaz, M. M. Duno, J. J. Wohlfahrt, J. J. Vissing
Abstract: Background:Mitochondrial mutations are commonly reported in tumours, but it is unclear whether impaired mitochondrial function per se is a cause or consequence of cancer. To elucidate this, we examined the risk of cancer in a nationwide cohort of patients with mitochondrial dysfunction.Methods:We used nationwide results on genetic testing for mitochondrial disease and the Danish Civil Registration System, to construct a cohort of 311 patients with mitochondrial dysfunction. A total of 177 cohort members were identified from genetic testing and 134 genetically untested cohort members were matrilineal relatives to a cohort member with a genetically confirmed maternally inherited mDNA mutation. Information on cancer was obtained by linkage to the Danish Cancer Register. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to assess the relative risk of cancer.Results:During 7334 person-years of follow-up, 19 subjects developed a primary cancer. The corresponding SIR for any primary cancer was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.68-1.63). Subgroup analyses according to mutational subtype yielded similar results, for example, a SIR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.67) for the m.3243A>G maternally inherited mDNA mutation, cases=13.Conclusions:Patients with mitochondrial dysfunction do not appear to be at increased risk of cancer compared with the general population.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.66 www.bjcancer.com.


Title #178: Prognostic and predictive value of immunological parameters for chemoradioimmunotherapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Background:Chemoradioimmunotherapy of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the CapRI trial did not show any benefit of interferon-Î± in addition to a 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based treatment. The aim of this study was to identify immunological parameters in patients from this trial to be used for predictive and/or prognostic purposes.Methods:The following methods were used: tumour immunohistology, FACS analyses, cytokine measurement, as well as cytotoxicity and ELIspot. Immunological parameters were correlated with patients' survival using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Irrespective of therapy type, high lymphocyte accumulation in tumours and frequencies of NK cells and effector (eff) CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood of the patients were associated with patients' survival. Amount of CD3(+) and effector-memory CD8(+) blood lymphocytes, expression of CD152 and interleukin (IL)-2 serum level showed a predictive value for chemoradioimmunotherapy. Tumoural accumulation of CD3(+) and CD8(+) cells was predictive for outcome of chemotherapy alone. Besides, we identified the frequencies of CD3(+) lymphocytes, effCD8(+) T cells and NK cells in the peripheral blood of the patients, and IL-10 amount in serum, to be predictive values for 5FU-based chemotherapy.Conclusions:Immunological parameters, identified in this trial as possible markers, may be of interest in personalized medicine towards the improvement of the treatment and prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma patients.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.72 www.bjcancer.com.
