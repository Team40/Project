Scraper.sh -- Shell script that makes the HTTP request to retrieve the 2000 article IDs for the latest articles posted in PubMed and writes these to output.xml
	-To change the number of article IDs returned, change the retmax parameter in the URL


parser.py -- Python script that pulls each of the articles for the IDs in output.xml and parses the XML output
	-Writes the articles' content in readable form to to articles.txt
	-Writes the articles fields in parsing format to datafile.txt so that they can be read into the database
		To read into the database, navigate to localhost:3000/update when running "rails s" (*** this probably isn't best-practice but provides an easy way to get the data from the python script's output into the local database *** -- in order to push the local database to the live site, see the README in the root directory) 
			-To see/alter how this is done, navigate to app/controllers/publications_controller.rb

	Article fields:
		pmid: PubMed ID for the article
		title: Article title
		author_s: A string with comma separated names of the authors of the paper (First initial + last Name)
		abstract: The article's abstract
		date: The date the article was posted to PubMed
		score: An arbitrary score assigned to articles as a placeholder for user-voted scores (yet to be implemented).
