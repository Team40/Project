Gilleran, David J DJ. Augeri, Ryan S RS. O'Dell, Eric C EC. Olson, S David SD. Kimball, Thomas J TJ. Emge, Liviu L. Movileanu, Darren R DR. Carpizo, Stewart N SN. Loh>><<p53 is a Zn(2+)-dependent tumor suppressor inactivated in >50% of human cancers. The most common mutation, R175H, inactivates p53 by reducing its affinity for the essential zinc ion, leaving the mutant protein unable to bind the metal in the low [Zn(2+)]free environment of the cell. The exploratory cancer drug ZMC1 was previously demonstrated to reactivate this and other Zn(2+)-binding mutants by binding Zn(2+) and buffering it to a level such that Zn(2+) can repopulate the defective binding site, but how it accomplishes this in the context of living cells and organisms is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ZMC1 increases intracellular [Zn(2+)]free by functioning as a zinc ionophore. ZMC1 binds Zn(2+) in the extracellular environment, diffuses across the plasma membrane as the neutral complex, and releases zinc into the cell once again as the Zn(2+) ion. It raises intracellular [Zn(2+)]free in cancer (TOV112D) and non-cancer (HEK293) cell lines to 15.8 and 18.1 nM, respectively, with half times of 2-3 min. These [Zn(2+)]free are predicted to result in ~90% saturation of p53-R175H, thus accounting for its observed reactivation. This mechanism is supported by the x-ray crystal structure of the [Zn(ZMC1)2] complex, which demonstrates structural and chemical features consistent with those of known metal ionophores. These findings provide a physical mechanism linking ZMC1's in vitro and in vivo activities, and define the remaining critical parameter necessary for developing synthetic metallochaperones for clinical use.>>
<<25710966>><<Infant male circumcision and the autonomy of the child: two ethical questions.>><<Akim A. McMath>><<Routine neonatal circumcision-the non-therapeutic circumcision of infant males-has generated considerable ethical controversy. In this article, I suggest that much of the disagreement results from conflicting ideas about the autonomy of the child. I examine two questions about autonomy. First, I ask whether we should be realists or idealists about the future autonomous choices of the child-that is, whether we should account for the fact that the child may not make the best choices in future, or whether we should assume that his future choices will reflect his best interests. Second, I ask whether the child has a right to autonomy with respect to circumcision, an interest in autonomy or neither-that is, whether respect for autonomy overrides considerations of interests, whether it counts as one interest among many or whether it counts for nothing. In response to the first question, I argue that we should be idealists when evaluating the child's own interests, but realists when evaluating public health justifications for circumcision. In response to the second question, I argue that the child has an interest in deciding whether or not to be circumcised, insofar as the decision is more likely to reflect his actual interests and his own values. Finally, I show how these findings may help to resolve some particular disputes over the ethics of infant male circumcision.>>

These proteins confer a growth advantage to their host by increasing its survival. K2 toxin affects the target cell by binding to the cell surface, disrupting the plasma membrane integrity, and inducing ion leakage. In this study, we have determined that K2 toxin saturates the yeast cell surface receptors in 10 minutes. The apparent amount of K2 toxin, bound to a single cell of wild type yeast under saturating conditions, was estimated to be 435-460 molecules. It was found that increased level of Î²-1,6-glucan directly correlates with the number of toxin molecules bound, thereby impacting the morphology and determining the fate of the yeast cell. We observed that the binding of K2 toxin to the yeast surface receptors proceeds in a similar manner as in case of the related K1 killer protein. It was demonstrated that the externally supplied pustulan, a poly-Î²-1,6-glucan, but not the glucans bearing other linkage types (such as laminarin, chitin, and pullulan) efficiently inhibits the K2 toxin killing activity. In addition, the analysis of toxin binding to the intact cells and spheroplasts confirmed that majority of K2 protein molecules attach to the Î²-1,6-glucan, when compared to the plasma membrane-localized receptors. Taken together, our results revealed that Î²-1,6-glucan is a primary target of K2 toxin and is important for the execution of its killing property.>>

Wang>><<Two-component signaling pathways generally include sensor histidine kinases and response regulators. We identified an ortholog of the response regulator protein Skn7, which we named it MrSkn7, in the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii. Gene deletion assays and functional characterizations indicated that MrSkn7 functions as a transcription factor. MrSkn7 null mutant of M. robertsii lost the ability to sporulate and had defects in cell wall biosynthesis but was not sensitive to oxidative and osmotic stresses when compared to the wild type. However, the mutant was able to produce spores under salt stress. Insect bioassays using these spores showed that the mutant virulence was significantly impaired when compared to the wild type due to the failures to form the infection structure appressorium and evade host immunity. In particular, deletion of MrSkn7 triggered cell autolysis with typical features such as cell vacuolization, down-regulation of repressor genes, and up-regulation of autolysis-related genes such as extracellular chitinases and proteases. Promoter binding assays confirmed that MrSkn7 could directly or indirectly control different putative target genes. Taken together, the results of this study help us understand the functional divergence of Skn7 orthologs as well as the mechanisms underlying the development and control of virulence in insect pathogenic fungi.>>

Zanetti>><<Cellular immune responses that protect against tumors typically have been attributed to CD8 T cells. However, CD4 T cells also play a central role. It was shown recently that, in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, CD4 T cells specific for a peptide from a mutated region of ERBB2IP could arrest tumor progression. This and other recent findings highlight new opportunities for CD4 T cells in cancer immunotherapy. In this article, I discuss the role and regulation of CD4 T cells in response to tumor Ags. Emphasis is placed on the types of Ags and mechanisms that elicit tumor-protective responses. I discuss the advantages and drawbacks of cancer immunotherapy through personalized genomics. These considerations should help to guide the design of next-generation therapeutic cancer vaccines.>>

A. Manoharan, J E JE. Brown, T F TF. Watson, A. A. Banerjee>><<The aims of this study were to assess the effectiveness of calcium silicate cement (Biodentine) versus glass ionomer cement (GIC; control group) as indirect pulp capping materials in patients with reversible pulpitis and to compare the effectiveness of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) versus periapical (PA) radiographs in detecting PA changes at baseline (T0) and at 12 mo (T12) postoperatively. Seventy-two restorations (36 Biodentine, 36 Fuji IX) were placed randomly in 53 patients. CBCT/PA radiographs were taken at T0 and T12. Two calibrated examiners assessed the presence/absence and increase/decrease in the size of existing PA radiolucencies under standardized conditions. The Kappa coefficient evaluated statistically the effectiveness of CBCT versus PA radiographs in detecting PA changes. Chi-square/Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate the association between PA changes in CBCT with various clinical measures. Significance was predetermined at Î± = 0.05. Clinical success rates for Biodentine and Fuji IX GIC were 83.3%. CBCT was significantly more effective in detecting PA radiolucencies compared with radiographs (P = 0.0069). Of the teeth, 65.4% and 90.4% were deemed healthy using CBCT and PA radiographs, respectively, at T12. Healing/healed rates were 17.3%/0%, while new/progressed radiolucency were 30.8%/9.6% with CBCT/PA radiographs, respectively. Seventy-one percent of healed lesions had received Biodentine; 88% of new/progressed lesions received Fuji IX GIC. Teeth presenting with an initial CBCT PA lesion had a failure rate of 63%, whereas teeth with no initial lesion had a failure rate of 16%. Although no statistically significant difference was detected in the clinical efficacy of Biodentine/Fuji IX when used as indirect pulp capping materials in patients with reversible pulpitis, CBCT showed a significant difference in that most healed CBCT lesions had received Biodentine while most that did not heal received Fuji IX. Longer-term follow-up is needed to establish their effect on the healing dynamics of PA tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02201641).>>

Li>><<While nuclear medicine has been proven clinically effective for examination of the change in bone turnover as a result of stress injury, quantitative correlation between tracer uptake and mechanical stimulation in the human jawbone remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between bone metabolism observed by 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) images and mechanical stimuli obtained by finite element analysis (FEA) in the residual ridge induced by the insertion of a removable partial denture (RPD). An 18F-fluoride PET/CT (computerized tomography) scan was performed to assess the change of bone metabolism in the residual ridge under the denture before and after RPD treatment. Corresponding patient-specific 3D finite element (FE) models were created from CT images. Boundary conditions were prescribed by the modeling of condylar contacts, and muscular forces were derived from the occlusal forces measured in vivo to generate mechanobiological reactions. Different mechanobiological stimuli, e.g., equivalent von Mises stress (VMS), equivalent strain (EQV), and strain energy density (SED), determined from nonlinear FEA, were quantified and compared with the standardized uptake values (SUVs) of PET. Application of increased occlusal force after RPD insertion induced higher mechanical stimuli in the residual bone. Accordingly, SUV increased in the region of residual ridge with higher mechanical stimuli. Thus, with SUV, a clear correlation was observed with VMS and SED in the cancellous bone, especially after RPD insertion (R(2) > 0.8, P < 0.001). This study revealed a good correlation between bone metabolism and mechanical stimuli induced by RPD insertion. From this patient-specific study, it was shown that metabolic change detected by PET in the loaded bone, in a much shorter duration than conventional x-ray assessment, is associated with mechanical stimuli. The nondestructive nature of PET/CT scans and FEA could potentially provide a new method for clinical examination and monitoring of prosthetically driven bone remodeling.>>

Tu>><<For shallow or moderately deep pit-and-fissure lesions, various treatment options are available: (1) noninvasive treatments (e.g., fluoride application, antibacterial treatments, oral hygiene advice) avoid any dental hard tissue removal; (2) microinvasive treatments (e.g., sealing) remove only a few micrometers of hard tissues by etching; and minimally invasive methods (e.g., "preventive" resin/sealant restoration) remove carious dentin but avoid sacrificing sound tissues. We aimed at systematically reviewing and comparing these strategies for treating pit-and-fissure lesions in permanent teeth using network meta-analysis. Randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials investigating shallow or moderately deep primary caries lesions in fissured or pitted surfaces were included. We compared the risk of requiring invasive treatments or any retreatments in noninvasive, microinvasive, and minimally invasive treated lesions; untreated lesions were used as controls. Five electronic databases were systematically screened up to September 2013 and cross-referencing performed. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated. Certainty of estimates was evaluated via GRADE criteria. From a total of 2,214 identified records, 14 studies representing 1,440 patients with 3,551 treated lesions were included. Pairwise meta-analysis found microinvasive and minimally invasive treated lesions to require less invasive retreatments than control lesions (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 0.13 [0.07 to 0.26], 0.13 [0.03 to 0.50], respectively), whereas the estimate for noninvasively treated lesions remained nonsignificant (0.64 [0.39 to 1.06]). These findings were reflected in the strategy ranking stemming from network meta-analysis (first, minimally invasive; second, microinvasive; third, noninvasive). However, microinvasive treatment required significantly total retreatments (including resealing) than minimally or noninvasive treatments. Due to limited study quality, the evidence was graded as low or very low. Clinical treatment decisions should consider the long-term sequelae and costs stemming from different therapies as well as their subjective impact on the patient. Available treatment options seem suitable for treating shallow or moderately deep pit-and-fissure lesions in permanent teeth; further conclusions are not possible.>>
<<25710950>><<Infection and Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw.>><<H. H. Katsarelis, N P NP. Shah, D K DK. Dhariwal, M. M. Pazianas>><<Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), although initially believed to be exclusively associated with bisphosphonates, has been implicated in recent reports with additional drugs, especially the bone antiresorptive denosumab. The pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated, and no causal association between bone antiresorptive regimens and MRONJ has yet been established. However, reduced bone turnover and infection, an almost universal finding, are thought to be central to the pathogenesis of MRONJ. Both bisphosphonates and denosumab, through different pathways of action, significantly reduce the rate of bone turnover and potentially reduce the efficacy of the host defense against infection. Recent evidence questions the simplified etiology of low bone turnover causing MRONJ and offers evidence on the prominent role of infection instead. The management of MRONJ remains a significant clinical challenge, with little progress having been made on treatment. The aim of this article is to explore the current theories on the etiology of MRONJ and to emphasize the importance of infection in the development of this devastating pathology.>>
